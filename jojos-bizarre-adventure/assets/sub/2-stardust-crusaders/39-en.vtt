00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.420
C-Crap!

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.970
He blocked the exit with
ice when I wasn't looking!

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.800
The ice is coming this way!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.630
Shit!

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.330
Ice is running all over the tunnel!

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.220
I-I've got to get out of this tunnel!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.090
What?! M-My foot!

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.610
I-I can't get my foot out!

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.230
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

Episode 39  The Guardian
of Hell, Pet Shop, Part 2

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.990
Hey, the sun's about to set.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.280
Despite how confident

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.730
that beggar sounded about finding DIO's
mansion from the photo within three hours,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.200
This story is fiction. The characters, groups, places, laws, and names
used in this program have no connection to any existing in real life.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.210
it looks like he was wrong.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.440
Eh, Avdol?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.940
It's occurred to me that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.890
it might be better if he didn't find it.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.510
It may be

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.390
that he did find it,
and that's why he hasn't returned.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.850
Hey...

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.830
There could be a Stand user that prevents

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.190
people from getting close to the mansion.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.360
It might have been too
dangerous to ask that beggar

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.160
to find the mansion for us.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.240
Hey, now...

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.160
M-My leg...

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.820
My leg...

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.690
It got chopped off by that icicle.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.510
If I didn't abandon my leg,
I would have been finished.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.380
I-I should hide here for a while.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.410
I need to hide here and get him off my tail.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.670
I'll have the Speedwagon Foundation
make me an artificial leg.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.180
God damn that birdbrain!

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.920
You're not going to get away with this.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.300
I will get you back for this. Damn it!

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.540
That noise...

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.680
It's the sound of something
diving into the water.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.310
I-It can't be...

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.070
It is not impossible for a
bird to dive underwater.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.360
Birds use lungs to breathe,
just like humans and dogs.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.300
But they also have air sacs that store air,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.190
located in five to six places
in their chests and abdomens.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:18.790
Air Sac                                       Lungs                          Air Sac

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.280
Because of these air sacs,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.350
birds are able to fly at an altitude of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.070
six to seven thousand meters,
where humans would fall comatose.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.240
Even if they were being strangled,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.490
because of the supply of
oxygen in their bodies,

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.120
birds could survive a few minutes.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.100
This means that a bird can stay
underwater much longer than a dog.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.030
S-Something's coming closer through the water.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.780
That's impossible!

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.470
I don't want to believe it,

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.320
but the sound heading
straight this way has to be...

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.770
It couldn't be!

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.080
It can't be!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.660
That asshole bird!

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.800
It actually dove into the
water to come after me!

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.400
That bastard... Where'd he go?!

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.490
I-It's coming! It's coming again!

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.750
His ice. One... two... three.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.530
Th-Three shots are coming!

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.160
Bash

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.270
I deflected them!

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.420
Stab

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.190
I-I did it. Serves you right!

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.420
Th-The water's stopped dripping in...

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.290
And the icicle's starting to
freeze over again from the root.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.250
Wh-What the hell?

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.430
I-I get it.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.180
He's freezing all of the water

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.420
surrounding this area!

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.980
The airway's been cut off!

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.280
B-But he's not trying to suffocate me.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.780
He's trying to crush me!

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.540
It's no use. It's gonna collapse!

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.790
This power's ridiculous! I can't hold out!

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.300
There's infinite water around
me that he can freeze.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.870
Damn it!

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.310
I thought I was hiding in the water,
but instead, I've been cornered!

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.560
I-I'm just going to have
to dig my way out.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.670
Man, today is really not my day!

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.610
My front leg gets ripped off,
and that damn bird is too strong!

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.510
I'm at my limit. I'm going to be crushed.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.680
I have to hurry up and dig a hole to escape.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.750
Huh?

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:37.850
What's that? There's some kind
of hollow space inside...

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.780
It's the birdbrain!

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.170
Open

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.460
He's gonna shoot an ice missile!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.270
Crap! The Fool is behind me!

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.230
I don't have time to defend.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.480
There's no way out, either!

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.200
I know! I-I'll just have to do this.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.910
If I don't, he'll kill me!

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.750
I'll let him crush it

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.370
on purpose,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.970
and let the air pressure
launch me forward!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.380
I-I did it. I defeated him.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.750
Stupid birdbrain. Serves you right...

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.390
B-But I'm done for.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.000
I've lost a lot of blood,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.270
and I don't have the
strength to swim to shore...

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.120
I-I'm gonna drown.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.960
And here I thought I'd live
a life free of trouble...

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.790
Damn it,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.350
I messed up...

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.540
I can't believe it!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.570
I was just passing by and you
happened to drift by on the river.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.240
That bird got you, didn't it?
Just like he got my dogs...

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.590
It's okay.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.620
I don't think that bird's close by.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.450
Don't die! Hang in there!

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.740
I'll patch you right up.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.290
The bastard bird, Pet Shop,
and his Stand, Horus: dead.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.870
Bastard Bird
Pet Shop - Stand: Horus -
Dead

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.980
Horus

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.980
Pet Shop

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.620
Damn that Iggy! Where the hell did he go?

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.500
He's gotta stop making trouble for us.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.800
I'm worried. We haven't
seen him for quite a while.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.580
That stupid mutt!

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.510
What's the matter, Jotaro?

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.680
Is someone following us after all?

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.080
No... I thought I heard a voice calling for us.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.000
A voice?

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.450
I-Iggy?!

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.960
Iggy!

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.670
What in the world happened?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.010
Iggy's been badly injured!

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.180
Hey... He's missing a front leg...

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.940
D-Did he get run over by a car?

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.000
He's not the kind of dog
that gets into car accidents.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.570
You were attacked by the
enemy, weren't you, Iggy?

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:57.110
But it looks like someone treated his wounds.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.990
And with perfect surgical technique.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.370
It wasn't Iggy's voice.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.750
Someone was calling to us in human language.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.830
It appears that Iggy had
a run-in with the enemy.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:17.340
I saw a boy holding him as he lay dying.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.230
The one who treated him is a doctor
from the Speedwagon Foundation.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.350
Just like the one

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:25.270
who treated my eyes.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.850
Y-You're...

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.990
Kakyoin!

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.310
It's Kakyoin! Hey!

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.740
Kakyoin, are your eyes okay now?

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.570
I'm glad you're all safe.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.060
It's great to see you!

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.190
Have your wounds healed?

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.070
Yes. I'm fine now.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.230
It left a few scars, but my
vision has completely returned.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.970
That's good to hear.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.040
Jotaro...

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.060
Hey, Iggy. Where are you going?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.040
Iggy, who had no interest
in humans or Stands,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.740
is apparently trying to lead us somewhere.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.720
I'm not sure what happened while
he was fighting the enemy's Stand,

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.400
but he seems rather angry about
how much pain he endured.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:33.020
Just where is he trying to lead us?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.760
Hey, Iggy, hold on.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.230
Th-That car...

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.460
It's the luxury car that beggar was riding in.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.280
Th-This wreckage is...

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.700
What did this? There's a huge hole,
like something gigantic pierced it.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.220
It's just as I feared.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.580
I knew I shouldn't have asked him...

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.340
Is this the work of the
Stand user that Iggy fought?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.450
It seems there can be little doubt.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.900
Iggy!

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.680
Hey, what is this?

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.820
I'm in a cold sweat all of a sudden.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.580
This overwhelmingly oppressive feeling...

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.830
Where's Iggy

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.360
t-trying to take us?

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.100
I already know. This atmosphere is...

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.350
This dark sensation...

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.940
Th-This mansion is...

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.190
The one from the picture.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.280
Who would have thought you'd
be the one to find it, Iggy?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.760
The mansion that stood before Jotaro,

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.130
projecting an abnormally sinister energy,

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:50.730
housed the cause of all they've been through,
their destiny: the embodiment of evil.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.180
They had journeyed long
and far to reach this place.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.980
They traveled through many lands,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.230
encountering DIO's countless
Stand-using assassins.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:06.340
It was, indeed, a series of life-or-death battles
that were no simple task to survive.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.740
Tears, laughter, sadness, rage, and happiness.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.130
They experienced many
emotions on this journey.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:19.020
In order to save Jotaro's mother, Holly,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.500
it has indeed been nearly fifty
days since they left Japan.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:30.520
All to defeat DIO, and end
this hundred-year-old destiny.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.420
Joseph thought to himself.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.540
He was determined to reach his goal

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.510
and save his daughter Holly, no matter what!

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.920
Kakyoin thought to himself.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.610
In order to save Holly, and to conquer
the weakness in his own heart,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.990
they would defeat DIO, no matter what.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.640
Avdol thought to himself.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.440
There was evil this world that must not

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.160
be allowed to prosper,
and so, must be destroyed.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.550
Polnareff thought to himself.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.540
He would make DIO pay

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.110
for manipulating him with
a flesh bud to make him

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.170
act against his own righteousness.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.960
Iggy thought to himself.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.410
The reason he had to endure

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.330
all this absurdity was
because of that bastard DIO.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.560
So he was going to pay him
back for it, no matter what.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.270
And...

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.480
In other words, if we beat the shit out of DIO

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.900
right here and now, it will all be over.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.500
He's here. There's no doubt
about it, this presence is his.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:36.650
Rumble

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.560
He's inside this mansion right now.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:32.550
Which means that we...

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.660
...have finally reached the
last stop on our journey.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.060
Are you ready?

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.150
Bam

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.080
The gate's open.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.200
We can just walk in.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.730
But it was closed yesterday...

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.540
Just as I can sense his presence,
he is aware that I have arrived.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.270
Entering this mansion carelessly

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.050
would be like being swallowed by the enemy.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.610
Now...

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.800
What to do...

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.350
The door opened! Watch out!

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.800
Hey, look at this corridor.
I don't see any end to it.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.120
It's not real, is it?

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.540
It's some kind of trick or illusion, right?

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.910
Polnareff, don't go through that door.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.490
We should see at least one
or two Stand users before DIO.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.970
What the?! Something's coming!

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.060
Who the hell's that? Is he a Stand user?

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.760
Welcome.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.430
Master Joestar, we have
been awaiting your arrival.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.480
I am the butler of this mansion.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.010

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:26.850
Allow me to wager

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.280
that Star Platinum's first
attack against me will...

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.140
Jotaro, blast him!

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.800
Take that corner at full throttle!

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.710
If we don't defeat you,
we won't be able to proceed.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.030
Exactly! That is indeed correct.
