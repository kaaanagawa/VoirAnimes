EDO - YOSHIWARA

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.000
Hey! This all started
ever since you got here, you know!

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.380
How many people do you think
have vanished from this House?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.510
What is it that you're doing on the sly?

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.010
EPISODE 3:
WHAT ARE YOU?

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.810
TOKYO - YOSHIWARA

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.820
So, this is it. Ogimoto House.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.590
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT - OGIMOTO HOUSE

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.590
Now then, answer me.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.430
Who were you writing these letters to?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.180
What was your name again?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.350
Oh, that's right. It's Makio.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.190
Answer me...

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.020
Makio.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.700
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT - KYOGOKU HOUSE

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.710
It seems like I lost sight of who I was.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.670
I'm supposed to be looking
for Uzui's wife, Hinatsuru.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.970
What good would it do
to hone my shamisen and koto skills?

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.970
Still, what am I going to do?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.980
I've been all ears since I got here,
but I haven't heard a word about Hinatsuru.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.020
It was two days ago that the owner
of this House passed away, huh?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.980
Everyone's gloomy,
and they're keeping their mouths shut.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.320
Get that for me, will you?

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.740
I can't find my sash!

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.490
I'm so hungry!

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.740
Has the hairdresser arrived yet?

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.540
We have a crisis!

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.880
A young girl is crying!

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.800
Someone else is on their way.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.630
Ogimoto House certainly has
no shortage of busybodies.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.970
I have to find a way to let him know!

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.930
Lord Tengen!

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.990
Make a commotion, and I'll pulverize
all of the organs in your body.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.950
That must be the food that woman left.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.500
So it means that's Makio's room, huh?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.130
It's odd. It feels so odd!

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.630
Is she in some kind of trouble now?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.510
I can't tell.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.760
I'm getting this slimy, creepy vibe, but...

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.850
Huh! Sitting here thinking
and not doing a thing...

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.560
That's not my style!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.900
The wind...

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.450
Even though the windows are closed!

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.490
The attic...

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.250
Hey!

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.790
Damn you!

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.870
I'm onto you!

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.210
What the...

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.970
It's clattering around in the ceiling!

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.930
It's a demon just like I thought!

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.720
Where's it heading?
Where's it running off to?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.850
OGIMOTO HOUSE

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.350
Out of my way!

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.100
I'm not letting you get away!

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.280
What's going on?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.740
It's daytime, so it escaped up there.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.160
But it has to climb down the walls
at some point!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Right there!

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.420
Hey! Now there's a sweet young thing—

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.590
You punched him!

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.430
Dammit! I messed up!

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.100
It's fleeing downstairs!

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.060
This way?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.230
No.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.440
It's this way!

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.190
Dammit!

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.860
It's hard to get a feel for it!

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.860
I lost sight of it!

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.740
Dammit!

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.910
It's all because people got in my way!

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.500
Hey! It's like a disaster struck here!
What happened in this room?

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.250
Huh?

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.550
W-Were you in a fight?

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.510
Are you okay?

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.010
Hey!

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.390
A-Are you all right?

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.520
Come on, settle down, okay?

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.650
I wasn't angry with you, all right?

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.690
Sorry about that.
If you're in any kind of trouble—

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.860
Hey you...

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.700
What are you doing in my room?

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.210
That's a demon standing behind me.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.210
That's not what a human sounds like.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.590
I didn't even notice her
until right before she spoke to me.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.670
I-Is that even possible?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.970
This sound is bad news,

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.970
but it's so quiet that I'm actually terrified!

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.230
This must be...

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.270
an U-Upper Rank demon, right?

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.480
Hey!

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.030
Are you hard of hearing or something?

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.200
W-Warabihime Oiran...

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.740
That girl just started here
the day before yesterday, so...

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.620
Hah! So what if she did?

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.880
Forgive me for entering
without permission!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.630
The room's in such disarray,
and this girl was crying, so...

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:59.640
Could you be any uglier?
You really make me ill.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.640
Wouldn't you be better off dead?

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.730
What's up with that hair color of yours?

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.150
Do you actually want to stand out?

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.910
This room is still in a shambles.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.290
I thought I told you to clean it up.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.920
Shut up!

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.460
Stop that screaming!

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.460
You clean up this room!

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.840
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.340
I'll do it right now! Please forgive me!

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.520
What?

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.560
Please...

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.350
take your hands off her!

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.980

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.870
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT - TOKITO HOUSE

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.390
Madam, I've finished scrubbing the hallways,
and the mizukiri and mizuage for the flowers,

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.690
and changed the water!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.060
What? Already?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.900
What shall I do next?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.070
N-Next? Um...

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.610
Here's a fresh cup of tea, Madam!

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.450
Oh, sorry to trouble you.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.410
Not at all!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.740
Madam, what next?

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000
Madam, what next?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.330
Madam!

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.000
Would you be quiet? Just hold on for a second!

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.090
You're a quick worker
and such a diligent child, aren't you?

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.730
That new girl went
and smashed up the house!

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.730
It looks like I need to teach that one
a harsh lesson!

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.570
Hey, Inoko!

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.650
What on earth are you doing?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.780
I can't sense it even if I focus.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.660
Where the hell did it go?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.300
What did you say?

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.680
Let's hear you say that again.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.180
Please take your hands off her.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.190
Up close, you're even uglier than I thought.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.900
Take your—

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.820
How dare you...

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.990
touch me!

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.870
TWO DAYS BEFORE

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.620
TANJIRO AND THE OTHERS

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.370
INFILTRATED

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.410
KYOGOKU HOUSE

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.880
I want you to stop it right now!

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.880
Stop what?

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.140
Stop causing people here to get hurt
and commit Ashinuke and suicide! That's what!

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.970
As for the ones who killed themselves,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.060
you may as well have bullied them
to death, Warabihime!

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.730
That's a harsh thing to say, Madam.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.740
You're not going to take my side, then?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.200
You don't think it's their own fault
for irritating me?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.910
Until now, I've looked the other way
more times than I can count!

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.170
But something's not right about you!

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.250
I can't protect you anymore!

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:08.720
And exactly whose earnings was it
that allowed this House to prosper so, you hag?

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.600
Years and years ago,

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.980
when I was still a child...

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.980
the old lady from the teahouse
told me a story.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.650
She'd become profoundly forgetful,
but she told me about a certain Oiran.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.660
She was incredibly beautiful,
but also incredibly twisted by nature.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.660
The old lady said that she'd seen
such Oirans when she was a child,

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.670
and again,
when she was middle-aged.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:45.720
YATAMAHIME

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.550
These Oirans were fond
of assuming names ending with "hime,"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.670
and if anything were to irritate them,

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.680
they'd cock their heads to the side
and glare at you from below.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.470
That was a unique habit they shared.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.350
You!

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.680
Who are you?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.440
Could it be...

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.520
th-that you...

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.690
You're not human?

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.450
That's the kind of thing...

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.120
that you should keep your mouth
shut about when you realize it.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.460
It's the smart way to live.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.960
That's how everyone's survived until now.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:34.100
But it looks like you're far more stupid
than I ever thought.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.600
It's a real pity, Omitsu.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:52.870
UPPER SIX

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.020
There's no need for you
to be so scared!

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.070
The dried-out flesh of old hags
like you tastes horrible.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:52.870
If it's ugly or dirty, there's no way
I'd ever put it in my mouth!

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.870
Goodbye, Omitsu.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:56.870
Stop...

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.000
Stop!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.970
What the...

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.430
She's dead!

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.510
She fell! Who is it?

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.890
No!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.510
Isn't that the madam?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.020
Hurry! Somebody call
the House Master right away!

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.650
How are you doing?

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.990
Master Muzan!

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.070
I can see that you've devoured
scores of humans.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.450
You've gained
even more power than before.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.000
That's a good thing.

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.000
Yes!

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.830
But you mustn't let your guard down.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.670
The more things go your way, the more apt you are
to get the rug pulled out from under you.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.800
Understood!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.140
A skilled member of the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.680
a Hashira, could recognize us
as demons right away.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:03.770
On the other hand, aside from those
as capable as Hashira,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.650
we cannot see any differences
between humans at a glance.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.610
Although we can distinguish them
by blood type, disease and genes...

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:17.030
Things that humans
have no knowledge of.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.580
Daki...

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.460
Yes?

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.580
Yes, Master Muzan?

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.590
I have high hopes for you.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.880
No one is as beautiful as you.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.090
Nor as strong.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.350
You've disposed of seven Hashira.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.440
You're going to become
even more powerful from here on out.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.810
You'll become cruel.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.900
You're an extraordinary demon.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.920
Don't you dare touch me
in such a familiar way!

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.630
Don't flatter yourself,
you rotten little punk!

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.260
It looks like you're in need of some discipline!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.630
Some severe discipline!

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.140
Warabihime Oiran...

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.390
I beg of you.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.470
Please.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.100
Please forgive her.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.060
It's almost time for us to open.
Our customers will be arriving.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.740
I'll be sure to reprimand her harshly.
So please, for now...

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.740
Please, just help me save some face.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.880
I suppose I may have lashed out
at this newcomer too mercilessly.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.250
Tend to her wounds, please.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.380
Master, please raise your head.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.430
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.010
Lately, so many things
have left me feeling irritated.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.770
I'm heading off to work,
so get this place tidied up right now.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.270
Y-Yes, ma'am!

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.570
Call for some help!
Get this room cleaned up!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.650
Don't do anything that would
get on Warabihime Oiran's nerves!

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.370
That little brat...

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.660
From what I can sense,
his injuries are only minor.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.370
Even though he's blacked out...

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.040
he went on the defensive.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.380
He's no civilian.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.670
He's probably with the Demon Slayer Corps!

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.340
That said, he doesn't have
the skill of a Hashira.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:58.650
It took you a bit of time,
but you did a good job bringing him in.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.910
Just keep them coming.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.160
I'll be happy to kill and devour them all.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.720
There's a murky scent in the air.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.680
At night, in this city...

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.560
there's a murky scent in the air.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.860
Zenko!

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.740
Zenko!

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.200
Thank goodness!

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.830
Are you okay, Zenko?

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.920
What happened to me?

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.180
You got punched, Zenko,
and you blacked out!

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.970
Oh...

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.810
That's right! My name is Zenko!

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.180
I had a dream that I'd become a man.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.520
We brought you some food,
so be sure to have it.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.110
Use this to cool down your cheek.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.860
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.940
Are you okay?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.820
Yes. It's not as bad as it looks.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.200
I don't think.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.490
Zenko, thank you.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.410
Huh?

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.120
This is what you got for defending me.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:00.880
Any man would rescue
a damsel in distress. That's a given.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.630
Not that I'm a man, all right?
What I mean is, any human would, see?

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.470
For instance,
the eldest daughter or whatever!

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:11.390
I'm the eldest daughter, so I can't stand by
while a younger girl weeps! Not normally!

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.140
That's not true.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:18.020
Everyone here has their hands full
just taking care of themselves.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.150
We've never met
a kindhearted person like you before.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.450
See you later, Zenko!

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:28.780
Take care of yourself!

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.740
Get lots of rest, okay?

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.740
Right.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.910
Thanks!

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.930
NIN-NIN

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.470
Combined Junior
and Senior High School!

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.470
Tales of a Demon Slayer
Academy! Christmas Arc!

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.940
Today's the day I've been waiting for!
It's Christmas!

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.810
I've invited Nezuko to the Christmas party.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.530
My planning was flawless. We can proceed
straight from the party to the wedding.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.700
Hey, she's here! Nezuko's here!

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.700
EXCITED

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.830
Welcome! I've been waiting for you!

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.910
Thank you for inviting us to your party!

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.410
I did you a solid and showed up!

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.290
Merry Christmas.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.830
FLAME

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.830
So what's Christmas? Tell me!

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.040
I never invited you guys!

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.800
And what's with those outfits?

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.920
Talk about mangling stuff up big time!

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.890
None of you have ever been invited
to a Christmas party, am I right?

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:31.930
Stop fooling around!

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:31.930
ZENITSU HAS NEVER BEEN INVITED, EITHER

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.720
Everyone except Nezuko, go home!

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.020
What did you say?
Tell me what Christmas is, dammit!

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.270
Shut up! Do you hear me?

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.060
