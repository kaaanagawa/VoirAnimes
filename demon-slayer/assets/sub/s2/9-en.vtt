WEBVTT

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.600
Entertainment District?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.440
You know, that thing!
Know what I mean?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.400
The place where...

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.610
Huh? You don't get it?

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.950
Listen up!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
I am a god!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.620
You three are...

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.040
trash!

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.380
That's the first thing
you need to pound into your heads!

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.710
Drive it in!

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.960
You're to turn into dogs if I tell you to!

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.220
Arf, arf, arf, arf!

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.260
Turn into monkeys if I say so!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.590
Woo-hoo!

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.890
Hunch over and rub your hands together,
constantly pander to my every whim

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.890
You said it!

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.600
and suck up to me
with every fiber of your being!

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.600
That's our Lord Uzui all right!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
Yep.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.100
And let me repeat!

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.610
I am a god!

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.110
This guy is crazy!

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.530
What are you the god of, specifically?

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.790
I don't believe this guy!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.830
Good question!

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.870
You have potential!

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.920
But it's a stupid question!
What potential?

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.920
The God of Flashiness.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.170
I'm the God of Festivals.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.630
What an idiot.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.930
He's the God of Stupidity.
No question about it.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.770
I'm the King of the Mountains!
Nice to meet you...

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.940
God of Festivals!

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.320
What are you talking about?

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.940
You sure are creepy!

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280
No! You two are a close match
for each other! Cringeworthy!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.490
Huh? What did you say?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.910
Back off, Inosuke!

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.910
Creepy.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.540
Let me go, Konpochiro!

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.880
So, he only has distaste for those
living in the same dimension.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.170
So, there's no time to fool around.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.510
Let's go.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.170
Follow me.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.100
Huh?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.430
He vanished?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.270
Whoa!

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.850
So fast! Look how far he's gone!

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.060
He's no bigger than a sesame seed now!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.440
So, this is the power
of the God of Festivals.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.950
No, that man is Tengen Uzui, a Hashira.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.910
We have to go after him!
Go after him!

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.580
Please be careful!

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.490
Please be careful!

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.870
Safe travels!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.010
EPISODE 2:
INFILTRATING THE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.870
Listen, you three.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.240
Don't do anything
that'll make you stand out.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.910
Remember that we're only here
to case the joint.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.670
Whatever you do,
don't get out of the carriage.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.170
Hey! Don't do it, Zenitsu!

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.000
Inosuke!

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.630
Come back here!

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.470
Those stinking brats!

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.180
Settle down, Inosuke!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.810
Get back here, dammit!

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.060
Hey, Yellow Boy! Stay where you are!

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.690
This is...

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.740
It looks like it's daytime.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.990
This is the Yoshiwara Entertainment District.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.320
Awash in vanity
and desire of men and women.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.780
A town of the night
swirling with love and hate.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.580
Flashy, huh?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.790
What the heck is this?

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.330
It's teeming with people!

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.170
Comin' through!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.010
What the... Calm down, moron!

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.010
DESTROY

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.600
Hey! Where did the kid
with the yellow head go?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.390
What?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.520
You there, Yellow Boy!

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.310
Why don't you stop by?

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.270
We have candy!

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.240
Come on! This way!

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.830
This place is full of beautiful ladies!

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.670
Shut the hell up!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.130
You're too young for this!

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.010
Take a good look.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.600
See, this place goes to sleep during the day,
and at night, it sparkles and dazzles.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.680
The ideal place for a demon, am I right?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.860
Women who become prostitutes
are mostly sold here due to poverty and debt.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.570
In return, they're given food,
clothing and lodging,

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.240
and if they can climb up the ranks,
a rich man might buy out their contracts.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.450
There are ranks among prostitutes, as well.
The highest-ranked "Oiran" is on a different level.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.870
Beauty is a given, and she's also intelligent
and has mastered every traditional art.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.460
She's the breadwinner, on whom
each house has lavished time and money.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.500
A woman of distinction.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.760
Is that right?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.680
All right, that's enough scouting.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.140
Come on.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.430
WISTERIA

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.810
Sorry to impose!

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.610
Now listen up.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.110
When you've infiltrated the Entertainment
District, first look for my bride.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.700
I'll be digging for information
on the demons, as well.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.950
This is outrageous!

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.120
Huh?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.250
I'll thank you not to mess with us!

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.290
How dare you use your subordinates
to personally find a bride for yourself!

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.670
Huh? How did you get that idea?

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.590
Nope! I'm going to have my say!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.920
Zenitsu!

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.890
I'm sure that a screwed-up oddball like you
has no luck with the ladies! However! Even so!

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.600
Just because you want a wife,
that's no reason to use Demon Slayers like us!

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.730
Are you an idiot? I'm talking about a wife
who's infiltrated the Entertainment District

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.350
and is hard at work
gathering intel on the demons!

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.360
I've stopped receiving regular check-ins,
so I'm going, too, all right?

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.700
I suppose that's what you fantasize.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.160
You damn punk!

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.910
These are the letters
sent via the Kasugai Crow.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.710
There's quite a lot of them.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.290
Has she been undercover
for a long time?

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.210
Well, I do have three of them. Wives.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.340
Three of them...

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.970
Wives?

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.930
Th-Three? Why, you... Why, you...

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.100
Why would you have three of them?

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.270
You've got a problem with that?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:37.370
Um, in the letters, they keep reminding you
not to stand out when you come.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.240
That's what I told you, remember?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.330
So, what are we going to do, exactly?

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.960
Well, of course, disguise yourselves.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.840
As much as I hate it, in a drab way.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.720
All three of my wives
are brilliant ninjas. Kunoichi.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.300
I was sure that this district would be
the perfect place for the demons,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.600
but when I went in as a customer,
I couldn't get anything on them.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.350
So I sent them in
to get closer than a customer ever could.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.690
Since I've already narrowed down
the likeliest houses to three,

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.860
you three will search for my wives there
and gather information.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.990
Suma of the Tokito House,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.030
Makio of the Ogimoto House,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.370
and Hinatsuru of the Kyogoku House.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.870
Your wives must be dead,
don't you think?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.790
Pardon me.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.000
I have brought you
the items you asked for.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.510
Thanks.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.020
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.650
My, my... Now these three are certainly...

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.030
quite homely girls, aren't they?

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.030
INOKO

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.030
SUMIKO

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.030
ZENKO

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.960
No, I don't think we can...

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.870
Isn't there any way you can reconsider?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.630
Under your training, Madam,
I'm sure they'd turn into diamonds.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.220
I'm sorry, but...

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.890
Well, I guess taking in one
wouldn't be a problem!

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.310
Then, please take one.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.640
Sorry to impose, Madam.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.110
Then, I think we'll take
the one in the middle!

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.900
She looks very obedient.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.900
I promise to work as hard as I can!

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.900
SUMIKO: EMPLOYED

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.820
You guys are beyond hopeless!

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.410
I can barely give you away!

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.170
I'm not talking to you, all right?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.460
Are you incensed because I made you
disguise yourself as a girl?

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.420
You said you'd do anything I asked!

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.180
I don't give a damn
about dressing like a girl, moron!

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.640
It's that face of yours!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.220
Look at you! You're a stud!

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.810
Don't screw with me!

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.060
Hey! Over there!
A bunch of people are swarming around!

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.220
Oh, that's a procession of Courtesans.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.890
That's Tokito House's Koinatsu Oiran.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.140
The highest-ranking Courtesan
is going off to meet her client.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.520
How flashy is that?

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.310
Wife? Is she your wife, by any chance?

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.270
Is that knockout your wife?
That's too much!

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.900
You've got three of them!
Are they all beautiful like her?

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.650
She's not my wife!

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.160
She walks so slow.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.740
She'd get killed in a second
in the mountains.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.250
Hey, mister...

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.710
I'll be taking this girl
back to my house.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.840
Is that all right?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.260
Hey, so you're...

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.930
The Ogimoto House chaperone.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.640
If she's caught the eye of the Ogimoto House,
I couldn't be more thankful.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.060
But what kind of stroke of luck is this?

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.150
Oh please, I have a sure eye
for these things.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.110
Take care of yourself, Inoko!

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.150
INOKO: EMPLOYED

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.830
Oh no! I'm the only leftover!

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.950
REJECTED

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.960
OGIMOTO HOUSE

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.960
What do you think?

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.710
Oh my! Unbelievable!

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
They'd plastered her face in a bizarre way,
but just look at her now that it's off!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.590
What a steal!
Buying such a beauty so cheap!

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.010
I'll train her like nobody's business!

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.730
I'll make sure she's in more demand than Kyogoku
House's Warabihime or Tokito House's Koinatsu!

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.980
Yes, but this girl is actually quite sturdy!

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.610
Well, it's better for a girl
to be plump and meaty, right?

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.030
I think she's more muscular than plump.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:35.250
KYOGOKU HOUSE

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.270
Oh, that girl can
really play the shamisen!

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.740
Yes, she's so dynamic!

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.280
Did she join us recently?

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.070
She seems to have a good ear.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.160
I was told that she can play the shamisen
or koto after just one listen.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.830
But she sure is ugly.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.290
I'm surprised that she got taken in here.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:25.340
The man who brought her here
was drop-dead gorgeous, I hear!

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.050
Oh my! Was he really?
I wish I could've seen him!

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.810
And that chaperone hag
was totally smitten!

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.690
You know what? I can tell.
That girl is to rise to the top.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.690
The grittiness to get back at the man
who abandoned her... I can sense it.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.320
A girl like that has a backbone.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.030
I-I see.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:56.200
You can have her clean the toilets or whatever!
Please, just take her!

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.830
Heck, I'd even give her away for free if I had to!

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.920
I'm going to make that guy pay!

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.720
I swear I'm going to become
the number one Oiran in Yoshiwara!

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.720
TOKITO HOUSE

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.100
Sumiko? Sumiko?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.400
Yes?

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.110
We're so short-staffed now.
Could you carry these up?

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.990
Understood!
I'll take them up right now!

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.410
Thanks! You're such a hard worker!

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.080
After we removed your makeup,
she found the scar on your forehead,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.960
so the madam was seething
with rage yesterday.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.170
Just stop it! It's no use
lashing out at this poor child!

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.920
Yes! I'm so glad
they're letting me work here!

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.050
Isn't she rather strong?

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.510
Strong.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.810
They're saying that Kyogoku House's madam
fell from a window and died.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.900
That's scary. Let's be careful, okay?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.910
A lot of the older girls are leaving
these days, committing Ashinuke.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.410
So scary!

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.580
What's Ashinuke?

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.830
That's a lot of baggage!

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.710
There!

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.380
They're all gifts for Koinatsu Oiran.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:27.090
Sumiko, you don't know?

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:32.970
Ashinuke means to run away from here
without paying off your debts.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.260
It's really bad if you get caught.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.350
Is that right?

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.310
Some people do manage
to run off with the man they love.

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.770
Right, like the other day, Suma Oiran...

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.730
Suma?

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.440
That's Uzui's wife.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.940
Um...

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.900
Stop spreading those rumors.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.200
After all, nobody knows
if she really did make it out of here.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.910
- Right.
- Right.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:00.870
So, you brought
these up for me?

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.120
Thank you.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.370
Um, right.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.420
Come here.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.170
Let me give you some candy.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.430
Eat it in secret by yourself, okay?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.180
I want some, too!

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.050
Oiran! Oiran!

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.060
No. You just had some, remember?

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.060
Um, did Suma Oiran commit Ashinuke?

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.070
Why would you ask a question like that?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.110
She has her guard up!

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.280
I have to find a way
to ask about Miss Suma.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.950
Um...

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.450
Candy.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.960
Suma Oiran is my...

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.710
She's my...

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.050
She's my...

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.760
older sister!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.350
TANJIRO IS SO HONEST THAT HE CAN'T ASSUME
A NORMAL EXPRESSION WHEN HE LIES

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.470
What?

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.350
So you were sold into the Entertainment
District after your sister?

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.480
Y-Yes.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.440
I've been exchanging letters
with my sister all this time,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.030
and I know she wouldn't commit Ashinuke.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.530
Is that right?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.330
True, I couldn't believe
that Suma would commit Ashinuke, either.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.630
She was such a grounded girl.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.510
There were no signs
that she was infatuated with any man.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.260
But they found her diary.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.010
And I hear that she'd written
about committing Ashinuke.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.220
Ashinuke...

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.640
How convenient is that for demons?

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.730
Even if someone were to vanish,
people would only assume that she'd run away.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.900
The diary was probably forged.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.650
I pray that you're safe.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.410
We're going to rescue you,
no matter what, Miss Suma!

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.420
All quiet today, too.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.260
I'm getting a really bad feeling.
It's like being enveloped in smoke.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.890
So adept at becoming invisible...

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:30.060
Could it be that the demon residing here
is an Upper Rank demon?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.600
If that's the case...

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:36.110
we could be in
for an ultra-flashy fight to the death.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.280
So hot! I'm dying to take these off!

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:46.120
Wearing this stupid outfit
blunts my senses like you wouldn't believe!

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.580
Oh, Yae! Do you have a minute?

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.580
Do you think Makio's all right?

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.170
Well, she's shut herself into her room
and won't come out,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.390
and all she said is that she wasn't feeling well,
but she won't go the hospital!

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.890
Sooner or later,
the madam's going to drag her out!

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.980
I just brought a meal to her.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.900
I only left it outside her door, but...

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.150
Makio? That's Uzui's wife.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.400
I finally heard her name mentioned.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.410
Not feeling well?
Like that would stop her from checking in?

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.910
That woman came
from that direction, huh?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:28.910
Guess I'll take a look.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.870
Oh, Inoko!

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.790
You'll hurt yourself if you rush like that!

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.420
What a quiet girl.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:47.220
You have a husky voice,
so don't ever say a word!

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.190
And you stink at falsetto, so everyone will know
right away that you're a guy. I'm not kidding.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.440
What am I supposed to do, dammit?

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:06.780
Now, then, answer me.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.450
Now, then, answer me.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.830
Who were you writing these letters to?

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.840
What was your name again?

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:26.010
Oh, that's right. It's Makio.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.350
Answer me, Makio.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:05.690
NIN-NIN

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:06.820
Nin-nin!

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.070
Huh?

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.070
It kills me to admit it,
but you're a stunner.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.450
What are you talking about?

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.160
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.660
In spite of himself, Zenitsu seems
to have taken a shine to the shamisen,

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.540
and he's become
quite a skilled player! Huh?

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.960
I'm scared to be alone in the house,
so is it okay if I come over?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.920
But I heard that they're really
doting on you over there.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.050
Is that right? Then I'm going to aspire to become
the number one Oiran in Yoshiwara, after all!

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.680
MIRROR

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.100
What happened?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.520
Next, Episode 3, "What Are You?"

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.180
Zenitsu, are you okay?

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.980
Zenitsu!

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.980
TO BE CONTINUED
