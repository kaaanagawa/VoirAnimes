00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.890
UPPER SIX

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.000
Please work!

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.670
Just for a second!

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.040
That way...

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.670
DESTROY

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.670
someone can behead him for sure!

EPISODE 9:
DEFEATING AN UPPER RANK DEMON

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.870
UZUI FAMILY GRAVE

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.140
If my siblings were still alive...

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.770
maybe we would've gone drinking one day.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.520
Sorry,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.230
but I still haven't managed to die yet.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.280
But I did bring some fine sake,
so cut me some slack.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.160
One day,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.530
we'll all drink together over there.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.840
Now, in their honor,
dig in and be as flashy as you can!

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.880
Whoa, these are tasty!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.010
Don't hold back, you three.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.850
Lord Tengen, do you...

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.140
Huh?

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.640
Lord Tengen, do you still think
about your deceased siblings?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.150
Sure.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.900
Not a day goes by
that I don't recall them.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.080
Even now, it seems like yesterday
that I left my homeland with you three.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.460
Hey, this one's tasty, too!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.250
Come on, join me!

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.090
Right.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.800
Delicious!

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.140
Hey! Would it kill you
to show some restraint?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.850
Now, now...

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.150
But Lord Tengen told us to dig in!

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.810
Here you go, Makio!

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.320
Delicious.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.740
Isn't it?

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.620
Someday, I'm going to Hell.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.910
Oh...

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.660
Whoops!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.660
I shouldn't have said that!

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.920
I don't need another tongue-lashing
from you three.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.260
I'm going to live the flashiest life possible.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.930
For my siblings' sake.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.350
With you three, that is.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.720
Right.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.610
How lovely.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.790
Th-Thank you very much.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.910
Sure.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.500
Lord Tengen! Lord Tengen!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.000
Me, too! Me, too!

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.630
You plastered them
on yourself, didn't you?

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.210
You're so cruel, Lord Tengen!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.840
Lord Tengen, would you mind
giving me that petal?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.350
I don't mind at all,
but there are tons of them everywhere.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.390
That's the one that I want.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520
Thank you very much.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.030
- Lord Tengen, I want one, too!
- Lord Tengen, I want one, too!

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.950
Huh?

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.450
Just pick up one of these petals yourselves!

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.490
- You're so cruel!
- You're so cruel!

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.710
Lord Tengen!

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.090
He regenerated his legs?

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.510
Dammit! He's already neutralized the poison!

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.100
Man, that sure packed a punch!

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.680
This poison, I mean!

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.940
Blood Demon Art...

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.940
Rotating Circular Slashes...
Flying Blood Scythes!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.240
Slashing us without even swinging his arms?

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.900
Over a wide range!

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.990
Sound Breathing...

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.250
Fourth Form...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.660
Constant Resounding Slashes!

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.340
He vanished?

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.760
Lord Tengen, behind you!

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.850
Hinatsuâ€”

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.230
I'll draw the Belts toward myself!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.650
Lord Tengen, don't mind me!

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.190
Go look for the demâ€”

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.320
Well, you have a lot of nerve.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.410
I'm sure going to mind you, you hear me?

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.490
Hinatsuru!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.580
Dammit!

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.790
The Belts are blocking me!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.380
Hinatsuru!

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.970
Wow!

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.550
It's so beautiful here,
isn't it, Lord Tengen?

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.640
I wish I could become a dragonfly
and soar like that!

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.310
Hey, that's a flashy dream
if I ever heard one!

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.270
There you go again, sounding like a fool!
For heaven's sake!

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.070
What? That's so not true!

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.940
I hate you, Makio!

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.860
What was that?
I dare you to say that again!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.920
Lord Tengen...

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.670
After defeating an Upper Rank demon...

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.090
let's withdraw from the front lines...

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.300
and live as ordinary people.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.760
Though we were raised as shinobi,

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.680
and though it won't bring back
the lives that we took...

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.940
we still need to set things right
somewhere along the line...

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.940
or else we can never hold our heads up
as long as we live.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.450
When that day comes,
all four of us might not be alive.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.200
But no hard feelings, all right?

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.710
Leave her alone!

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.300
Move!

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.420
Move, move, move!

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.640
Another person's about to be killed! Another
person's about to be killed before my eyes!

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.390
Close the distance! Jump!

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.680
Up on the roof!

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.980
You can't always be the one
under protection!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.310
Try to be even a little bit useful!

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.520
He doesn't see me as a threat!

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.820
That's because I'm weak!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.280
If I make an unpredictable move,
I can save her!

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.830
Use the kagura!

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.410
Hinokami Kagura's the answer!

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.410
I can reach her easy with that!

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.300
It's no good! I have no stamina!

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.710
I can't dig in!

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.470
What should I do? Hurry! Hurry!

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.680
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.930
Think! Think!

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.430
What's the most that I can do?

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.310
What is it that I can do right now?

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.920
Seriously, that was a lightning-fast move.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.380
There's no way
he can still move like that!

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.560
I did it! I did it!

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.600
Blend the breathing techniques!

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.560
Use Water Breathing
and the Hinokami Kagura in combination!

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.070
That'll give me more attack power
than I'd have with just Water Breathing,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.820
and I'll also be able to move longer
than with just the Hinokami Kagura!

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.950
I'm sure the swordsmen who've fought
the demons until now did just that.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.160
Taking the breathing techniques
and sword skills that suited them best,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.710
and modifying them into the form
that would allow them to exert maximum power!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.460
Because they racked their brains!

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.340
That's why so many different offshoots
have been created!

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.090
Modify it...

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.130
into any form.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.430
Be flexible!

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.140
That's the fighting style
that Urokodaki taught me!

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.020
Even if I can never fully master
Water Breathing like Tomioka has,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.900
I won't let what Urokodaki taught me...

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.530
go to waste!

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.570
Either way, you're going down!

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.370
Tanjiro Kamado!

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.170
You have my gratitude!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.980
UPPER SIX

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.690
Dammit!

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.610
These things are flapping around
like crazy! So annoying!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.610
Dammit! They're slithery,
but they're freaking hard!

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.780
They just keep coming!

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.290
Huh?

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.290
Dammit!

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.540
They're about to decapitate him!

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.920
Inosuke! Here comes
the next assault!

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.130
Crap! We can't bring this one down
unless we strike in tandem!

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.010
We're stirring things up as we flee,
so we're able to dodge her attacks somehow,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.270
but there's no point in just dodging!

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.680
We have to close the distance...

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.890
and go for her head!

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.780
Inosuke! Calm down!

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.450
There's absolutely no reason for us
to slash them at the same time!

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.960
We just need to make sure
the two demons' heads aren't connected!

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.670
Even after they behead their demon,
don't give up! Let's unleash our attack!

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.590
You...

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.300
Look at you!

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.560
Damn! You really are something else!

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.930
What's wrong?

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.230
Stay alert! Go for his head yourself!

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.310
I can do this!

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.690
Damn!

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.820
Won't budge!

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.410
The likes of you, cut off my head?

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.660
Never going to happen!

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.880
My blade's stuck!

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.310
Don't swing your head
all the way behind you!

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.060
Damn you!

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.480
Not that again!

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.060
Kamado! Hang on!

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.530
Uzui!

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.320
Lord Tengen!

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.450
Uzuiâ€”

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.280
Look out!

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.090
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.850
They're forcing us to change our strategy!

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.850
Muscle!

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.270
I can't close in on that worm woman,
no matter what!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:40.060
So the three of us will take her on while the old guy
deals with the praying mantis demon alone!

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.020
At least this one's weaker
than the man with the scythe!

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.940
Let's decapitate this one first!

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.110
Tanjiro, can you still move?

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.130
I can move!

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.090
But Uzui's been poisoned by the enemy,
so he's in bad shape!

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.510
We have to finish this
as soon as possible!

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.640
That was close! I barely blocked it!

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.850
He's attacking us even as he fights Uzui?

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.100
Hinatsuru!

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.560
Don't worry about me!

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.480
I'll go hide! Just focus on winning!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.860
Look out! Behind you!

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.740
Are you all right?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.490
Yes! Thank you!

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.170
I can see that your movements
are getting more and more sluggish!

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.420
I wonder which of you
will be the first to fall apart!

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.760
Dammit! Monichi and I
are practically unscathed!

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.680
We gotta take care of this!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.180
The other two are all banged up!

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.180
What was the point of all that training?

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.600
What was the point?

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.560
What was the point?

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.520
Inosuke!

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.030
This demon's neck is too soft to slash!

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.530
It's going to take a lot of speed!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.160
We'll have to slash her
from multiple directions, or it won't work!

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.870
Now that it's heading
toward Tanjiro, as well,

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:23.500
it seems like the attack's slightly...

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.630
ever so slightly slowed down!

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.300
It looks that way to me!

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.710
I'm just going to assume that it has!

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.060
All right!

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.020
If it's multiple directions you want,

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.560
just leave it to yours truly,
the dual-wielder, dammit!

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.900
The three of us together...

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.360
can beat her!

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.320
Gotcha!

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.450
Zenitsu, we're protecting Inosuke!

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.780
Okay!

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.540
Even if you bring
another ugly freak into the fray,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.870
it's not going to change anything!

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.170
Inosuke!

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.760
Let's go!

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.260
Don't be late, my underlings!

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.060
Beast Breathing...

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.860
Eighth Fang...

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.280
Explosive...

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.440
Rush!

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.290
Water Breathing...

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.790
Third Form!

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.250
Thunder Breathing...

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.050
First Form...

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.310
Flowing...

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.930
Thunderclap and Flash!

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:07.350
...Dance!

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.810
Eightfold!

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.330
He's...

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.580
He's only focusing on heading
straight toward me without any defense!

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.550
I'm getting it done this time!

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.760
You can't cut if off!

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.560
There's no way you can cut it off!

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.680
Not with these beat-up blades!

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.190
Sixth Fang...

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.950
Palisade Bite!

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.300
You did it, Inosuke!

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.170
Amazing! You used them like saws
to behead her!

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.090
Hah!

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.010
Her head! Her head! Her head!

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.930
I'm gonna race off with it somewhere
far away so she can't stick it back on!

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.530
For now, I'm gonna run
all over the place with this head, okay?

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.860
You two go help the old guy!

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.570
Gotcha!

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.200
Be careful, Inosuke!

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.160
Sure thing!

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.200
Uzui!

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.460
We have to join him right away!

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.220
You damn boar! You let me go!

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.230
Your attacks are pretty lame!

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.230
What did you say?

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:16.110
Maybe you can't die, but it sure looks
like you get weak once your head's cut off!

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.240
Inosuke!

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.410
Inosuke! Inosuke!

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.160
This is bad! The poison!

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.830
Where's the wound?
Was he stabbed in the heart?

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.500
It's so dark, I can't see!
Dammit! Dammit!

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.300
What's he doing here?

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.510
Where's Uzui?

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:42.260
Uzui!

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.520
Tanjiro! Look out!

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.100
Oh, damn!

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.230
Zenitsu...

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.360
Forget about me!

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.860
This happened
because I wasn't paying attention!

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.240
I'm sorry, Inosuke!

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.870
If only I'd noticed him sooner!

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.500
No... I...

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.880
If I hadn't left Uzui's side in the first place,
this wouldn't have happened!

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.000
Sorry.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.800
Sorry!

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.460
Sorry, everyone!

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.970
Sorry...

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.760
Nezuko.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.860
NIN-NIN

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.520
Nin-nin!

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.320
Beast Breathing, Eighth Fang...

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.900
Explosive Rush!

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.070
Thunder Breathing, First Form...

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.200
Thunderclap and Flash! Eightfold!

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.620
Water Breathing, Third Form...

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.200
Flowing Dance!

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.330
Inosuke!

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.250
Zenitsu!

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.880
Uzui!

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.590
We still can't win?

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.180
Don't give up!

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.010
Don't give up! Don't give up!

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.060
Next, Episode 10, "Never Give Up"!

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.980
