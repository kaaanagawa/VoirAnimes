00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.730
insult...

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.320

<i>It was way too easy.</i>

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.960
I can totally see why...

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.550
he ordered me to kill you,
the boy with the earrings,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
along with the Hashira!

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.230
Your very existence is, like...

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.560
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.320
<i>He's not dying?</i>

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.070
You want to know why I'm not dead
after you decapitated me, don't you?

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.580
It's because the body over there
was no longer my main body.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.080
While you were snoozing away...

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.330
I fused with this train!

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.340
Every inch of this train has become
my blood, my flesh and my bones!

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.890
So, do you think
you can protect them by yourself?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.100
All these people packing this train
from one end to the other...

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.940 line:20%
Can you alone keep me
from devouring them?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.120 line:20%
<i>The most I can protect on my own is two cars!</i>

<i>Any more than that,
and I can't guarantee their safety!</i>

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.290
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.670

It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.400 line:20%
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.160
This whole train's turned into a demon!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.410
Can you hear me?
This whole train is a demon!

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.960
I knew it!
So, I was right on the money!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.960
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.220
<i>Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...</i>

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.720
<i>Crazy Cutting!</i>

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.730
I'll save every last one of you guys!

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.810 line:20%
Fall onto your knees...

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.980
and worship me!

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.980
Glorify me!

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.320 line:20%
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.330
I have to go save the passengers!

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.160
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.690
It's gone this far already?

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.940
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.820

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.000 line:20%
<i>This is never going to end!</i>

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.330
<i>How am I supposed to fend it off?</i>

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.340
<i>Damn Demon Slayer,
scurrying around inside me.</i>

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.180
<i>You can cut all you want,
but I'll just keep regenerating.</i>

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.270
<i>And then, after all your strength is depleted...</i>

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.940 line:20%
<i>I'm going to partake of those
200 passengers in a leisurely feast.</i>

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.410
Nezuko!

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.790
Protect...

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.220
<i>That sounded like thunder.</i>

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.930
<i>From one of the cars in the back?</i>

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.890
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.760
<i>Is Zenitsu awake now?</i>

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.720
<i>What about Rengoku?</i>

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.020
<i>And Nezuko?</i>

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.690
<i>I cannot do anything
but protect the people here!</i>

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.030
<i>This is bad! What should I do?</i>

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.660
<i>We can't fight in coordination!</i>

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.910
<i>Are the passengers in the back all right?</i>

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.330
<i>Damn!</i>

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:41.200
<i>It's so cramped!</i>

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
<i>And so hard to swing my sword!</i>

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.760
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.090
How could this be?

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.010
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.430
If only I could crawl...

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.520
under a rock!

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.700
What happened?

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.240
<i>What was that?</i>

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.870
<i>A demon attack?</i>

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.670
Young Kamado!

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.670
Rengoku!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.380
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.010
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.600
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.510
Okay!

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.770
This train has eight cars in all.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.020
I'll protect the five in the rear.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.270
The yellow boy and your sister
will be in charge of the rest.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.150
You and the boar head boy...

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.400
will go look for the demon's head
while keeping an eye on those three cars.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.780
Head?

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.820
But this demon is—

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.620
No matter what form he's assumed,
so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.040
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.160
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.210
<i>Amazing! I can't even see him!</i>

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.590
<i>Did the train shake earlier
because Rengoku was on the move?</i>

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.090
<i>He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!</i>

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.350
<i>Five cars, all by himself?</i>

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.430
<i>This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!</i>

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.310
<i>The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!</i>

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.570
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.690 line:20%
Shut up, or I'll kill you!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.650 line:20%
Up there, huh?

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.870
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.830
But somehow...

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.830
Somehow...

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.580
Somehow, he was awesome!

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.420
I'm so pissed!

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.050
Inosuke! Keep an eye
on the three cars in the front!

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.880
You don't have to tell me!

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:00.300
And by the way, I've found it already!

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.300
With my all-out Seventh Form...

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.430
I found this master's weak spot!

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.850
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.350
That's right, up front!

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.190
And that front part
is a heck of a lot creepier!

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.190
<i>The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,</i>

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.530
<i>but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!</i>

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.070
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.110
That's right!

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.030
Understood!

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.160
Okay, let's go!

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.660

All right!

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.920

Fishy, very fishy!

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.550

G-Get out of here!

Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.570
That's way too many hands!

It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.510
Yeah, I know!

<i>It's regenerating so fast!</i>

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.460
<i>Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!</i>

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.540
<i>I have to sever it!</i>

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.380
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.130
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.850
Sounds good! Great idea!

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.390
I can praise you for that!

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.280
<i>I have to wake up with my eyes shut!</i>

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:39.960
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:41.460
<i>Cut the neck!</i>

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.460
<i>Cut it! Cut it!</i>

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.540
<i>I have to wake up!</i>

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.710
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.550 line:20%
<i>Wake up!</i>

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.390
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.890
Don't fall for his trap!

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.140
Don't die such lame deaths!

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.650
I'm wearing the hide
of the mountain god on my head.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.820
I bet he's too scared
to look me in the eye!

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.950
You loser eyeballs!

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.000
<i>I see. He's having a hard time
telling which way Inosuke's looking!</i>

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:25.080
All right, now all we gotta do
is slash this thing to death!

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.510
Inosuke!

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.880
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.430 line:20%
Did you get stabbed?

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.810 line:20%
I'm okay.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.270
Just forget about that bastard!

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.780
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.610
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.080
I know! Let's get moving!

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.590
Inosuke!

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.430
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.600
And let's chop off the demon's head!

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.180
Let's attack together!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.140
<i>No good! If I fall asleep now...</i>

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.640
Damn you!

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.140
C'mon! Follow me!

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.140
<i>Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...</i>

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.860
<i>Slice 'n' Dice!</i>

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.200
<i>Father, please protect me!</i>

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.280
<i>I'm going to sever that bone...</i>

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.830
<i>with this blow!</i>

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.960
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.630
<i>Clear Blue Sky!</i>

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.390
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.890
<i>I still haven't woken up from that dream?</i>

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.400
Huh?

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:07.160
Big Brother...

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.790
I will protect you!

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.160
Ne...

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.290
Ne...

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.550
Nezuko!

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.050
Nezuko!

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.590
<i>It was a dream?</i>

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.640
<i>Thank goodness!</i>

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.060
<i>Your sweet little chin looked like a butt!</i>

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.100
I almost forgot the preview!

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.440
Next, Episode 6, "Akaza"!

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.070
