00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.270

Even if you fight to the death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.190
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.520
But what about you?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.490
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs
and damaged internal organs...

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.700
All irreparable.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.160
If you were a demon,
you'd heal in the blink of an eye.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.580
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.790
You can struggle all you want,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.800
<i>But there's no strength in my arms or legs.</i>

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.890
<i>It's partly because of my injury,</i>

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.930
<i>but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!</i>

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.240
Kyojuro, why...

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.240
I...

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.660
I will fulfill my duty!

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.290 line:20%
I will not allow anyone here to die!

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.130

Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.650
That mental strength!

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.650
That airtight stance!

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.650 line:20%
You have to become a demon,
after all, Kyojuro!

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.910 line:20%

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.910

You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.920
Become a demon!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.930
Say that you'll become a demon!

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.180 line:20%
You are...

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.760 line:20%
strong and one of the chosen ones!

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.690
Kyojuro...

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.450
Yes, Mother?

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.490
I want you to think hard...

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.450
about what I'm about to ask you.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.080
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.340
I don't know!

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.840
So that you can save weaker people.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.430
Those who were born
blessed with more gifts than others

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.350
are obligated to use those gifts
for the world and other people.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:28.110
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.700
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.460
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.840
Make sure you never forget that.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.380
I won't!

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.110 line:20%
I don't have much more time to live.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.820 line:20%
I was blessed to be the mother
of such a strong and gentle child.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.910
I will entrust everything to you.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.800
<i>Mother...</i>

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.800
<i>It was an honor for me
to have been born to such a person as you!</i>

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.360 line:20%
<i>He stopped it?</i>

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.150
<i>What unbelievable strength!</i>

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.360
<i>I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!</i>

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.490
<i>Damn!</i>

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.740
<i>It'll be daybreak soon!</i>

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.660
<i>I have to kill him and get out of here!</i>

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.960
<i>I can't...</i>

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.710
<i>pull my arm out!</i>

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.710
<i>I won't let you escape!</i>

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.800
<i>No matter what Rengoku says...</i>

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.520
<i>I have to...</i>

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.230
<i>do it right now!</i>

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.520 line:20%
<i>I have to slice off the demon's head!</i>

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.940 line:20%
<i>Quickly!</i>

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.280
<i>The sun's coming up!</i>

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.030
<i>There'll be sunlight here!</i>

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.530
<i>I have to get away!</i>

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.530
<i>I have to get away!</i>

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.040 line:20%
<i>No way am I ever letting go!</i>

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.050
<i>Not until I chop off your head!</i>

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.220 line:20%
Out of my way!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.640
Move, Inosuke!

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.310
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.400

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.530

<i>I have to find refuge from the sunlight!</i>

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.020
<i>That took too long!</i>

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.190
<i>I have to get away from the sun!</i>

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.910
Don't run away!

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.330
Don't run away, you coward!

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.460 line:20%
Don't run away!

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.090
<i>What the hell is that brat talking about?</i>

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.710
<i>Doesn't he have a brain in his head?</i>

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.380 line:20%
<i>I'm not running away from you!</i>

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.970 line:20%
<i>I'm running away from the sun!</i>

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.220
<i>And besides,
the battle's already been decided!</i>

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.890
<i>He'll run out of strength and die soon!</i>

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.150
The Demon Slayer Corps...

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.690 line:20%
is always fighting you demons in the dark
of the night where you have the advantage!

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.820 line:20%
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.240
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.080
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.910 line:20%
Don't run away, you bastard!

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.670
You bastard! You coward!

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.250
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.960
He's stronger!

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.130
Rengoku didn't lose!

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.180
He didn't let anybody die!

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.800
He fought to the end!
He protected them to the end!

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.930
You're the one who lost!

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.140
It's Rengoku who won!

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.680
Stop yelling already.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.520
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.230
You're badly injured, too, remember?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.530
If you die, young Kamado,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.160
it'll mean I'm the loser.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.780
Rengoku...

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.250
Come over here.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.330

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.110
There's something that I remembered...

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.910
while I was dreaming.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.870
You should go to my parents' home,

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.000
the Rengoku residence.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.830 line:20%
There should be some notes there
left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.670
My father read them often,

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.130
but since I never did,
I don't know what's in them.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:15.270
There might be some kind of record
of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.860
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.230
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.530
Isn't there a way
to close up your wounds?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.490
No.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.160
I'll be dead soon.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.830
I'm going to tell you all I can
while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.920 line:20%
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.670 line:20%
to follow his heart...

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.590 line:20%
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.850
Tell my father...

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.810
that I want him to take care of himself.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.270
One more thing.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.610
Young Kamado...

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.360
I believe in your little sister.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.110
I accept her as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.660
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.380
Anyone who risks their lives
fighting demons to protect humans...

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.510
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.590
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.100
No matter how devastated you may be
by your own weakness or uselessness...

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.360 line:20%
set your heart ablaze.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.900
Grit your teeth
and look straight ahead.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.820
Even if you stop and crouch down,

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.120
time won't wait for you...

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.250
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.540
Don't feel bad
that I'm going to die here.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.420
As a Hashira,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.630
of course I would shield my juniors.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.340
Any other Hashira
would've done the same thing.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.140
We never let the young buds get nipped.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.390
Young Kamado...

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.020
Boar Head Boy...

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.310
Yellow Boy...

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.110
Keep learning and grow.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.400
And then,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.450
become the next Hashira
supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.790
I believe in you.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.040
I believe in you all.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.730
<i>Mother...</i>

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.740
<i>Do you think I did it right?</i>

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.370
<i>Did I carry out what I had to do...</i>

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.960
<i>and my duties?</i>

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.630
<i>You made me proud.</i>

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.260
When the train went off the rails,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.970
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:20.260
He must've kept the damage
to the cars to a minimum.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.810
I guess he did.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.610
I can't believe he's gone.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.900
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.400
Yeah.

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.530
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.030
Was it that strong? I mean...

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.580
Yeah.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.120
I'm so frustrated!

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.380
As soon as I master one thing,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.010
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:01.260
while more powerful people
are fighting far beyond it.

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.640
I just can't make it there yet!

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.610
If I'm still stumbling around
in a place like this, can I...

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.440
Can I...

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:18.950
ever become like Rengoku?

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.710 line:20%
Stop whining already!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.720
Stop saying dumbass things
like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.970
He said he believes in you, so just think
about how you're going to measure up to that!

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.730
All living things just go back
to the earth when they die!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.230
Sobbing or sniveling
won't bring them back!

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.980
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.610
No matter how pathetic
or humiliated you feel,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.990
you still have to go on living!

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.120
But you're crying, too.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.620
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm not crying!

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.890
Get over here!
We're gonna train!

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.600
Is that so...

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.930
Rengoku...

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.710
So, even Rengoku couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:40.760
I don't believe it.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.850
Namu Amida Butsu.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.690
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.790
I see.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.470
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.510
Kyojuro did a great job, then.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.430
What a remarkable child.

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.680
I'm not sad.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.270
I don't have much longer to live, either.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.190 line:20%
Soon, I'll be joining
Kyojuro and the others

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.570 line:20%
in the land of the dead.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.750 line:20%
Rengoku...

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.750 line:20%
Rengoku...

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.510
Rengoku!
