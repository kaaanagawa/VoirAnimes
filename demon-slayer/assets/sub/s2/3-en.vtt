To be able to die while dreaming...

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.230
Just how lucky are you?

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.740
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.910
A human's driving force

All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.130
You can kill them just like that!

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.090
All human hearts are the same.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.300
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.560
You are falling...

You are falling...

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.270
into a dream.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.200

This way!

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.580
The peaches over here taste great!

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.000
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.080
I'll make you a chaplet!

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.500
I can make these really great-looking ones...

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.170
Nezuko!

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.840
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.220
Zenitsu?

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.520
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.770
River?

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.020
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.780
I can't swim.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.780
I-I'll just carry you on my back
and jump right over the river!

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.790
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.290
Just leave it to me!

Here he is!

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.090
All right, let's go! Showdown!

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.970
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.550
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.810
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.890
Let's go!

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.150
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.590
<i>Why did I come here?</i>

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.220
<i>Oh, right.</i>

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.730
<i>To report to my father...</i>

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.600
<i>that I've become a Hashira.</i>

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.330
So what if you've become a Hashira?

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.130
Worthless.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.800
It means nothing.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.800
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.100
Neither you...

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.310
nor I.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.730
Brother...

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.780
Was our father pleased to hear your news?

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.030
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.250
<i>He wasn't always like that.</i>

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.670
<i>After all, he did rise to the rank of Hashira
in the Demon Slayer Corps.</i>

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.550
<i>He was a passionate man.</i>

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.890
<i>And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.</i>

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.260
<i>Suddenly.</i>

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.730
<i>The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...</i>

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.770
<i>Why?</i>

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.740
<i>It's pointless to think
about such things, so stop.</i>

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.990
<i>Senjuro is even worse off.</i>

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.830
<i>He barely has any memories of our mother
who died of illness when he was very young,</i>

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.250
<i>and just look at the state our father is in.</i>

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.840
I'm going to be honest.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.380
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.970
He told me that it meant nothing.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.310
But that's not enough
to extinguish my passion!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.480
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.480
I'll never give in!

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.480
And Senjuro...

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.240
You're not like me.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.700
You have a big brother...

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.740
who believes in his little brother.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.580
No matter what path you take,
you're going to become a fine human being!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.340
Let's do our best!

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.550
Let's do our best and live on!

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.880
No matter how lonely it gets.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.430
Looking good.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.890
Those ropes that I created are used

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.310
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.650
I always fight with the utmost caution.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:37.120
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:43.370
I'll enjoy the feast
after killing the Demon Slayers.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.920
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.180
Relax your shoulders.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.720
Like this?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.010
That's right.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.930
Close call. He's right there.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.980
<i>I have to make sure he doesn't see me!</i>

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.570
<i>I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!</i>

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.480
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.700
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.870
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:47.980
There it is!

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.480
The scenery doesn't end here,
but I can't go any further.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.820
<i>I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!</i>

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.620
<i>And then, I'll get to see
a happy dream myself!</i>

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.720
<i>What an odd realm of the subconscious.</i>

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.430
<i>It's hot.</i>

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.970
<i>It's burning up.</i>

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.260
<i>I have to hurry.</i>

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.160
Found it!

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.870
The spiritual core!

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.330
I've never seen a red one before.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.380
All I have to do is destroy this and...

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.170
it'll be my turn to...

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.120
<i>I thought humans couldn't move
while they were under a spell.</i>

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.960
<i>What a strong survival instinct he has!</i>

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.380
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.050
Wow!

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.430
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.930
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.650
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.110
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.070
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.070
Can you get the grill ready for me?

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.610
Okay!

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.950
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.580
Okay, I'll be in charge
of flipping them over, then!

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.410
Me, too!

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.750

Big Sis went up the mountain

Huh? It's gone.

I wonder what that was
for just a split second.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.560
A toolbox perhaps?

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.190

Big Bro, are you all right?

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.810
Big Bro?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.850
Sorry.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.560
I have to go.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.440
<i>I have to hurry back!</i>

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.400
I'm sorry.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.820
Big Bro!

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.570
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.790
<i>If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...</i>

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:06.750
<i>I have to find him
and slash him right away!</i>

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.800
<i>Where is he? I have to...</i>

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.340
Where are you going, Big Bro?

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:26.230
I picked lots of vegetables today!

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.400
Mom! This way!

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.400
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.740
Mom?

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.500
Tanjiro, are you all right?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.870
Big Bro...

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.420
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.480
I wish I could stay here...

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.270
forever.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.860
<i>I wish I could turn around and go back.</i>

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.280
<i>By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.</i>

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.240
<i>Right here.</i>

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.330
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.630
<i>they'd all have been alive and well now.</i>

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.840
<i>And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.</i>

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.260
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.100
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.600
<i>I should be here
making charcoal every day.</i>

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.230
<i>I never would've laid a hand on a sword!</i>

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.030
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.990
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.750
<i>But I've lost them now.</i>

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.960
<i>I can never go back!</i>

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.890
Big Bro!

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.890
Don't leave us behind!

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.310
<i>Sorry!</i>

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.110
<i>I'm sorry, Rokuta!</i>

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.570
<i>We can't be together anymore.</i>

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:45.030
<i>But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?</i>

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.790
<i>I'll be thinking of you all!</i>

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.670
<i>There are lots of things to thank you for.</i>

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.960
<i>Lots of things to be sorry for!</i>

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.760
<i>But I will never forget you!</i>

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.090
<i>No matter what,
my heart will always be with you!</i>

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:06.100
<i>So, please...</i>

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.600
<i>forgive me!</i>

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.280
I have to destroy
his spiritual core right away.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.010
<i>So, this is the inside of his heart?</i>

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:46.510
<i>How can it be so beautiful?</i>

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.010
<i>It's so endlessly vast...</i>

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.980
<i>and...</i>

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.770
<i>also warm.</i>

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.320
They're having trouble, aren't they?

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.190
I wonder why.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.320
They haven't destroyed
any of the spiritual cores yet.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.580
Oh well...

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.080
I guess it doesn't matter,
since they're buying me some time.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.090
<i>Not here.</i>

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.010
<i>But I can smell a demon, faintly.</i>

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.010
<i>What's this, though?</i>

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.090
<i>It's like there's a film over everything!</i>

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.970
<i>There's a faint demon scent everywhere!</i>

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.100
<i>I can't tell the exact location!</i>

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.140
I have to hurry!

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.730
Nezuko's bleeding!

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.860
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.860
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.910
<i>Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?</i>

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.370
<i>Am I just asleep right now?</i>

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.620
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.840
Take up your sword.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.670
There's something you must cut.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.810
<i>There's something...</i>

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.310
<i>I must cut.</i>

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.780
<i>There's something I must cut...</i>

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.820
<i>in order to wake up.</i>

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.450
<i>I think I know what it is.</i>

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.870
<i>But what if I'm wrong?</i>

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.960
<i>If what happens in this dream
has an effect on reality, too...</i>

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.170
<i>there'll be no going back.</i>

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.960
<i>Don't hesitate! Do it!</i>

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.590
<i>You have to do it!</i>

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.880
<i>My death in this dream
will lead me to reality!</i>

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.180
<i>In other words...</i>

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.300
<i>what I have to cut is...</i>

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.310
<i>my own neck!</i>

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.040
Good job preparing yourself for all this.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.910
It's because of what you always told me.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.380
Even if you're in anguish,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.300
try to be a graceful and strong person
who can feel love for other humans.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.680
All those people suffering at the hands
of the demons... Nezuko... Take care of them...

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:56.140
Tanjiro.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.810
I'm going to give it my all, Father!

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.810
Next, Episode 4, "Insult."
