WEBVTT

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.900
Kamado!

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.910
Kamado! Get up! It's not over yet!

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.910
What?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.450
He's saying something.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.660
His head...

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.620
Did I fail to cut it off after all?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.880
Run! This isn't over yet!

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000
Uzui is...

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.130
saying something.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.010
Run!

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.410
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.380
EPISODE 11:
NO MATTER HOW MANY LIVES

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.350
Nezuko...

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.450
So awful.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.040
The whole place is wrecked.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.420
You were the one who saved me, Nezuko?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.800
Thanks!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.590
Wait!

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.010
What about the others?

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.760
I can't...

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.680
move my body!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.150
No. Why am I able to move at all?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.060
Why am I alive?

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940
After being poisoned!

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.610
Tanjiro!

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.740
That sounds like Zenitsu!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.870
Tanjiro!

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.990
Help me!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.790
Tanjiro!

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.540
I woke up, and my body hurts all over!

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.760
Both my legs! Are they broken?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.430
What's going on?
Who did this to me, huh?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.550
It really hurts!
I'm too scared to look!

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.510
You're okay, then? Thank goodness!

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.060
I am anything but okay!

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.310
Not that I don't deserve pity, too,
but Inosuke's in bad shape!

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.940
The sound of his heartbeat
is getting fainter and fainter!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.360
Inosuke! Where is he?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.860
Over there! He's over there!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.790
Inosuke!

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.830
Inosuke! Inosuke, stay with me!

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.250
Inosuke!

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.760
I can hear his heart growing weaker!

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.550
I have to neutralize the poison!

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.300
I know! What about sunlight?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.680
Daybreak's still a ways off.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.930
What should I do? What should I do?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.350
Send a crow to Lady Shinobu?
No, there's not enough time!

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.940
If I don't do something right now,
Inosuke's going to die!

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.110
Why was my life spared?

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.740
Why was I the only one?

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.080
His skin, inflamed by the poison...

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.960
It's starting to heal!

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.300
I'm starving! Gimme something to eat!

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.550
Inosuke!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.680
Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.970
Knock it off! You're creeping me out!

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.350
Nooooo!

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.070
Please don't die!
Please don't die on us, Lord Tengen!

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.030
Not after you managed to survive!

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.820
Not after you won!
I can't take it! I can't take it!

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.330
How are we supposed
to deal with demon poison?

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.950
The antidote's not working!

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.870
The gods are so cruel!

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.210
So cruel!

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.130
I have some last words to leave you.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.840
My life until nowâ€”

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.390
If you let Lord Tengen die,
I'm never going to pray to you again!

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.730
No way will I ever forgive you,
you hear me?

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.520
Come on, shut the hell up!

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.980
Can't you hear Lord Tengen talking?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.110
I'm so going to stuff your mouth
with rocks, you moron!

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.990
Both of you, quiet down!

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.740
Makio's tormenting me!

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.580
Shut up, dumbass!

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.580
You're kidding me, right?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.960
Am I going to die
without getting to say my last words?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.960
You really put them in my mouth!

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.000
Listen, cut it out, I said!

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.830
The poison's making my tongue stiff.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.380
Cut it out!

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.210
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.510
Don't spit them out!

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.420
I still could've left those last words, but...

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.380
Seriously?

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.390
What?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.310
Hey!

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.730
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you, anyway?

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.610
It's way too soon
to be cremating him!

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.490
How can you burn him already
when he's not even dead yet?

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.030
I'm going to spank you!
I'm very angry with you, young lady!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.410
Hold up a second!

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.370
Huh?

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.950
How do you explain this?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.460
The poison's left my body!

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.210
Lord Tengen!

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.720
I'm so relieved! Truly!

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.640
You three...

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.850
Sorry to make you worry.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.110
I think that Nezuko's Blood Demon Art
ignited the poison, burning it away.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.860
Not that I'm really sure how it works.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.990
But please stay still,
or your wounds won't heal.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.330
I'm so glad that you survived.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.910
How can this even be possible?

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.540
It's all so confusing.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.040
Thank you!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.500
Hey, you better not move either,
or you'll die!

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.920
Thank you!

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.460
I'm going to go search
for the demons' heads.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.920
I can't rest easy until I find them.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.850
Nezuko! That way!
I can smell demon blood!

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.560
Is that a pool of blood?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.690
Demon blood?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.120
All right! It won't be attacking anymore.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.710
I was able to collect
the blood of an Upper Rank demon!

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.340
Take this to Miss Tamayo.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.970
I'm counting on you!

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.980
There's no one in sight.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.230
So Makio and the others
managed to evacuate everyone.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.610
That's a relief!

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.780
Nezuko! This way!

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.450
I want you to head this way!

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.450
The demon scent is getting stronger.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.250
Who the hell gets beheaded
by those two bottom-feeders?

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.340
So you were watching after all!

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.840
Why didn't you save me, then?

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.010
I was battling a Hashira, you know!

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.850
So what if you were?
Why didn't you finish him off?

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.180
You could've just split
his head into two!

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.520
I was about to do that!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.270
Huh?

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.730
But that kid with the earrings was still alive,
so I was going to kill him off first!

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:14.150
Since you didn't do a damn thing yourself,
you could've at least finished off the Hashira!

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.950
Then you should've controlled me
so that I could do that!

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:21.410
UPPER SIX

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.410
But you did nothing!
You let your guard down!

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.450
You shut up!

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.620
They're still alive.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.580
Look, if you're going to call
yourself an Upper Rank,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.580
Not only that, but they're arguing!

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.630
then you should at least be able to take down
two wounded low-level scrubs yourself, idiot!

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.630
But it looks like their bodies
are starting to disintegrate.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.050
Hey, you're the idiot!

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.130
What did you say?

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.520
No one as ugly as you...

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.640
could possibly be my brother!

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.730
I bet you and I...

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.530
aren't even related by blood!

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.530
Since we look nothing alike!

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.860
You're so useless!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.410
Your one saving grace is your strength!

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.780
Nothing else!

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.000
You have no value at all if you lose!

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.370
You worthless, ugly freak!

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:12.840
UPPER SIX

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.760
Don't give me that crap!

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.220
If you were on your own,
you'd be long dead by now!

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.970
How many times have I saved you?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.760
You're the worthless one, and you know it!

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.980
You're weak,
and you have no value whatsoever!

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.110
I wish I hadn't protected
someone like you all this time!

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.150
If it hadn't been for you,
my life would've been different!

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.070
Right, if it hadn't been for you!

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.910
Why do I always have to clean up your messes?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.160
You just never should've been bornâ€”

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.790
That's a lie.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.800
You don't really feel that way at all.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.590
You don't mean any of that.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.760
Try to get along.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.810
In this whole world, you two siblings
have no one but each other.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.850
There's no one who'll forgive you
for what you did.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.150
You'll be resented, despised
and denounced by all those you've killed.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.860
Nobody will ever be on your side.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.490
So if nothing else, you two...

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.830
shouldn't be cursing each other out like this!

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.090
Why don't you shut up?

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.260
Don't you dare lecture us!

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.140
You stupid brat!

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.470
Get out of here! Just get lost!

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.310
I'm so pissed!

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.850
I'm so pissed!

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.860
Fix this somehow, Brother!

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.490
I don't want to die, Brother!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.910
Brother!

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.160
Broâ€”

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.620
Ume!

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.790
That's right.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.250
My little sister's name was Ume.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.290
Not Daki.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.840
What a god-awful name.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.140
No.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.060
Ume was pretty bad, too.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:37.900
Since you were named
after the disease that killed our mother.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.150
The Rashomon Riverbank.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.700
We were born into the lowest class
of the Entertainment District.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:50.410
Children were seen as extra mouths to feed,
so we were cursed for just living.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.670
My mother nearly killed me more than once
before I was even born.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:00.920
And she also tried to kill me numerous times
after I was born, since I was nothing but a burden.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.920
And yet, I still survived.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:10.180
My body was weak like a withered leaf,
but I clung to life as hard as I could.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.730
Worm! Dimwit!

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.440
Sad sack! Coward! Good-for-nothing!

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.900
I was mocked
for my ugly voice and appearance,

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.320
and rocks were thrown at me
for being filthy.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:32.330
It was as if all of the abuse and insults
in the world were created just for me.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:37.210
Not only was I ugly, but I was filthy, too.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.460
Always covered in grime
and dandruff from head to toe.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.760
Giving off the stench of fleas.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.390
I was especially despised
in the Entertainment District,

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.600
where beauty was the measure of your value.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.770
As if I were a monster.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.520
When I got hungry, I ate mice and insects.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.900
My only toy was a scythe
that a customer had left behind.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.660
Things started to change for me...

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.870
after Ume was born.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.170
Ume...

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.920
You were my pride and joy.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:28.800
Even at a tender age, grown-ups would reel
at the sight of your beautiful face.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.680
I discovered that I was good at fighting

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.350
and started working as a debt collector.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:41.360
I revolted everyone, and they all feared me.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.860
That made me feel so good.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.030
My ugliness became a source of pride...

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:58.250
and having a gorgeous sister like you
dispelled my sense of inferiority.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.000
I had the feeling...

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.510
that we were on the fast track
to a better life.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.270
Until you turned thirteen, Ume.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.160
Because you stabbed a customer,
a samurai's eye with a hairpin, blinding him,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.870
you were bound hand and foot
out of retaliation and then burned alive.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.620
I wasn't there.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.710
I got home from work
to find you burnt to a crisp.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.560
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.060
Don't collect from me!

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:05.560
You're collecting from me
after never giving me a damn thing?

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.940
I'll never forgive you!

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.030
I'll never forgive you!

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.950
Turn my sister back the way she was!

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.280
Or else...

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.540
I'll kill the gods, Buddha, every one of you!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.710
You're sure he's the one?

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.960
Yes! That's him all right!

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.260
I appreciate this!
I'm so glad to be rid of that troublemaker!

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.510
He was such a savage!

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.640
Severely injuring the people
he was collecting from!

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.520
And lately, he's really been out of control!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.980
It's a shame that we lost Ume,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.230
but when I find another pretty girl,
I'll send her your way.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.780
So, um, about the money...

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.900
Hold on.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.280
After I finish him off.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.000
Hey you...

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.050
That's a fine kimono
you're wearing, huh?

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.680
You're clean,
and you have a good complexion.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.470
I bet you always have plenty to eat,
and you sleep in a nice, clean bed.

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.520
I bet that's all you've ever known.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.530
Living in a house that shelters you
from the rain and wind.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.570
Lucky you.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.240
Lucky you!

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:45.250
A guy who has it so good
doesn't get to make such a racket.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.420
Sniveling and moaning...

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.800
...over one measly eyeball.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.600
No one would help us.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.520
No surprises there.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.690
That was just the story of our lives.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.200
No one ever offered us a helping hand.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.580
It started snowing.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:31.000
We were never shown the slightest mercy,
no matter what the situation.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.300
Why was that?

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.720
What happened to
"fortune and misfortune are intertwined"?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.180
Both fortune and misfortune
should come by turns!

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.190
Hey, what's the matter?

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.110
You poor things.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.820
I happen to be kindhearted,
so I can't look the other way.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:02.160
That girl is probably going to die
any minute now.

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:13.590
UPPER SIX

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.000
I'll give you some blood!

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.870
Both of you!

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.000
If he chooses you,
you can become demons.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:19.470
Life is a sacred thing.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.760
You should treasure it.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.010
Now then...

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.980
can you become demons...

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.230
a Twelve Kizuki like me...

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.530
UPPER SIX

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.940
and rise up to the Upper Ranks, I wonder.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.700
I don't regret becoming a demon.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:48.200
No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'm going to be a demon every time.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.420
I'll never show mercy to anyone
who has a better life.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.340
I'll always be the Gyutaro who seizes and collects!

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.260
But...

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:03.300
if I did have one regret,
that would be...

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.850
Ume...

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.480
You might've turned out
differently than me.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:19.440
If you'd worked at a better House,
you could've become a respectable Oiran.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:26.700
If you'd been born to normal parents,
you could've been a normal girl.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.290
If you'd been born into a good family,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.210
maybe you would've become
a well-bred young lady.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.720
Since you have
such an impressionable, pliant nature.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.390
Maybe you only turned out this way
because I was the one who raised you.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.350
"Take before someone takes from you."

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.270
I taught you to collect from others,

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.650
and that's why you stabbed
that samurai in the eye.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.610
But if you'd done as he said,

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.990
you might've followed a different path.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.500
My only regret...

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.960
I guess it was you.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.260
What is this place?

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
Is this Hell?

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.520
Brother!

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.020
It's awful here!
I don't like this place!

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.610
Where are we?

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.360
I want to leave! Do something!

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.900
You...

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.820
Look at you.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.830
Is the exit that way?

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.960
Listen.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.710
Don't follow me anymore.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.960
B-But why?

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.460
Wait, Iâ€”

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.510
I said don't follow me!

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.760
Are you mad about what I said?
I'll apologize! So forgive me!

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.180
I don't think you're ugly, Brother!

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.390
I was just bitter!
I was bitter because we'd lost!

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.150
I didn't want to admit
that we'd lost because of me!

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.400
I'm sorry! For not fighting better!

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.780
If only I could've been more useful,
then we wouldn't have lost!

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.160
I'm sorry I'm always dragging you down!

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.960
Listen, Brother!

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.170
You're not my sister anymore.
You're nothing to me.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.930
I'm heading this way,

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:51.760
so you go in the opposite direction,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.430
toward the light.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.270
Hey!

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.360
No!

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:02.900
No!

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.240
I'm not leaving you!
I'm never going to leave you, okay?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.410
We're always going to be together!

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.780
No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'm always going to be your little sister!

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.660
No matter what!

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.330
Please don't hate me!

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.830
Don't scold me!

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.210
Don't leave me all by myself!

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.420
I'll never forgive you
if you leave me behind!

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.720
Because we're always going to be together!

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.560
How could you? How could you?

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.730
Don't you remember
that promise we made?

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.070
Have you forgotten?

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.740
The two of us together can't be beat!

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.870
Being cold or hungry
doesn't bother us at all!

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:03.790
I promise you!
We're always going to be together!

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.130
I'm never going to leave you!

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.090
See?

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.550
You're not afraid
of anything now, are you?

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.520
I wonder if they made up.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.700
It's over, huh?

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.990
I'm exhausted.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:22.710
I see.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.710
Six, huh?

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:30.420
That would be the lowest
of the Upper Ranks.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.050
Well, Six or not,
you still defeated an Upper Rank,

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.180
so yes, congratulations are in order.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.430
Right, Six or not.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.640
I don't mind offering you my praise.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.900
Well, not that your praise
will do anything for me.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.190
That's right!

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:48.980
You sure took your time getting here!

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.690
Y-Y-You took too long to get here!

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.530
Way too long!

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.160
Scary!

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.450
What are you going to do
now that you've lost your left hand and left eye?

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:06.040
How long will it take you to return to duty
after battling this lowly Upper Six?

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.290
Who's going to fill in for you until then?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.960
I'm retiring.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.380
There's just no way I can still fight.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.680
I'm sure the Master will accept that.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.640
Don't be ridiculous.
I refuse to accept it.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.350
As it is, too many of the youngsters
are dying on us before reaching their potential.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:29.360
There's still a vacant Hashira spot
now that Rengoku's gone.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.940
Even someone as uninspiring as you
would be better than nothing at all.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:34.940
Battle on until you die.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.700
Nope, there is a youngster
who's about to reach his potential for sure.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.950
That young guy you hate.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.620
Hey...

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.580
No way.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.750
Then, he survived?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.170
This battle?

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.840
That Tanjiro Kamado?

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.560
Is that right?

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:09.020
They defeated it? An Upper Rank?

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:16.530
Good job, Tengen,
Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke!

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.660
Master Kagaya...

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.280
For a hundred years...

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.950
For a hundred years,
nothing had changed!

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.790
But now it has!

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.670
Amane...

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.630
Yes?

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.050
Do you see?

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.920
This is an omen!

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.930
Fate is about to take a dramatic turn!

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.850
The consequences will be widespread!

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.930
Sweeping up everything around them,
shaking them to their core!

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.440
And eventually, they will reach that man.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:56.900
Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:03.030
We will defeat you without fail
during our generation!

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.450
You, the sole blemish on my family!

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.080
Children, go boil some water!

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.210
And fetch his medicine and some towels!

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.500
Hurry!

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.590
Father!

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.590
- Father!
- Father!

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:25.930
UPPER

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.730
The alternate dimension.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.270
The Infinity Castle.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.070
The fact that I was summoned here means...

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.990
UPPER THREE

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.990
that an Upper Rank was killed
by the Demon Slayers!

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.830
Oh, damn! This hurts like hell!

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:59.590
But thank goodness, Lord Tengen!

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.380
Really.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.590
Thank goodness you're alive.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:09.970
So, it'll be all four of us
returning intact, right?

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.270
Yeah. Let's go home to a hero's welcome.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.810
And be flashy about it!

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.110
Thank goodness!

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.610
- We're alive!
- Yeah! Yeah!

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.290
You guys...

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.750
I'm so glad you're alive!

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.920
THE END
