DESTROY

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.730
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.980
Tanjiro! Look out!

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.570
Oh, damn!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.990
Zenitsu...

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.820
Forget about me!

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.330
This happened
because I wasn't paying attention!

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210
I'm sorry, Inosuke!

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.330
If only I'd noticed him sooner!

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.840
No... I...

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.340
If I hadn't left Uzui's side in the first place,
this wouldn't have happened!

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.430
Sorry.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.970
Sorry!

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.970
Sorry, everyone!

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.990
EPISODE 10:
NEVER GIVE UP

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.040
Sorry.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.450
Sorry, everyone.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.880
Sorry...

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.500
Nezuko.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.430
Don't apologize, Big Bro.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.560
Big Bro, why are you always apologizing?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.440
If we're poor,
does that make us unhappy?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.060
If we can't wear pretty kimonos,
should people pity us?

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.230
Are you so determined to blame someone?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.570
You think it was our father's fault
for dying of illness.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.780
He tried as hard as he could,
and it wasn't enough,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.580
so we just have to accept that!

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.460
We're humans, after all, so none of us
can expect everything to go our way.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.670
Whether you're happy or not is up to you.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.380
The important thing is now.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.090
Let's just look ahead.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.300
Let's try harder together!

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.850
Let's fight!

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.180
Stop apologizing!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.230
You of all people should understand!

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.650
I want you to understand how I feel!

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.950
Was that a dream about the past?

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.290
Huh? Where am I?

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.460
I...

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.010
This is awful.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.810
I can't believe it ended up like this.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.520
Were the people who live here
able to escape?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.270
Where's Nezuko?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.110
Nezuko...

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.190
Thanks, Nezuko.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.950
I have to do what I can do!

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.870
UPPER SIX

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.870
What's this? You're still alive?

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.750
You're one lucky guy, huh?

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.300
Well, not that you have anything
going for you except for being lucky.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.220
I feel sorry for you!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.060
Everyone but you is probably done for!

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.560
A single thrust to that boar's heart.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.980
That towheaded boy's trapped
under the rubble, and he's flailing,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.610
so I'm just going to leave him there
until he dies.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.070
Squirming like an insect...
How disgraceful is that!

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.040
And how weak was that Hashira!
All he had was bluster!

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.080
The poison got to him, stopping his heart,
and now he's dead! It's all over for him!

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.840
So disgraceful! So disgraceful!

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.550
You four are truly disgraceful!

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.180
Especially you!
You're in another league!

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.310
The one sticking out of that box
you carry is a relative, right?

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.190
I can tell that she's closely related to you
even if she's a demon now.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.320
Is she your older or younger sister?

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.700
Why won't he kill me?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.120
What is this?

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.370
My arm is numb!

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.700
I still have no strength!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.120
Even if I went for his head now,
I couldn't slash it.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.290
Nezuko...

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.460
is my younger sister.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.680
Just as I thought!
You really are a disgrace!

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.350
You're not protecting
your little sister at all!

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.980
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.110
Since you're a human
and your sister's a demon.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.110
Of course you're weaker
than your demon sister.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.370
Even so, what a disgrace!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.580
If you're her big bro,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.620
instead of being protected by your little sister,
you should be protecting her!

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.050
Devotedly. With this hand, see?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.430
Hey, listen!
How do you feel now?

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.470
Being the only one
to survive so disgracefully!

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.020
That little sister you rely on
has all but used up her strength!

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.860
Hey, worm! Dimwit!

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.150
Sad sack! Coward! Good-for-nothing!

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.620
Why were you even born, huh?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.280
What are you gonna do?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.750
With your weak sauce, battered, disgraceful
human body! Let's see you cut off my head!

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.420
Come on! Come on!

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.050
Come on!

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.940
Huh?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.610
UPPER SIX

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.240
I see! Your soul got crushed
at the last minute, huh?

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.570
How disgraceful are you!

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.080
You're disgraceful as all get-out!

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.890
So disgraceful.
You really are one disgraceful guy.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.980
I've never seen anyone
as disgraceful as you.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.840
As disgraceful as you are,
I don't dislike you.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:09:00.850
Because I like anything
that's pathetic, disgraceful and filthy!

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.810
This filthy scar on your forehead!

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.520
I like it! I think I'm getting attached to it!

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.530
I know! Why don't you
become a demon, too?

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.360
For your little sister's sake, as well!

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.030
That's it! That's it!
What a great idea!

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.450
If you become a demon,
I'll spare your life!

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.540
Because we'll be friends!

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.370
Otherwise, I'll slaughter your sister, too.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.630
Since I really don't give a crap
about other people's little sisters.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.970
No way! You'd better not, Brother!
I'm so not on board with that, all right?

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.720
If you become a demon,
you can become stronger, just like that!

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.850
You can kiss that defective
physical body goodbye!

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.230
Hey! Hey!

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.390
What's it gonna be?

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.940
Your own weakness
makes you bitter, doesn't it?

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.320
When humans grieve,
they look up to the sky.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.990
You know, so their tears don't overflow.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.250
I...

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.080
I...

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.670
I was waiting for this moment!

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:19.130
A last-ditch head-butt, huh?
That had zero effect on me!

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.010
M-M-My body won't...

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.980
Brother, what are you doing?
Get on your feet!

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.980
Something's wrong!
What's going on? Something's wrong!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.480
It was nothing
but a lame human head-butt!

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.780
A Kunai! I got stabbed
when he head-butted me!

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.950
This brat was pretending to run away
when he was really going for this Kunai!

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.420
Scattering the Courtesans' sachets
along with the rubble

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.290
to cover up the scent
of the Kunai's poison!

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.460
Damn you! Damn you!

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.300
You're a weakling!
A stinking human!

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.850
Look how beat-up you are after I rubbed
my superior strength in your face!

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.850
Why won't you give up
when you're on your own?

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.350
Why won't you cave in?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.270
The will to bring me down...

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.110
Why is it so unswerving?

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:24.990
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.000
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.750
...Bro! Big Bro!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.710
Big Bro!

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.720
Big Bro!

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.640
Brother!

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.310
At every turn, one false step,

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.440
and I could've found myself
in that same situation.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.860
I was lucky enough to remain a human,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.330
but there could've been a future
in which we were both demons.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.580
But even if I end up
turning into a demon, I'm sure...

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:17.750
that someone in the Demon Slayer Corps

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.220
will do me the favor of beheading me.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.930
Cut through! Cut through!

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.560
Win! Win, no matter what!

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.650
We're going to win!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.400
Hey! Are you kidding me?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.900
Don't get beheaded
by someone like him!

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.250
Damn him! He pulled himself
out of the rubble!

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.500
Out of my way, ugly freak!

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.130
Thunder Breathing...

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.510
First Form...

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.970
I know how fast your move is!
I've seen it so many times!

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.300
Thunderclap and Flash...

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.010
Godlike Speed!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.190
So fast!

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.110
M-My head's being severed!

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.530
Damn!

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.280
I didn't think he could move like this!

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.240
Cut through! Cut through!

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.280
Follow through!

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.490
I can only use Thunderclap and Flash Godlike Speed
twice! It saps the strength from my legs!

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.080
I've already used it once to escape
the rubble, so this is my last chance!

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.000
And I won't get another chance
to go for her neck if I don't do it now!

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.130
Tanjiro created this one-in-a-million chance!

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.010
I'm going to slash her for sure! For sure!

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.890
Dammit, I can't cut through!

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.850
It's too hard!

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.730
The poison should've weakened him!

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.100
Am I still not strong enough?

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.150
He's already recovered from the poison!

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.070
I'm being engulfed! I'll get slashed!

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.990
My sword's being repelled!

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.830
I was so close!

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.710
I was so close to...

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.340
Don't give up! Don't give up!
Don't give up!

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.380
Hang on! Until the end!

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.380
You little punk!

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:30.470
His attack speed...

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.140
is increasing!

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.640
He's breaking down the poison!
He's making a full recovery!

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.310
Don't give up!

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.770
Don't give up!

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.110
Don't giveâ€”

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.700
He's not dead!

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.750
He wasn't dead!

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.250
His heart...

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:59.500
I get it!

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.840
He used his muscles
to force his heart to stop, huh?

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.630
That enabled him to temporarily stop
the poison from circulating!

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.970
Uzui!

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.880
I've finished my Musical Score Technique!

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.300
We're going for the win!

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.260
Don't make me laugh!

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.020
Ichi!

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.820
San! Shichi! Go! I! Kin!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.650
I can read it!

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.240
That filthy score of yours!

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.290
He deflected all of my
Rotating Circular Slashes!

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.410
Amazing!

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.090
"Score"? Did he say "score"?

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.840
Did he turn my Blood Demon Art
into a song and deflect it?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.470
When he only has one arm!

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.930
No way is this possible!

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.930
Don't give me this crap!

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.190
Amazing! He's holding his own!

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.270
But that's not enough to defeat him!

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.770
Uzui's going to reach his limit first!

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.860
I have to do it before that happens!

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.780
I have to cut off his neck!

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.830
Uzui!

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.830
Don't stop!

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.460
Jump!

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.300
You're too slow!

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.630
You little dumbass!

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.800
Even if you have someone to pave the way
for you, a loser is still a loser!

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.890
It's all over now!
The poison will kill you!

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.970
I'm gonna slash you!
I'm gonna behead you!

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.270
I'm not giving up!

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.020
I'm so going to behead you!

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.610
Damn you! Still swinging
your sword! You fool!

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.490
You couldn't behead me before!
What makes you think you can now?

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.530
I can't do it with just my arms! I have to slash him
with every ounce of strength I have!

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.250
From the top of my head
to the tips of my toes! Use it all!

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.830
Ignore all the pain in your body!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.210
Hang on!

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.250
Striking with all your might
won't be enough!

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.420
One hundred times the force!

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.510
Summon it by force!

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.600
Crap! Not by a brat like him!

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.100
Dammit! I'm about to be beheaded!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.690
No, I'm good!

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.240
Even if I get beheaded,
as long as my sister's head is still intact...

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.330
First, I'm going to finish this one off!

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.670
Dammit!

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.170
I have no more strength!

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.420
I'm going to chop you up into little pieces
before you can decapitate me!

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.010
What's he doing here?

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.010
Didn't my brother
impale him through the heart?

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:47.310
Don't underestimate
the flexibility of my body!

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:51.770
Shifting the position of my internal organs
is child's play for me!

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.780
And since I grew up on a harsh mountainside,
poison doesn't work on me, either!

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.450
Brother!

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.080
Do something, will you, Brother?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.500
I have to unleash the Rotating Circular Slashes!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.010
They beheaded them.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.090
They beheaded them!

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.890
Beheaded them! Beheaded them!

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.020
They beheaded them, Hinatsuru!

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.100
Please take a look
from beyond the grave!

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.690
What the... Do you even know
what you're saying?

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.980
- What?
- Dummy!

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.150
Ouch!

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.770
Wait!

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.820
Something seems off about this!

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.580
Th-The poison...

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.580
Deal with it with your breathing!

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.260
S-Slow down the poison
as much as you can!

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.180
Kamado! Get up! It's not over yet!

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.180
What?

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.720
He's saying something.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.850
His head...

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.230
Did I fail to cut it off after all?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.350
Run! This isn't over yet!

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.600
Uzui is...

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.730
saying something.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.610
Run!

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.940
NIN-NIN

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.060
Nin-nin!

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.490
Big Bro!

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.570
Big Bro, are you all right?

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.820
No, Brother! Live!

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.950
And now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret
about a certain something

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.460
that's helped my brother
overcome countless dangers like this!

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.590
My brother got his rock-hard head
from our mother!

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.420
When I was still a young child...

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.460
INOSUKE AS A BOAR

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.630
I hear...

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.390
that our mother once repulsed
a boar by head-butting him!

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.140
Next, the final episode,
"No Matter How Many Lives"!

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.480
Big Bro, I know you can do it!
Big Bro, I know you can win!

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.980
