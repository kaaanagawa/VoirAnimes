What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.020
Do I have to grope around

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.100
You must be kidding me.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.820

<i>It was way too easy.</i>

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.250
<i>Could this be a dream, too?</i>

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.630
<i>Or was this demon weaker than him?</i>

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.630
I can totally see why...

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:44.220
he ordered me to kill you,
the boy with the earrings,

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.560
along with the Hashira!

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.900
Your very existence is, like...

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.240
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.990
<i>He's not dying?</i>

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.160
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.870
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.330
You want to know why I'm not dead
after you decapitated me, don't you?

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.920
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:20.800
It's so easy
even an infant would understand.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.430
It's because the body over there
was no longer my main body.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.270
Same with this thing
that's talking to you now.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.940
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.440
While you were snoozing away...

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.450 position:20% line:20%
MUGEN

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.320
I fused with this train!

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:49.460
Every inch of this train has become
my blood, my flesh and my bones!

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.330
Look at your face.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.210
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.340
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.260
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.720
as well as my hostages.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.270
So, do you think
you can protect them by yourself?

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:16.480
All these people packing this train
from one end to the other...

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.320 line:20%
Can you alone keep me
from devouring them?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.790
<i>What should I do? What should I do?</i>

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.500 line:20%
<i>The most I can protect on my own is two cars!</i>

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.210 line:20%
<i>Any more than that,
and I can't guarantee their safety!</i>

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.670
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:45.050
This is no time to be sleeping!
Wake up, will you? Please!

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.300 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.810 line:20%
Protect the sleeping passengers!

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.160
Follow me, damn minions!

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.610
All right!

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.830
<i>Explosive Awakening!</i>

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.620
Comin' through!

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.910
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.210
<i>Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...</i>

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.710
<i>Crazy Cutting!</i>

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:29.970 line:20%
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.150
Inosuke, I'm so glad you're here!

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.240
Of course I came!
I'm the boss, you know!

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.700
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.370
Inosuke's Kasugai Crow
is named Dongurimaru.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.080
He's always by Inosuke's side,
but he nearly got eaten by him,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.080
so now I hear that he's staying invisible!

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.630
Inosuke, I'm really counting on you!

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.710
Don't be so bossy!
You're just an underling!

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.130
You make me feel so secure
when you're around, Inosuke!

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.140
Don't make me feel so warm and fuzzy!

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.470
Let's go, Monjiro!

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.020
Right!

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.270
Next, Episode 5, "Move Forward!"
