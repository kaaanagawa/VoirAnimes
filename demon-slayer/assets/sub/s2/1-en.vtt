Delicious!

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.730
Flame Hashira, forgive me
for interrupting your meal.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.190
Okay! Take a seat here.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.650
Mister, bring this young man
the same thing I'm having!

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.110
Are you sure it's okay?

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.950
Of course it's okay!
I'll have another bowl myself!

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.870
You sure eat with gusto, don't you?

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.870
Just sit tight.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.460
Flame Hashira,
your work last night was stellar.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.710
No.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.470
It was after the demon fled, after all.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.720
How's the injured woman doing?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.390
According to the doctor,
her wounds won't leave her with any scars.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.390
I see. Good thing she got treated early.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.270
Yes. It's thanks to your heroics.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.450
Thank you for the meal!

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.830
What's this?

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.000
That's my treat.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.420
Appreciate it!

that Slasher being at large around here,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.520

the other day.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.160 line:20%
On top of that, do you know that
the Mugen Train is out of service now?

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.540 line:20%
Rumor has it...

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.550
that around 40 of its passengers
just disappeared without a trace.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.090
Oh... It sounds ominous.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.050
Flame Hashira,
getting back to why I'm here...

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.180
We've located the Mugen Train.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.180
We've received word that it was secretly
transported to a certain train shed.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.560
Is that right?

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.810
Delicious!

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.320
Will we be heading to the Mugen Train?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.400
Right.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.820
But first...

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.620 line:20%
let's inspect the station
where the conductor's body was found.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.710
Fuku, enough of that sighing.
Go on and eat your bean paste bun.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.170
Yeah.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.930
Not many customers today again, right?

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.390
I know that I say this every day,
but it's dangerous to be out after dark.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.060
Tomorrow, you can start
helping out in the afternoon.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.690
Since the demons come out at night.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.230
All clear!

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.740
I took a look around the area,
but there was nothing amiss.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.700
Right!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.160
There aren't any demons!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.990
You're bringing up demons again?

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.910
Just stop, will you?
I have to sell as many bento as I can!

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.250
It's hard enough
with my mother being pregnant,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.920
and I heard that
my father's shop isn't doing well.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.180
I'll take care of things in the early mornings
and nighttime by myself, okay?

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.770

Grandma!

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.650
Well, good evening!

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.150
The moon is exquisite tonight, is it not?

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.740
I'm searching for a demon.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.490
You haven't seen one, have you?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.370
What? Just like that?

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.160
Lord Kyojuro!
You're being far too blunt!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.750
Ma'am, is there something
you can tell me?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.300
D-Demon? What kind of talk is that?
Wh-What's wrong with you?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.970
Stay away from us!

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.390
Look out!

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.010 line:20%
If you keep shaking like that,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.350 line:20%
you'll end up dropping
your precious bean paste bun!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.940
Stay away from me!

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.610
Delicious!

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.280
I don't believe in demons!

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.620
There's no way there could be any,
and you know it!

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.830
Fuku, that's enough.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.080
I don't believe this man is a bad person.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.090
I'm sorry. I feel like I'm always on edge
these days because of the Slasher incidents.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.180
If what I was just told is correct,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:15.140
you two start working while it's still dark out
and come to sell us those bento.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.600
I couldn't be more thankful.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.610
No one should ever hurt people like you.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.860
But you can rest easy now!
I'll take care of the Slasher!

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.950
Who in the world are you?

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.610
All right, then!

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.240
Excuse me!

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.580
Um... If you don't mind,
could you maybe buy some bento?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.130
That's a good idea!

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.000
Okay!

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.880
I'll buy them all!

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.590
Excuse me, Flame Hashira...

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.310
That'll make a splendid gift
for the other Corps members!

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.600
I'll be going on alone now.
Thanks for your hard work.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.850
Goodbye.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.190
What was that all about?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.070
I'm glad he bought all those bento, but...

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.910
Let's hurry home now, Fuku.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.870
I'm getting a really bad feeling.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.750
I can feel a chill going down my spine.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.120
Grandma?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.070
Who...

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.490
Who are you?

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.160
I'm a bento vendor as you can see!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.660
I am in no way suspicious!

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.250
But this train is heading to the shed now.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.590
Right! I'm aware of that.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.010
I heard that's where
I can find the Mugen Train.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.630
That's the one I have business with.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.890
The Mugen Train?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.300
If that's the one you're looking for,
it's no longer in the shed.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.100
Is that right?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.020
It was transported to a well-equipped
maintenance facility this morning.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.900
That one over there.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.860
Ah.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.070
All right, then this is
where I'm getting off!

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.030
What?

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.860
What do you mean, "get off"?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:28.790
Hey!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.380
I was sent here by the Railway Bureau
to deliver these bento.

Oh?

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.640
Hey! He says he brought us bento!

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.190
Hey, take one to Tatsu.
He's resting in the office.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.560
Yes, sir.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.190
Why was the Mugen Train brought here?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.740
Right, when there's no way
it's a problem with the body.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.490
Word on the street
is that it's a man-eating train.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.200
You don't know how bitter that makes us.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.250
So now that it's being put
back into service,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.380
we want to do all we can to get her back into shape
and send her back out into the world.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.380
Back into service?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.470
Yeah, tomorrow night.
That's why we're all here—

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.720
Demon!

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.560
There's a demon here!

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.280
Oh!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.240
Tatsu!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.490
All of you, step back!

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.200
Chief!

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
You bastard...

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.830
Let the boy go!

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.540
A Demon Slayer? How arrogant.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.750
Ugh! What's this stench?

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.760
Ever since I became a demon,
I can't stand human food. It's so disgusting.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.010
That bento was made with love
by people I know.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.600
I can't just ignore that.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.560
If it's revolting, it's revolting.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.060
Hey boy, your blood smells
like it might be revolting, too.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.690
I'll just devour the humans that seem tasty,
but the ones that taste bad...

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.160
I like to show myself a good time
by tormenting them all night!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.030
So, that's what this is about, Slasher?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.660
I find you offensive.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.830
If you don't like me, then...

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.540
let's see you slash me!

Wha...

Hey, sorry about that.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.890
You can't bring yourself to slash me
with this kid in my arms.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.730

and just kill him off?

Don't worry!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.780
I'm going to save you, no matter what!

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.610 line:20%
Not on your life. Just yesterday...

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.290 line:20%
I slashed this other woman
until I was sick of doing it.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.750
I see. Now I know how fast you are.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.750
But I wouldn't get cocky if I were you.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:22.630
Last night, we thought
you'd fled because we showed up,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:26.470
but apparently, you never even detected us.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.640
It's true that you're quick to escape at least!

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.020 line:20%
What?

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.400
We were able to treat your victim
from last night right away.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.490
She'll recover without even a single scar.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:51.290
Even if she does survive, she's doomed
to be consumed by fear for the rest of her life.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.000
I won't let that happen!

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.540
We're going to treat
the wounds of her soul,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.790
no matter how hard it may be to heal them,
for as long as it takes!

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:04.220
I'll show that self-righteous
face of yours a thing or two.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.800
I'm going to go kill that woman again!

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.140
We're keeping her hidden!

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.680
You'll never find her!

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.520 line:20%
All right, then those bento vendors...

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.150
They have nothing to do with me!

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.990
But you know them, right?

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.780
Those are station bento, right?
I can find out where they're from.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.240
Don't move!

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.240
You do offend me, you know.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.250
Well, I'm enjoying this!

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.500
If you want to save them,
then get to the station before me.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.670
Before that happens...

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.170
I'll have to kill this one!

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.440
I'll be going on ahead.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.950
Please...

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.330 line:20%
Please save him!

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.040 line:20%
It'll be okay. Just leave it to me.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.960 line:20%
Also, my friends will be coming soon.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.460
This way! This way! This way!

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.050
Lord Rengoku!

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.380
Where's the medical squad?

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.760
They're on their way.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.800
I've given him first aid.
I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.320
<i>Total Concentration Breathing.</i>

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.880
Really, you don't listen, do you?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.840
If I say I'm going to help,
then I'm going to help!

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.550
Good morning!

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.310
Hey! You're as early as ever!

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.940
I can smell them!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.200
All right!

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.290
Station Master?

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.790
It smells. It smells!

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.540
It's you, isn't it?

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.050
The one who's got the stink
of those bento clinging to her!

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.300
Don't take this personally.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.300
It's all that Demon Slayer's fault!

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.190
Make a run for it, Fuku!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.190
What's the big idea, you hag?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.890
Y-You're...

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.890
You're not hurt, are you?

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.640
Grandma!

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:47.900
Damn!

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.410
Hey, old hag...

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.240
You're going to wish you hadn't...

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.000
How the hell...

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.750
did you catch up to me?

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.680
I thought I told you not to get cocky.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.350
Why don't we see who's faster?

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.730
Whether I can slash
this old hag's throat first

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.190
or you can claim my head first!

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.570
No need to put it to the test.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.200
You're...

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.120
slow!

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.160
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.450
<i>First Form...</i>

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.710
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.880
You...

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.920
saved us, didn't you?

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.010
Twice.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.260
Grandma...

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.140
I'll never forget that face, that haori.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.180
Fuku's mother...

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.060
and I...

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:56.070
20 years ago, you saved our lives.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.820
Grandma, what are you talking about?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.080
That must've been my father.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.790
I'm following in my father's footsteps,
slaying demons.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.590
I'm honored to have protected you
just as my father did.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.100
I still can't believe it!

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.350
I'm sorry for saying that
there couldn't be any demons, Grandma.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.570
No! That's how it should be!

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.280
Not knowing about demons,
never running into one...

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.360
There's no better way to live out your life!

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.620
Flame Hashira! Are you all right?

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.910
I only just took care of it now.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.460
Thank you for a job well done!

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.370
Right!

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.840
So, what about the Mugen Train?

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.300
The maintenance work
will be done tonight,

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.880
and it's going back into service tomorrow.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.140
I'm glad to hear that!
So all's well that ends well, right?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.850
It's a little too soon to be saying that.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.520
A demon who's devoured more than 40 people
is surely on a different level than this one.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.270
Then, the Slasher was only here
to serve as a distraction?

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.570
That might very well be true.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.570
Either way, there's a different demon
on the Mugen Train.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.700
A demon who's far more powerful
and mysterious is lurking somewhere.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.660
Tomorrow, to the Mugen Train, then.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.920 line:20%
Needless to say, I'll be boarding it!

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.210
Actually, it's today now!

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.590 line:20%
Hey, Pops, did you hear?

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.010 line:20%
Huh?

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.680 line:20%
They say that the Mugen Train
is back in service.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.180 position:20% line:20%
MUGEN TRAIN
TO RESUME OPERATION

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.180
Oh?

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.190
I just hope nothing odd happens again.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:07.990
Excuse me!

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.290 line:20%
Hey there, bento vendor!

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.750 line:20%
I don't know what to say
to thank you for this morning.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.880 line:20%
Please take these.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.840 line:20%
This is all that we have to give you.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:23.670
Ah! The thing is,
I missed out on having one last night!

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.090
Nothing could make me happier!

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.850
But I will pay for it.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.100
No, it's the thought
that counts!

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.020
Is that right?
Then let me accept this one

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.520
and buy all the rest that you have there!

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.230
Whaaaaat?

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.990
Please be careful.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.700
Please stop by again
if you're in the area!

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.780 line:20%
I promise to tell my father about you two.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.700 line:20%
I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.290
Now then, take care!
Let's meet again one day!

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.230
Wha...

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.110
Wh-What...

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.110
What the hell is this creature?

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.320 line:20%
Here's your first-class bento!
That will be 36 sen, please!

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.950 line:20%
Would you like some tea
or sake with that?

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.540 line:20%
Comin' through!

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.080
Stop it! You're embarrassing us!

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.210
What's going on?

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.990
Now then, let me partake of this
with gratitude!

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.460
Delicious!

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.520
So, we were able
to board the Mugen Train!

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.440
Tanjiro, isn't there something
you want to ask the Flame Hashira?

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.820
I hope we get to meet him!

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.570
Yeah!

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.360
Hashira, huh? Fight me!

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.580
Stop that yammering!
Just shut up!

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.290
What did you say?

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.750
You have a problem with that?

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.790
Okay, we hear you, Inosuke!
Calm down now!

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.210
You idiot boar!

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.750
Anyway, I wonder what kind of person
the Flame Hashira is.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.920
Well—

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.220
It's the Kasugai Crow!

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.060
It seems like the Kasugai Crow
has looked into Rengoku for us.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.640
What? Really?

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.230
He says he found out
how the other Hashira feel about Rengoku.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.520
That I have to hear!

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.530
Hashira! All of you, fight me!

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.740
All right. Tanjiro, let's hear it.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.320
Okay. Then, let me start

HOW THE INSECT HASHIRA
SHINOBU KOCHO
SEES RENGOKU

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.540
I'd say he's a good person.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.500
Though there are times
when we're not on the same wavelength.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.040
Lady Shinobu!
You remind me of that good smell!

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:45.460
How about the other Hashira?

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.340
Okay, let's hear them all in one go!

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:52.590 line:20%
ACCORDING TO TENGEN UZUI

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.550
Flamboyant!
Sticks out even more than me.

That cheery voice
is so comforting to hear.

He's a super-cool big brother!

I had so much fun
training with him!

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.100
He really doted on me!

Never whines.

So, something like that.
