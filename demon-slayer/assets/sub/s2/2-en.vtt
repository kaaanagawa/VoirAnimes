00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.450
Sorry! We're very sorry!

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.120
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.330

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.500
MUGEN

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.760
He's a Hashira, right?

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.380
This Rengoku person...

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.640
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:38.760
Sure.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.810
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.060
Hey!

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.480
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.320

Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.040
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.670
Not just some random glutton?

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.290
- Delicious!
- Right.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.750

Uh, we really get that part already.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.360
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.440
Yes.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.240
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.120
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.160
I see. And inside that box there...

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.370
Yes.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.460
It's my sister Nezuko.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.130
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.550
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.930
Have a seat here.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.560
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.230
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.900
What are you three doing here?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.740
A mission?

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.160
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.750
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.380
Yes! I see now! Understood!

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.500
Right.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.550
Also, there's one more thing.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.260
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.680
What is it? Let's hear it.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.390
About my father...

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.430
What about your father?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.140
Well, he was really frail.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.480
Was he really?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.940
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.650
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.940
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.360
The thing is...

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.360
What's up?

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.490
Hinokami Kagura...

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.030
Dance!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.910
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.830
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.300
I was hoping you'd tell me.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.840
Right!

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.100
But I know nothing!

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.310
I've never even heard
the term "Hinokami Kagura" before.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.940
But it's truly commendable that your father
was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.320
All right, end of discussion!

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.400
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.240
You should become my Tsuguko,
my apprentice! I'll look after you!

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.410
Hold on a second!
And just what are you looking at?

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.870
<i>He's totally weird, all right.</i>

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.460
Flame Breathing has a long history.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.090
In any given era, there's always been a Flame
and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.550
Flame.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.840
Water.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.130
Wind.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.430
Stone.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.550
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.180
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

Young Mizoguchi!

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.440
What color is your sword?

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.570
My name's Kamado.
And the color is black.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.070
A black sword, huh?

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.120
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.120
For real?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.750
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.130
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.090
Come to me, and I'll train you!

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.880
You can rest easy now!

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.380
No, thank you!

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.430
And just what are you looking at?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.730
<i>He's strange,
but he seems to be very caring.</i>

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.360
<i>And from his scent,
I can pick up his strong sense of justice.</i>

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.660
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.370
That's dangerous, you idiot!

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.250
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.170
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.920
You never know when a demon might appear.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.430
You're kidding, right?
Demons show up on this train?

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.180
Sure do!

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.350
What? They do?

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.020
Nooo! So, we're not heading
to where the demons are, but we're here?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.770
Nooo!

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.520
I'm getting off!

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.070
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.610
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.660
That's why I, a Hashira, am here!

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.630
Right, I see!
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.720
May I...

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.300
see your...

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.310
tickets, please?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.890
What's he doing?

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.020

your ticket and punch a hole in it.

Mr. Conductor...

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.450
You could get hurt,
so step back.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.000
As this is an emergency,
please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.810
Was it a Blood Demon Art
that hid that massive body?

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.270
I had a hard time detecting you.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.740

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.700

He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.070
There's still one more.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.740
Come with me!

I said I'm your opponent.

Please make me your apprentice!

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.350

To be able to die while dreaming...

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.710
Just how lucky are you?

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:49.210
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:55.380
A human's driving force
is the heart, the spirit!

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.890
All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.600
You can kill them just like that!

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.560
All human hearts are the same.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.780
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.990
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:23.330
That's right. Don't forget
what he warned us about.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.590
Take a deep, slow breath...

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.590
while you count.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.600
<i>Do that, and you'll fall asleep.</i>

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.310
<i>One...</i>

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.930
<i>Two...</i>

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:47.520
<i>Three...</i>

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.350
<i>Four...</i>

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.400
<i>Five...</i>

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.190
<i>Six...</i>

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.660
And then, we were surprised
because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.540
What a weirdo!

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.670
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:13.000
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.590
You don't have a fever, do you?

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.600
Take it easy
and get some rest today, okay?

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.600
I'm all right.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.100
Are you sure?

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.640
Hey! You come back here!

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.400
Gotcha!

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.480
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.490
Hey! You stop that right now!

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.490 line:20%
Seems like...

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.280
I was having a bad dream or something.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.250
Falling deeper into sleep,
deep in their dreams...

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.630
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.380
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.880 line:20%
Even in the stomach,
deep in their dreams...

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.140
It looks like fun.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.390
You're starting to have
a happy dream, aren't you?

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.140
You are falling...

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:14.650
You are falling...

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.770
into a dream.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.660
It's a deep slumber.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.910
They can...

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.670 position:80% line:50%
LOWER ONE

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.210 line:20%
no longer awaken.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.100
Everyone, it's time for a mission!

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.480
Zenitsu, Inosuke and Rengoku!

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.230
It's time for a mission!

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.110
Oh well...

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.490
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.990
Rengoku doesn't have any Tsuguko.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:34.500
That's because his training's too tough
and everyone runs away. So I've heard.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.000
But if it's going to help me
turn Nezuko back into a human again,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.080
I want to be trained by a Hashira!

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.960
Rengoku, will you train me—

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.430
Next episode...

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.720
"Should Have Been."

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.970
