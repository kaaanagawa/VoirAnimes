Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.320 line:20%

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.700 line:20%
I'm okay.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.160
Just forget about that bastard!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.670
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.500
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.130
I know! Let's get moving!

Are you okay, Inosuke?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.980
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.320
Y-Yeah!

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.940
Inosuke, protect the passen—

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.070
<i>I can't die.</i>

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.580

I was lucky I could bounce

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.870
Cool, huh?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.040
Is your belly okay?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.830
Your belly that got stabbed!

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.170
I'm...

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.130
all right.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.880
What about you?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.300
Never felt better!
I didn't even catch a cold!

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.010
I won't be able to move for a while.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.970
Help the others, will you?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.350
Was anyone injured?

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.860
What about the engineer near the head?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.360
It's okay if that bastard dies!

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.820
It's not okay.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.450
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.870
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.580
His leg's shattered,
and he can't walk anymore!

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.040
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.170
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.630
Help him, will you?

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.130
Please.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.810
I'll go for you, then!

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.810
Because I'm the boss!

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.730
Because my minion asked me to!

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.150
After I rescue him,
I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.660
That's really not necessary.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.160

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.540
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.210
<i>Ridiculous!
I haven't been able to go all out!</i>

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.710
<i>I couldn't devour a single human!</i>

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.210
<i>My plan to fuse with the train and devour
humans en masse just went up in smoke!</i>

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.220 line:20%
<i>And now, look what I've been reduced to!</i>

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.970 line:20%
<i>After all the time and trouble I've taken!</i>

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.720 line:20%
<i>It was him!</i>

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.850
<i>It's all his fault!</i>

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.690
<i>Even though I'd taken
200 humans hostage, still I struggled!</i>

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.570
<i>I was held at bay!</i>

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.990
<i>Is this the power of a Hashira?</i>

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.700
<i>And him... He was fast, too.</i>

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.780
<i>Even though he never broke
the spell completely!</i>

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.250
<i>Not to mention that girl!
She's a demon! What's that about?</i>

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.750
<i>A demon, joining forces
with Demon Slayers?</i>

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.540
<i>Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?</i>

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.420
<i>Dammit! Dammit!</i>

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.800
<i>In the first place...</i>

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.890
<i>it all started going downhill
once that brat broke my spell!</i>

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.310
<i>That brat is to blame!</i>

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.140
<i>I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!</i>

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.400
<i>That's right, and that boar, too!</i>

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.900
<i>I could've at least killed that brat!</i>

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.110
<i>But that boar thwarted me.
His intuition is extraordinary.</i>

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.320
<i>He could sense my gaze!</i>

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.740
<i>Am I going to lose?</i>

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.700
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.090
<i>Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!</i>

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.090
<i>It's always the bottom-feeder demons
who get killed by the Demon Slayers.</i>

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.760
<i>In the Upper Ranks,</i>

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.470
<i>the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.</i>

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.430
<i>They're strong enough to defeat Hashira
who've killed an untold number of demons.</i>

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.440
<i>Do they have otherworldly powers?</i>

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:31.320
<i>Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!</i>

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.490
<i>I want to do it over!
I want to do it over!</i>

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:42.160
<i>What a miserable nightmare this is...</i>

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.340
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.970
Impressive!

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.970
Rengoku...

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.100
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.480
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.810
I'll do my best.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.480
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.820
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.820
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.410
There's a blood vessel.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.870
A torn blood vessel.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.710 line:20%
Concentrate harder!

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.760 line:20%
That's it. Stanch it.
Stop the bleeding.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.440
Focus!

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.450
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.620
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.460
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.460
but you'll become a stronger version
of yourself than yesterday for sure.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.210
Right.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.510
Everyone's safe!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.550
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.390
Don't strain yourself.
Take it easy and rest up.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.520
Thank you very much.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.110
<i>What's he doing here and now?</i>

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.790
<i>Flame Breathing, Second Form...</i>

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.220
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.730
That's a fine sword.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.730
<i>He sure can regenerate fast.</i>

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.480
<i>This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...</i>

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.360
<i>So, this is an Upper Rank.</i>

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.370
I can't understand why you'd go
after a wounded person first.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.700
He could get in the way
of the chitchat... of you and me.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.290
What would you and I have to talk about?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.710
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.420
Is that right?
Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.050
The sight of a weakling
makes my skin crawl.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.640
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.890
All right, then I have
a brilliant proposal for you.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.730
Why don't you become a demon, too?

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.230
I will not.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.070
I can tell your strength at a glance.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.700
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.820
Your fighting spirit
has been honed to the hilt.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.160
It's close to the realm of the highest.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.330
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.790
I'm Akaza.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.250
Kyojuro...

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.300
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.300
Because you're a human.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.640
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.560
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.980
Do that, and you can go on training
for a hundred, for two hundred years.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.560
You can become stronger.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:24.070
<i>Of all the demons that I've met until now,
he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!</i>

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.320
<i>I have to help him fight!</i>

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:33.790
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.330
The fact that we grow old and die

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.710
is what makes human life
so unbearably precious and noble.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.930 line:20%
"Strength" isn't a word
used to describe just the body.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.970
This boy isn't weak!

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.230
Don't insult him.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.270
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.520
You and I have different senses of value.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.110
No matter what the reason,
I will not become a demon!

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.620
I see.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.410
<i>Technique Development...</i>

<i>I can't follow their movements!</i>

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.910
There were never any Flames
among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.380
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.720
Why do you think that is?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.010
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.930
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.320
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.650
It pains me! I can't bear it!

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.410 line:20%
Die, Kyojuro...

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.490 line:20%
while you're still young and strong.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.410

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.000
<i>Air Type!</i>

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.260
<i>I see.</i>

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.310
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.810
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.890
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.230
<i>When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!</i>

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.780
<i>He can move
faster than the blink of an eye.</i>

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.670
<i>If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.</i>

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.920
<i>In that case...</i>

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.630
<i>I'll just have to get up close!</i>

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.260
This superb reaction speed of yours...

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.230
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.810
Kyojuro!

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.310
Doesn't that make you sad?

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.730
It happens to everyone!

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.520
It's a fact of life for any human!

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.190
Stay where you are!

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.070
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!
Stand back! That's an order!

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.780
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.330
Come on, give me your best shot!

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.330
Concentrate on me.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.100
Nice moves!

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.480
Rengoku!

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.940
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.200
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.330
Fight me forever
and get stronger together with me.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.080
You have what it takes to do that!

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.920
I'll pass!

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:55.630
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.390
I will not become a demon!

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.100 line:20%
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.020 line:20%
<i>Third Form...</i>

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.600
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.230
Magnificent! That's sensational!

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.280
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.360
<i>Air Type!</i>

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.670
<i>There's no opening.</i>

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.170
<i>I can't jump in.</i>

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.710
<i>I can't keep up
with the speed of their movements!</i>

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.460
<i>Those two are in a different dimension!</i>

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.840
<i>Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!</i>

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.850
<i>I can't move...</i>

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.770
<i>because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!</i>

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.230
Rengoku...

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:55.610
You still don't get it?

00:18:55.610 --> 00:19:01.200
That if you continue attacking,
you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.250
<i>Flame Breathing, First Form...</i>

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.500
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.920
It would be a shame to kill you now!

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.630
You haven't reached
your physical peak yet!

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600
<i>Second Form...</i>

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.640
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.860 line:20%
In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills
even more, and you'll have greater precision!

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.330
<i>Third Form...</i>

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.040
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.540
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.880
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.010
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.590
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.300
<i>Flame Tiger!</i>

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.390
<i>Disorder!</i>

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.020
Kyojuro!

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.130
Did he do it? Did he win?

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.160 line:20%
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.670
<i>No way!</i>

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.680
Let's fight more.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.850 line:20%
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.360
Rengoku!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.150
Rengoku!

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.320
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.330
Rengoku...

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.250
Rengoku!

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.220
Rengoku!

NEXT

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.550
FINAL EPISODE

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:38.930
"SET YOUR HEART ABLAZE"

I...

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.930 line:20%
I will fulfill my duty!
