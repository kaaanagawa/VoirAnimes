00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
TOKITO HOUSE

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.480
Oiran! Oiran!

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.980
Let's play! Let's play!

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.020
Fine, fine.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.480
Oiran!

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.240
Read me a story!

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.530
VERY YOUNG
CHILDREN

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.110
I'll be happy to.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.780
Which should I read?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.410
YOUNG
LADY

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410
Hmm, let's see.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.410
Me, too!

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.580
YOUNG
LADY

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.580
Read me a story, too!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.500
All right, then let me read this one first,
and when I'm done, shall I read that one?

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.880
You can read mine later!

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.500
Mine, too!

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.130
You always copy me!

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.720
Well, becauseâ€”

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.140
Now, now...

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.010
Oh, that reminds me!

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.180
First, l have something to give to you two.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.850
What is it? What is it?

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150
What are you giving us, Oiran?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.620
But...

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.290
these are your treasures,
aren't they, Oiran?

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.620
It's okay. Don't you worry.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.170
I want to give them to you
because I'm fond of you both.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.800
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.090
Oiran! Oiran! Put this comb on me!

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.970
Now! Now!

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.470
Right. One at a time, okay?

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.030
EPISODE 4:
TONIGHT

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.030
Nowhere to be found?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.370
Yes. Uh, it's Zenko.
The one with the yellow hair.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.380
She'd fainted, so we put her to bed,
but she's not in her room.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.750
Shall I have them look for her?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.300
Don't bother.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.130
Forget it. Don't look for her.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.630
It's Ashinuke! What do I care!

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.260
She must've run off somewhere.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.640
Just forget about it.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.640
But Master...

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310
Would you shut the hell up?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.650
Dismissed!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.400
Don't ever mention Zenko's name again!

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.400
Tell the others not to, either.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.910
It's all because they got
on Warabihime Oiran's nerves!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.410
Both Zenko and Omitsu.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.750
I... told... you!

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.920
There's a demon at my House, all right?

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.510
Well...

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.760
I'm telling you, it was a thing like this!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.680
You know, like this!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.850
Yeah, sure, uh...

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.680
Hold up a second, okay?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.100
Like this?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.190
Do you get this, then?

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.820
Uzui and Zenitsu should be
coming soon to check in, soâ€”

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.320
It was like this, okay?
It was clear to me!

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.240
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.700
Zenitsu won't be coming.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.700
This guy's got mad skills!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.910
He didn't make a sound.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.580
Not even the slightest puff of wind!

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.210
"Zenitsu won't be coming."
What do you mean by that?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.050
I feel bad about putting you through this.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.100
I wanted to...

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.980
rescue my wives so badly,
I made some bad decisions.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.230
As it stands, Zenitsu is missing.
There's been no contact since last night.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.780
You two should leave now.
You're ranked too low for this.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.950
If the demon here turns out to be
an Upper Rank, you couldn't handle it.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.000
If you vanish from here,
they'll assume that you're dead.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.670
I'll be continuing this mission on my own.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.840
No, Uzui, weâ€”

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.800
Don't be ashamed!

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.380
Whoever survives, wins.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.300
Don't overlook your chance.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.560
Come back here, old man!

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.070
You think he can't trust us
because we're the lowest ranked?

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.610
Hey, our rank is Kanoe.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.990
We've already moved up.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.820
Huh?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.320
Do you remember all the rankings?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.080
KANAO

00:05:49.320 --> 00:06:05.340
KINOE
KINOTO
HINOE
HINOTO
TSUCHINOE
TSUCHINOTO
KANOE
KANOTO
MIZUNOE
MIZUNOTO

00:05:49.320 --> 00:06:05.340
USED TO BE HERE

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.490
Remember how we used to be Mizunoto
at the very bottom?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.580
Now we're fourth from the bottom, Kanoe!

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:05.340
KANAO
NOW WE'RE HERE!!

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.540
Oh snap! You caught up to me!

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.290
Eat it, you pissant crybaby!

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.340
We'll be moving past you in no time!

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.670
What was that, you stupid boar?

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.340
You wanna fight?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.550
HEADS

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.850
Ready? Watch this.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.560
Show me my ranking.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.350
KANOE

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.860
How do you like that?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.110
What was that?

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.120
Huh? They fiddled with your arm
at the Wisteria Mountain, didn't they?

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.740
I remember them fiddling with it,
but I was exhausted.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.580
It's called "Wisteria Flower Engraving," and you say
that phrase and flex your muscles to invoke it.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.460
I had no idea about that.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.760
It's a sign that you're a Demon Slayer.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.890
Hey, cheer up!

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.850
Wait! We don't have time for this! Sorry!

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.020
As soon as night falls,
I'll head over to your Ogimoto House!

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.190
OGIMOTO HOUSE

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.190
So wait for me until then.
It'd be dangerous to make a move on your own!

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.150
Why should I do that?

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.860
I'll be done investigating
my own House today!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.570
I told you, the demon's at my House,
so you'd better come with me now!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.070
How stupid are you, anyway?
For crying out loud!

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.530
Would they just shut up?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.080
That's not what I meant!

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.080
Uzui was patrolling outside the Houses
during the night, right?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.460
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.920
Even still, Zenitsu disappeared!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.090
And the demon at your place
is nowhere to be seen right now!

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.600
Hey! Could you stop smacking me around?

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.600
I think there must be a passageway
inside the building!

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.980
Passageway?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.110
That's right. And since
it's not coming in and out...

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.690
there's a good chance
that the demon is working on the inside.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.860
If the demon's working in the House...

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.870
and cleverly disguising itself as a human...

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.870
then it'd be all the more careful about killing people
to make sure that its cover won't be blown.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.920
I get it.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.920
Cleaning up after a murder
would be a hassle.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.130
And wiping away bloodstains
would be a chore.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.300
This is a nightlife district.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.140
It can be convenient for demons in more ways
than one, but also just as inconvenient for them.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.470
They have to work at night.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.180
It would seem suspicious
if they weren't around.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.390
You're right.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.110
I think that not only Zenitsu,
but Uzui's wives, as well, are all still alive!

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.030
I'm going to take action with that in mind.
I'm going to rescue them, no matter what!

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.780
I want you to take action
with that in mind, too.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.530
And no matter what...

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.370
I don't want you to die.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.460
Are you okay with that?

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.210
Everything you just said...

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.470
is what I was about to say myself!

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.050
Oiran...

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.970
We've brought you your tea.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.230
Thank you. I can do the rest myself,
so go on and have your dinner.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.860
All right!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.110
- We'll be going on ahead, then!
- Pardon us!

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.620
I love you, Koinatsu Oiran!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.700
I love you, too!

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.670
Yes! I love you right back!

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.710
Now that we're clear, go on, okay?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.920
- Right!
- Right!

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.920
Didn't Oiran look really happy?

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.220
Didn't she?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.970
Oh, those girls...

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.230
Miss Koinatsu?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.230
Sumi?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.740
Forgive me for being so rude.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.610
I am leaving the Tokito House.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.120
Could you please give Master
my payment for my food and lodging?

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.960
Sumi...

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.630
The way you're dressed...

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.960
I had to dress as a woman
for certain reasons,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.800
but I'm actually a guy!

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.380
Oh, I already knew that.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.220
It was obvious at a glance.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.800
And your voice...

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.270
What?

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.270
I knew you were a boy from the start.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.320
I did wonder what you were up to, but...

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.780
Who knew that I was busted?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.240
You have your reasons, don't you?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.580
You were worried about Suma
for real, weren't you?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.330
Yes! That's the truth! That was no lie!

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.710
I promise you
I'll rescue everyone who vanished!

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.460
Thank you.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.720
That sets my mind at ease a bit.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.720
You see, I'm leaving
this district tomorrow.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.730
Is that right?
You must be so happy!

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.980
There's someone who would want
even me as his wife.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.730
I really couldn't be happier right now!

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.860
But...

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.070
that's all the more reason why I was worried sick
about those I'm leaving behind.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.200
Even if I were to get a bad feeling
about something,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.040
I have no way of even looking into it.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.540
No one can blame you for that.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.130
Please don't worry about it.
Please always keep a smile on your face.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.010
I don't want you to disappear, either...

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.890
Sumi.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.770
Now then, I'll be off.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.900
I wish you every happiness.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.240
Thank you.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.110
You, too, Sumi.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.910
And I'm counting on you to save Suma.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.410
Right!

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.180
Did you forget something?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.230
That's right.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.190
I need to devour you before I forget.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:43.860
UPPER SIX

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.440
Since tonight's your last night here.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.110
Right, Koinatsu?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.200
Not good!

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.500
The sun's almost set completely!

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.420
I gotta get to Inosuke's place fast!

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.510
There's a scent.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.010
A sweet smell. It's faint.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.100
It's a demon!

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.640
It's the scent of a demon!

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.060
It's nearby!

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.020
No way!

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.020
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:24.030
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.530
Late!

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.580
It's almost nightfall,
and he's not here yet!

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.040
Souichiro, you moron!

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.290
I'm gonna take action...

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:38.040
with the spirit of "Comin' through!"
in my heart!

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.050
Hey, mice! My swords!

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.930
That guy has mad skills.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.270
Muscle! Muscle!

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:55.770
Muscle!

00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.270
Setting me up with these
"Muscular Mice" subordinates!

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.280
I wanna boss around some Ninju, too!

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.940
- Muscle!
- Muscle!

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.530
- Muscle!
- Muscle!

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.530
- Muscle! Muscle!
- Muscle! Muscle!

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.540
Let's go slay some demons!

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.620
Comin'...

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.120
through!

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.640
What happened to Zenko and Hinatsuru?

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.010
Give me the short version.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.310
No questions from you, got that?

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.020
Zenko's disappeared.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.900
Hinatsuru fell ill and left for the Kirimise.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.120
Tell me everything
that you think might be relevant.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.410
Who are you suspecting?

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.410
You can trust me, so speak up.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.670
I'll kill whoever it is if it's the last thing I do.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.380
I'll get revenge for you.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.510
Omitsu...

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:18.430
An Oiran named Warabihime.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:23.110
She's in a room on the north side
that has no light.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.790
Not here.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.790
She must be on the prowl for humans.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.300
I'll head to where Hinatsuru is
as I try to pinpoint the demon's presence.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.050
If she's still alive,
she should have some information for me.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.560
Either way, the demon should be
back here by daybreak.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.310
I'll dispose of it with my own two hands!

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.040
The scent is strong!

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.080
There's no question!

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.250
Miss Koinatsu!

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.880
Are you a Demon Slayer?

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.880
So you came.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.300
How many of you are there?

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.430
I know one is that yellow-haired,
ugly little brat.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.770
Is there a Hashira with you?

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.400
Or will he be here soon?

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.280
I know you're not a Hashira.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.780
You seem weak, after all.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.030
I have no use for anyone
who's not a Hashira.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.660
Got that?

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.160
Her body...

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.740
What's going on?

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.250
I don't see Miss Koinatsu's body.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.460
She's not bleeding.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.420
There's no scent of blood!

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:13.420
I never devour dirty old people or anyone ugly.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.680
UPPER SIX

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.260
Upper...

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.930
Six!

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.890
Let that person go!

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.560
Who do you think you're talking to?
How dare you...

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.330
She's so fast!

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.460
I never saw that coming!

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.290
Upper Rank...

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.170
I have no strength in my limbs.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.300
My body's numb!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.050
Calm down!

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.600
My body's responding fine.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.180
Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive right now!

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.810
I have no strength in my limbs...

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.230
because I'm afraid!

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.320
My body's numb because I hit
my back hard, so no wonder!

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.200
That demon's weapon is her Belt!
It has supernatural abilities!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.750
She can absorb humans inside it!

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.710
That's why no matter how hard
I searched inside the building,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.090
I couldn't find a secret path
that a human could fit through!

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.220
All she needs to abduct humans
is a crack big enough for that Belt!

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.600
Oh, you're still alive?

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.350
You're not as fragile as I thought.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.480
I do like your eyes. They're lovely.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.730
I'll just gouge out your eyeballs
and devour them.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.780
The box!

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.290
It's not broken.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.910
But the next time she attacks me,
it's sure to be destroyed!

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.050
Sorry, Nezuko.
The shoulder strap broke.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.010
I can't carry you while I fight!

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.340
Don't you leave that box.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.850
Unless your life is in danger.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.690
Water Breathing...

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.440
Fourth Form!

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.030
Striking Tide... Turbulent!

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.690
Your midair moves weren't half bad.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.820
Also...

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.950
you certainly did a fine job separating her.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.910
Right where I'd trapped Koinatsu.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.920
I mean, how cute is that?
As ugly as you are!

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:46.140
I'm starting to get rather fond of you.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.430
You're like a rat on the brink of death.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.440
Upper Six.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.060
Can I do it?

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.360
Without Uzui, Zenitsu or Inosuke...

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.950
Can I take on an Upper Rank alone?

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.820
No.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.450
It's not a matter of if I can do it!

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.790
I have to do it!

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020
NIN-NIN

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.060
Nin-nin!

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.320
Thanks for your hard work, you three!

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.150
Muscle!

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.610
Who the heck are these guys?

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.610
They're Ninju.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.610
The Muscular Mice!

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.240
They go into cramped spaces
where we wouldn't fit...

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.990
Muscle!

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.160
...and help slay demons behind the scenes.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.120
Muscle! Muscle!

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.870
You could say they are
the Shadow Demon Slayer Corps.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.460
And now, time for a Taisho-era secret!

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:26.010
We took care to assemble only the most
dedicated mice to train as the Muscular Mice,

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.930
but being narcissistic enough to fall in love
with their own muscles is also a must.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.050
In other words, they have to have
a flair for flashiness.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.970
Next, Episode 5,
"Things Are Gonna Get Real Flashy!!"

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.980
Muscle!

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.060
TO BE CONTINUED

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.060
These guys have mad skills.
