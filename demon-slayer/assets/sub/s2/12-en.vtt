WEBVTT

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.790
Hinatsuru!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.010
EPISODE 5:
THINGS ARE GONNA GET REAL FLASHY!!

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.190
Forgive me, Lord Tengen.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.860
Never mind. Stop talking.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.150
I realized that Warabihime Oiran
was a demon,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.200
but she became suspicious of me, as well.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.200
So I drank some poison
and tried to slip out of the House.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.290
But it seems this Belt that I was given by
Warabihime Oiran was for spying on and killing me.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.960
So I was unable to contact you.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.470
Lord Tengen, do not trouble yourself
with me. Please go now.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.470
You heard that sound
just now, did you not?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.980
The demon is on a rampage.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.110
You're sure you're going to be all right?

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.480
Yes.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.360
I am sorry I couldn't be of use to you.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.370
There's no need for you
to do anything more.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.790
Once the antidote starts working,
leave Yoshiwara.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.870
You hear me?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.130
Yes.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.140
The battle has already begun.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.560
Where is it?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.640
Search for its presence!

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.940
It's here. Underground!

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.360
I can hear the sound of someone battling.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.160
I can hear it well thanks to the reverberations.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.870
There's something here!

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.120
Sound Breathing...

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.960
First Form...

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.750
Roar!

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.930
UPPER SIX

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.050
What an infernal racket,
you piece of trash!

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.930
What is that sound?
What are you doing?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.220
Where?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.510
From the Ogimoto House?

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.310
And also Hinatsuru...

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.020
How many of you are here?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.020
Four?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.610
I'm not telling you!

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.360
If you tell me the truth,
I'd be willing to spare your life.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.120
We clashed for maybe an instant,
but look at your sword!

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.950
It's already nicked.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.210
Some hack of a swordsmith
must've forged that blade, am I right?

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.330
You're wrong!

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.340
The person who forged
this sword is amazing!

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.630
He's a brilliant swordsmith!

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.300
Then how did it get nicked, moron?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.810
It's starting to get noisy
all over the place.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.810
It's annoying me,
so this time, I'm going to kill you.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.940
The blade gets nicked
when its wielder is subpar.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.980
It's my fault!

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.030
I...

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.570
When all is said and done, I...

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.660
can't handle...

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.080
the Water Breathing technique!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.170
My body's not suited for Water Breathing!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.920
I can't become like Urokodaki or Tomioka
with the Water Breathing technique!

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.590
In my case...

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.390
I just can't help striking harder
with the Hinokami Kagura.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.890
It's just compatible with my body!

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.390
But...

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.820
Would it kill you
to hold back a little, idiot?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.650
That would be no way to train!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.280
Hinokami Kagura!

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.910
Huh?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.330
Flame Dance!

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.660
Clear Blueâ€”

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.170
Tanjiro!

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.500
Tanjiro! Are you okay?

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.800
What? Are you hungry?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.130
- Dummy!
- Huh?

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.970
- Boar!
- Huh?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.970
Because of its sheer force...

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.590
I couldn't unleash multiple strikes.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.470
Hang in there! I'll go fetch Shinobu!

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.600
It's different now!

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.350
I should be able to do it!

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.730
No!

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.730
I'm doing it!

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.560
That's what I've been training for!

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.190
Don't go down in defeat! Ablaze!

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.610
Ablaze! Ablaze!

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.320
Set your heart ablaze!

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.490
Hinokami Kagura...

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.330
Raging Sun!

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.250
His swordsmanship style just changed!

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.000
It's sharper than before.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.710
What the hell is this sound?

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.430
Such an unpleasant sound!
The sound of breathing?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.220
Flame Dance!

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.930
Flame Dance is a two-hit strike!
Even if she dodges it, there's one more!

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.100
That was nothing to write home about.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100
In the end, this is all it amounts to!

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.070
Where is he?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.740
Hinokami Kagura...

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.400
Fake Rainbow...

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.450
An opening! The Opening Thread!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.870
I can do this!

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.580
Hinokami Kagura...

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:19.910
Fire Wheel!

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.670
So slow. You're making me yawn.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.420
Go on the defensive!

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.590
Defensive!

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.110
This is the fallout
from using the Hinokami Kagura!

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.240
All that built-up fatigue
is making my muscles tighten up!

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.110
Oh, so you're still alive?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.950
Calm down.

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.410
Get your breathing under control!

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.450
Recover!

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.790
Hurry!

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.460
Recovery Breathing!

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.970
This Belt is like a powerful blade!

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.970
Even if I glimpse an Opening Thread,
it vanishes just like that!

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.850
My attacks are too slow!

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.900
Raise your body temperature!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.650
Get your body temperature up!

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.190
I'm going to inform
Lady Shinobu, all right?

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.860
That your temperature
still hasn't gone down!

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.120
Kiyo, please! I'm begging you!

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.370
Keep it between us! I'm fine, okay?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.620
But...

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.410
I'm feeling fine, see?

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.750
I'm fine! Never felt better!

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.420
Just look at this thermometer!

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.630
100.4 degrees!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.630
Just like yesterday
and the day before that, remember?

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.380
It's been like that for days!

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.890
Uh...

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.770
If you have a fever that won't go down,
that means something's wrong!

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.860
I have no idea what I should do about it!

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.230
Only Lady Shinobu would know!

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.030
The thing is...

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.240
when I have a fever,
I'm at the top of my game!

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.330
I can unleash
multiple Hinokami Kagura strikes!

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.620
I might become even stronger!

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.630
Can't you wait just a little longer
before telling Lady Shinobu?

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.210
Just a little longer!

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.760
Just a little bit!

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.140
Very well.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.470
But just a little longer, okay?

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.190
I can feel my temperature...

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.360
my body heat rising!

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.940
I'm able to fight...

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.190
an Upper Rank Demon!

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.070
You're a pesky one.
More than I thought you'd be.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.780
This is entertaining.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.700
I can do it!

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.200
Hinokami Kagura's effective!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.120
No! It's not enough for it be effective!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.290
I have to win!

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.170
Using every ounce of my power!

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.050
I'm gonna win, no matter what!

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.550
To protect them.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.350
To protect lives!

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:23.970
Never again.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.140
I won't let them be robbed for no reason.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.890
Never again!

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.150
I won't let anyone...

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.570
suffer the same grief that we did!

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:44.030
You ugly people are still ugly,
even when you try so hard!

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.380
OGIMOTO HOUSE

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.380
SOMEWHAT EARLIER

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.470
What's going on?

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.890
It's a monster! A monster!

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.140
Hey, go get ready for work!

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.440
There's a monster boar
that's demolishing the ceilings and the floors!

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.150
Huh?

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.940
How is that even possible?

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.150
Then come with me!

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.620
I'm totally feeling the demon's presence!

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.170
Is it here?

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.670
Found it!

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.470
The hole leading to the demon's lair!

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.550
Get ready to die!

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.430
Ugh!

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.100
So I can only get my head inside, huh?

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.980
Nice try! That won't work
on Lord Inosuke!

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.490
I'm a man who can dislocate all his joints!

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.660
In other words, as long as my head fits,
there's nowhere that I can't go!

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.130
Comin' through! No one can stop me!

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.130
Freakin' long! This is no game trail!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.130
A demon!

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.760
There's a demon here!

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.640
What the heck is this?

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.370
Huh? A cloth with a human pattern?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.000
What is this?

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.870
No, this feels like...

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.670
those are living humans.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.920
So it traps humans
inside a woman's belly band, huh?

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.260
Damn. Then it takes them out
whenever it wants, and devours them?

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.020
Pretty savage, if you ask me.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:18.310
What's he doing here?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.940
No, what are you doing?

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.450
Barging in on someone else's food locker...

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.320
So dirty!

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.200
How dirty you are!

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.450
Dirty!

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.790
Smelly! You damn stinkbug!

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.790
What did you say, you worm? So gross!

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.710
Why, you damn stinkbug!

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.090
Wriggle, wriggle, wriggle, wriggle!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.880
You're really grossing me out, Worm Belt!

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.180
Look how sluggish you are!

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.720
You got greedy
and swallowed up too many humans!

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.600
An attack by an overweight worm...

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.360
will never land on Lord Inosuke!

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.980
Grow a spine...

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.980
and don't come back until you're ready!

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.370
Damn! He managed to slice me
without touching the humans!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.540
After I went to the trouble
of storing all that fresh food!

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.370
His intuition is razor-sharp!

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.960
Especially his ability to detect
murderous intent is extraordinary!

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.540
So sensitive...

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.380
he can perceive attacks
from any direction and dodge them!

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.890
I never expected a Demon Slayer
to infiltrate the food locker.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.510
What should I do?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.810
Capture him alive.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.810
UPPER SIX

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.110
He's the one who got in my way
when I captured Makio.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.770
He was beautiful.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:50.160
Except for the ten most beautiful,
you can kill the humans you've stored.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.990
Though it might prove harder
to capture them alive than to merely kill them...

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.250
Devour some of the ones there
and strengthen your body.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.050
I can't slash it!
Because it's bending like that?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.850
Beast Breathing, Sixth Fang...

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.100
Palisade Bite!

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.360
It won't do any good to slash me.
I'm not the main body.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:32.240
Never mind that. You're leaving the humans
you saved in the lurch. Is that what you want?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.330
Whatever you do to me,
I can get it back in a flash!

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.840
Oh, crap! I have to fight it
while protecting those humans!

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.590
Dammit!

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.800
I can't keep up!

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.630
You damn Worm Belt!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:55.680
You came up with a great name!
"Worm Belt"!

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.770
It really is gross!

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.770
You're absolutely right!

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.480
I'm so going to tell Lord Tengen on you!

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.810
We're going to give you a hand...

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.360
so fight the good fight, Boar Head!

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.070
Who the heck are you?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.360
We're Uzui's wives!

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.120
I'm not much of a fighter!

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.330
So please don't get your hopes up!

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.170
Suma! Don't be such a wimp!

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.630
But... But... Makio, you know
I'm a good-for-nothing!

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.420
I mean, I got captured right away!
It's too much to ask of me!

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.760
Protecting everyone who got caught!
I'm the most liable to die first!

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.520
That's right! How astute you are!

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.270
Now then, which one of you should I eat first?

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.600
Damn that thing!
It's not the main body?

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.980
If that's true, I'm screwed!
This battle's never gonna end!

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.860
Thunder Breathing...

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:53.990
First Form...

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.200
Thunderclap and Flash.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.620
Sixfold.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.840
Maybe you should stay asleep
the whole time.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.970
THE ONES WHO DELIVERED
ZENITSU'S SWORD

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.970
- Muscle!
- Muscle!

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.720
Is that kid a Demon Slayer, too?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.430
Why is he dressed like an idiot?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.060
I have no idea!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:31.570
Hey! The next one's coming! Move!

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.940
Who is that boy?

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.770
Such blistering speed!

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.570
No, forget that.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.320
Didn't I just hear two sounds?

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.280
A noise like overlapping thunderbolts,
creating two sounds.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.530
One was that boy.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.040
The other one...

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.580
came from above?

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.800
The wind?

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.420
Did an air hole open up?

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.850
What can you do from aboveground
to create a hole all the way down here?

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.680
What the hell?

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.390
He's here.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.730
Someone just came inside.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.940
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.200
This presence!

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.910
A Hashira!

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:38.720
Lord Tengen...

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.970
DESTROY

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.310
Makio...

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.970
Suma...

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.180
Sorry I took so long.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.480
It's a relief to see you looking good!

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.860
He wasn't like this before.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.660
The thought of dying didn't bother me.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.200
Since that was how I was trained.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.870
Because I was a shinobi.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.250
Especially since a kunoichi could never hope
to match a male shinobi in terms of strength.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.260
Staking my life was something
I only needed minimal effort to do.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.600
I want you three
to only think about your own lives.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.270
Above all else, your top priority
is to come back to me.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.770
Life over accomplishing your mission!

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:39.610
What I'm saying is at odds with this occupation,
but it doesn't matter. I'm allowing it!

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.990
The order that lives should go in
is flashy and clear-cut in my mind.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.910
First, you three.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.920
Second, law-abiding citizens.

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.330
And finally, me.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.720
As a Demon Slayer, it goes without saying that I'll also
protect the public leading their nonchalant, drab lives...

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.050
but to be blunt in my flashy way,
you three are more important to me.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.970
So don't die on me.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.230
Is it really okay to go around saying that?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:16.480
If you put your own life first, you can't get
much serious work done. Is that okay?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.490
I think it's okay.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:23.490
If Lord Tengen says he's fine with it.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.080
Not wanting to die
or wanting to go on living...

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.500
I'm sure it's not wrong
to feel that way, either.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.460
As long as you don't despise yourself,
it should be fine.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.000
I'm sure.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.800
You're right.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.150
I see that you've been doing
some flashy work.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
You're my wives, all right!

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:17.000
All right!

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.050
Starting now,
things are going to get real flashy!

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.770
NIN-NIN

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.020
Nin-nin!

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.480
The Sound Hashira
can't possibly have three wives!

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.700
Well, why don't you try
for that, too, Zenitsu?

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.740
What? Really?

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.490
Okay, then, there's Yoshiko, Sanae,
and then there'sâ€”

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.120
I have to let Nezuko know.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.620
Tanjiro!

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.410
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.250
Uzui's family practices polygamy,
and I hear that when you turn 15,

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.590
the head of the family picks out three wives
who are sure to be compatible.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.880
But they say Suma stepped forward herself.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.010
Maybe I should become a shinobi, too!

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.850
Then you'll be starting
shinobi training today, right?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:34.640
Huh?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.020
Nooooo!

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.730
Next, Episode 6, "Layered Memories."

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.020
TO BE CONTINUED
