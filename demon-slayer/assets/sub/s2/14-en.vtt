00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
UPPER SIX

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.990
EPISODE 7:
TRANSFORMATION

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.050
Why is the leg that I chopped off
piercing my back?

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.390
You regenerated it instantaneously?

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.550
No way!

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.310
That would make
your regenerative powers...

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.480
greater than mine!

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.950
Big Bro!

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.250
Big Bro!

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.880
Help her!

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.420
Or our sister...

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.550
won't ever be herself anymore!

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.440
Get off me, you little brat!

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.280
I'm going to chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you into my Belt!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.710
She stopped it?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.000
With her severed limbs?

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.760
No, they're not severed.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.760
Her blood congealed.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.310
It's burning me! The blood spatter!

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.810
Just like that day!

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.350
Fire...

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.570
Fire!

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.830
Nezuko!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.580
Stop it! Stop it!

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.670
Stop it! You have to tough it out, Nezuko!

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.220
I'm sorry! I'm sorry I made you fight!

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.480
I can smell Nezuko's blood
all over the place!

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.440
I can tell just how badly she was wounded
while I was passed out!

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.530
It hurt, didn't it? I know you suffered!
I'm sorry! But it's all right now!

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.530
I won't let anyone hurt you anymore!

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.540
Go to sleep, Nezuko!
Go to sleep and heal yourself!

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.710
Nezuko!

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.210
Nezuâ€”

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.720
What...

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.140
Someone burst through from below!

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.260
Nezuâ€”

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.220
Go to sleep!

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.020
Really, such nerve doing that to me.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.450
So, you can use Blood Demon Art, too?

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.160
A bizarre Blood Demon Art
that only burns demons?

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.740
Not only that, but it's taking
forever for me to heal.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.210
This irritates me
like you wouldn't believe!

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.920
Like you wouldn't believe!

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:23.670
This is bad!

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.420
There are people here!
I have to protect them!

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800
Think!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.340
Think and take action!

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.430
The attack will come any second now!

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.680
The whole building will get slashed!

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.220
Do I dare let go of Nezuko?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.060
No! What should I do?

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.190
The bystanders will get hurt again!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.480
DESTROY

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.480
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.660
Hey!

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.620
Isn't this Nezuko Kamado?

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.750
I see she's becoming a flashy demon.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.170
Uzui...

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:10.380
After all that grandstanding
in front of the Master, what's this sorry state?

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.680
No one ever told her
to become a flashy demon!

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.390
You're a Hashira, right?

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.060
You came to me?

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.060
You just made it easy for me.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.400
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.690
Get lost.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.440
You're no Upper Rank demon.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.070
Since you're too weak.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.070
You're not the one
I've been searching for.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.830
What kind of ridiculous drivelâ€”

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.000
Huh?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.510
Dammit!

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.520
We lost sight of the God of Festivals!

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.020
At this rate, we'll be overtaken!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.440
Overtaken in a flashy way!

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.530
Hey, you spotted him?

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.210
Mountain God, Lord Inosuke,
is comin' through!

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.220
B-Beheaded...

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.470
Beheaded!

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.640
Her head fell off!

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.470
Was it Uzui who did that?

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.480
Unbelievable!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.480
Hey!

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.020
The battle's not over yet.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.980
Get your sister under control.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.990
Nezuko!

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.290
Stupid brats who start acting cranky
don't belong on the battlefield.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.290
Just be unflashy
and sing her a lullaby or something.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.890
It's useless!

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.690
My voice isn't reaching her!

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.520
She's not listening to me at all!

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.020
What am I gonna do...

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.030
Mother?

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.410
Sing her a lullaby or something.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.910
Hushabye...

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.670
Baby bunny on the hill...

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.420
Tell me why your ears are so very long...

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.170
Because when my mother
was expecting me, sheâ€”

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.890
...dined on long leaves from a tree...

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:15.190
And that is why my ears are so very long...

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.250
Nezuko...

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.710
Nezuko...

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.300
Hushabye...

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.770
Baby bunny on the hill...

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.900
Tell me why your eyes are so very red...

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:07.620
Because when my mother was expecting me,
she dined on red berries from a tree...

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:14.750
And that is why my eyes are so very red...

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.170
So my brother's eyes are red
because when he was inside your tummy,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.760
you ate red berries?

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.830
Nezuko...

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.940
She's asleep.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.690
Mother, she's asleep!

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.780
She fell asleep!

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.200
Uzui!

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.620
Hey, come back here!

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.240
Where do you think you're going?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.240
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.370
I can't believe you had the gall to behead me!
You're going to pay for this, you hear me?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.210
Are you still whining and moaning?

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.880
I have no use for you anymore.
Just die an unflashy death.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.670
Don't give me that!

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.100
In the first place, you said
I wasn't an Upper Rank, didn't you?

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.680
Because you can't be an Upper Rank.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.980
I'm Upper Six, I'll have you know!

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.980
Then, why is your head in your hands?
That's beyond weak!

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.730
Did your brain matter explode or what?

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.070
I haven't lost yet, all right?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.400
Because I'm an Upper Rank!

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.740
But you've lost. It's totally obvious.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.950
I'm really powerful, you know!

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:14.870
Right now, I'm still Number 6,
but I'm going to get even strongerâ€”

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.870
Not buying it!

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.180
I really am Upper Six! I'm telling the truth!

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.260
I have the number to prove it, too!

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.680
I'm amazing, you hear me?

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.350
She's throwing a tantrum?
You've got to be kidding me!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.730
No, wait!
Is she ever going to stop talking?

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.860
Her body's not disintegrating
even after being beheaded!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.650
Die!

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.820
Die!

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.820
All of you can just die!

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.620
He cut my head off! He cut my head off!

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.880
Brother!

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.690
Come on, there's no use crying.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.070
Can't you even reattach
your own head by yourself?

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:34.700
You sure aren't the sharpest tool
in the shed, are you?

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.870
She didn't die even after I beheaded her!

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.830
Who's that other one
that emerged from her back?

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.460
His reflexes are beyond belief!

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.170
Is that a burn on your face?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.920
Look here.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.970
You need to take care of your face,

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.970
since you were born
with such a pretty face.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.390
UPPER SIX

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.150
Huh. Not bad.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.650
You stopped my attack, didn't you?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.910
Even though I was going for the kill.
Good for you, man.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.500
Good for you.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.250
Lucky you, man.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.040
That face of yours... Nice.

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.000
I like your skin, too.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.130
Not a blemish, birthmark
or scar to be seen, huh?

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.510
And you have some meat
on your bones, too.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.470
I can't gain weight, no matter what.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:42.180
You're a tall guy, too!
I can see you're well over six feet tall!

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:47.360
You must get tons of attention
from the ladies, don't you?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.320
I envy you!

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.280
How I envy you!

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.900
Would you mind just dropping dead?

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.410
In the most agonizing way at that!

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.620
Like getting skinned alive
or maybe getting your belly slit open!

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.000
And one more thingâ€”

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.790
Brother!

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.380
It's not just him! There is more!

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.260
Kill the one who burned me, too!
Promise me!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.630
I've been toiling away, and yet...

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.800
I've really been giving it my all!
All by myself!

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.930
And yet, everyone got in my way
and bullied me!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.650
They all ganged up on me and bullied me!

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:33.400
I see! I see!
That's unforgivable for sure!

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.280
My sweet little sister was doing her best
with what little brains she had.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.290
So I'll massacre everyone
who had the nerve to bully her.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.920
Time to exact it. That's my way.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.000
I'll exact the same damage
you inflicted on me for sure.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.090
You're going to spin round and round
when you die.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.260
Because my name is Gyutaro!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.390
UPPER SIX

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.270
What are those? Sickles?

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.780
The sickles are spinning and heading back.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.860
Not the same weapon as the Belt Demon's.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.570
What's going on?

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.820
Is it a new demon?

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.080
I can smell Uzui's blood!

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.450
I have to back him up!

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.830
I'm here now, dammit!

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.080
Inosuke has arrived, dumbass!

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.330
Depend on me! On yours truly!

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.590
Inosuke! Zenitsu!

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.880
Zenitsu, are you asleep?

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.760
Both of you, go back up Uzui! Please!

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.100
Just relax and leave it to me, dammit!

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.270
I'm ready to go berserk!

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.890
Yours truly!

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.520
Lord Inosuke!

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.520
In a real flashy way, too!

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.610
Sorry! I'm going to go
put Nezuko back into her box!

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.820
So just give me a second, okay?

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:55.730
Granted!

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.440
Thanks!

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.540
How envious I am...

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:10.830
You really are a good-looking guy, aren't you?

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.290
Protecting those humans...

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.460
Showing off like that...

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.840
I envy you.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:23.300
In their eyes,
you're their savior, aren't you?

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:29.020
I bet their affection and gratitude toward you
know no bounds, huh?

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.900
Well, yeah.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.730
I'm a flashy, glamorous ladies' man,
so that's a no-brainer.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.780
And I even have three wives no less.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.280
Did you just say you had three wives?

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.910
Are you kidding me?

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.500
That's unforgivable!

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.670
Blood Demon Art...

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.420
Flying Blood Sickles!

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.590
Slashes of blood like thin blades!

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.260
And this many of them! I can't handle them all
while protecting these people!

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.850
What was that? An explosion...

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.850
He dropped down to the first floor, huh?

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.480
Run! Find a place to hide!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.310
R-Right!

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.320
You're not getting away!

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.820
Bend. Flying Blood Sickles.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.000
So he can control the slashes themselves?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.960
Blood slashes that keep moving
until they hit their target and explode!

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.750
Those siblings...

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.710
The sister didn't die
even after she was decapitated!

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.460
That's just unreal!

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.220
Can I destroy them both
if I behead the brother instead?

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.470
Is the brother the main unit?

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.230
Either way, I just have to do it!

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.440
From what I can hear,
most of the people upstairs have fled!

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.160
Ugh! Look out!

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.670
Well, I can tell it's not going to be
a walk in the park.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.880
The thing about us...

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:30.010
is that we're two people in one!

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
NIN-NIN

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.230
Nin-nin!

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.860
Today, we're starting off
with a Taisho-era secret!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.650
Ever since she was a child,
Nezuko's been an angel.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.200
She's never been unreasonable
in her life, either.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.870
Even when our grandmother died...

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.080
and when our father died...

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.120
she always told our younger siblings
the same thing.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.840
"Since neither our grandmother nor our father
can rest easy if we're always crying...

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.090
let's just cry our eyes out today
and then be strong. Let's keep smiling, okay?"

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.760
That's what she would say.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.510
Next, Episode 8, "Gathering."

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.350
Really, Nezuko's the best!

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.020
