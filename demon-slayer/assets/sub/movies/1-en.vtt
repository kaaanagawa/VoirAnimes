Hideki...

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:49.673

00:01:06.857 --> 00:01:07.817
Takahiro...

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.748
Master, we should go.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.334
It's not good for your health.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:32.633
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.643
I'd like to settle the score
for these children

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.021
who died while I'm in charge.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:56.073
I've already received seven cases
caused by demons this month.

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:02.746
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:08.586
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.050
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:22.558
the one thing they can never crush
is a human's will.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.061
No matter how battered we are,

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:31.150
we will always rise up again to fight.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:23.744
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:28.415
Are the police still around?

00:03:28.457 --> 00:03:30.251
We'll have to go even if they are.

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:35.172
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.424
Hey, idiot!

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.050
We should go, too!

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:41.262
Hey, don't leave me behind!

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:46.308
W-Wait up!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.770
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:51.105
Zenitsu!

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:08.205
So fast!

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.332
Sorry! We're very sorry!

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:12.960
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:14.211
So freakin' fast!

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.137
Ma'am, is that all right?

00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:24.972
Thank you.

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:26.432
Sorry to trouble you.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:27.224
Oh no.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.810
It's the least I can do.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.572
He's a Hashira, right?

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:43.199
This Rengoku person...

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.452
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:47.578
Sure.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.582
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:52.875
Hey!

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.294
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.047
Delicious!

00:05:30.704 --> 00:05:31.705
Delicious!

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:33.374
Delicious!

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:35.376
Delicious!

00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:39.380
Delicious!

00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:41.966
Delicious!

00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.469
Delicious!

00:05:47.304 --> 00:05:48.055
Delicious!

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:50.474
Delicious!

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.726
Delicious!

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:55.980
Delicious!

00:05:58.357 --> 00:05:59.233
Delicious!

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.485
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

00:06:01.527 --> 00:06:02.778
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:04.572
Not just some random glutton?

00:06:04.613 --> 00:06:06.240
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:07.658
Delicious!

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.994
Um, excuse me...

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:11.787
Delicious!

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:13.456
R-Rengoku?

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:15.291
Delicious!

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:19.545
Uh, we really get that part already.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.305
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

00:06:29.597 --> 00:06:30.389
Yes.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.183
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.063
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

00:06:38.397 --> 00:06:42.109
I see. And inside that box there...

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:43.319
Yes.

00:06:43.652 --> 00:06:45.404
It's my sister Nezuko.

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:49.033
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:53.496
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.751
Have a seat here.

00:07:05.674 --> 00:07:08.469
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.181
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.850
What are you three doing here?

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:16.685
A mission?

00:07:16.977 --> 00:07:19.105
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:25.694
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.281
Yes! I see now! Understood!

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:30.449
Right.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:33.494
Also, there's one more thing.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.664
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.625
What is it? Let's hear it.

00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:42.336
About my father...

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.380
What about your father?

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:47.049
Well, he was really frail.

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:48.426
Was he really?

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:51.846
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:53.556
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

00:07:53.597 --> 00:07:54.890
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:58.269
The thing is...

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.311
What's up?

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.439
Hinokami Kagura...

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:02.982
Dance!

00:08:04.024 --> 00:08:07.862
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:11.782
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.160
I was hoping you'd tell me.

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.624
Right!

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.043
But I know nothing!

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:27.256
I've never even heard
the term "Hinokami Dance" before.

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:32.887
But it's truly commendable that your father
was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.264
All right, end of discussion!

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:37.349
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:41.145
You should become my Tsuguko,
my apprentice! I'll look after you!

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:44.857
Hold on a second!
And just what are you looking at?

00:08:45.816 --> 00:08:47.777
<i>He's totally weird, all right.</i>

00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:50.404
Flame Breathing has a long history.

00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:56.035
In any given era, there's always been a Flame
and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:57.495
Flame.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:58.788
Water.

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.080
Wind.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.373
Stone.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:04.335
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:08.756
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:12.384
Mist is a fork of Wind.

00:09:13.052 --> 00:09:14.261
Young Mizoguchi!

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:16.388
What color is your sword?

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:20.518
My name's Kamado.
And the color is black.

00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.019
A black sword, huh?

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.063
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.066
For real?

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.694
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:35.074
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.036
Come to me, and I'll train you!

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.830
You can rest easy now!

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.289
No, thank you!

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:44.792
And just what are you looking at?

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.678
<i>He's strange,
but he seems to be very caring.</i>

00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:59.140
<i>And from his scent,
I can pick up his strong sense of justice.</i>

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:05.604
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.274
That's dangerous, you idiot!

00:10:08.315 --> 00:10:12.194
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:15.114
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.868
You never know when a demon might appear.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.374
You're kidding, right?
Demons show up on this train?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.084
Sure do!

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:28.252
What? They do?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:32.923
Nooo! So, we're not heading
to where the demons are, but we're here?

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:34.675
Nooo!

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.469
I'm getting off!

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:42.016
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

00:10:42.349 --> 00:10:46.562
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:49.482
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

00:10:55.362 --> 00:10:59.575
Right, I see!
I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.667
May I...

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.252
see your...

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.129
tickets, please?

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:14.840
What's he doing?

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:18.969
The conductor's going to check
your ticket and punch a hole in it.

00:11:30.397 --> 00:11:31.357
Here.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:56.841
<i>What is this?</i>

00:11:57.466 --> 00:11:59.260
<i>There's a horrible scent.</i>

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.513
Thank you...

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.682
very much.

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.271
Mr. Conductor...

00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:12.398
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:16.902
As this is an emergency,
please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:40.760
Was it a Blood Demon Art
that hid that massive body?

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.220
I had a hard time detecting you.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:48.684
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:55.649
my bright red Flame Blade
will burn you to the bone!

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:02.865
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:04.867
<i>First Form...</i>

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.128
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.515
Amazing.

00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:30.017
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

00:13:33.354 --> 00:13:35.022
There's still one more.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.690
Come with me!

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.985
All right!

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:43.948
D-Don't leave me behind!

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:05.428
You will not lay a finger on that man!

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:12.351
Didn't you hear me?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.271
I said I'm your opponent.

00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:19.733
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:20.860
All right!

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.154
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.197
We gotta save the passenger first!

00:14:25.239 --> 00:14:27.783
It won't matter
once I destroy that thing!

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.259
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:48.679
We're good to go now.

00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:50.681
Let's finish him off in short order.

00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:00.775
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.777
<i>Second Form...</i>

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:08.449
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:29.970
Tha...

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.972
Tha...

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:35.893
That was awesome, Bro!
Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.687
Please make me your apprentice!

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:41.482
Fine by me! I'll make
a fine swordsman out of you!

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.526
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

00:15:43.901 --> 00:15:46.028
I'll train all of you!

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.989
Big Bro Rengoku!

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.449
Bro!

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:52.535
- Bro!
- Bro!

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.412
Big Bro Rengoku!

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.790
I did as I was told! I punched
their tickets and put them to sleep!

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:43.711
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:48.174
Please let me be reunited
with my dead wife and daughter!

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:50.843
I'm begging you.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.137
I'm begging you.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.056
Sure thing.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.313
You did a good job.

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:07.358
Go to sleep.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.741
Have a nice dream
where you can meet your family.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:16.035
Excuse me.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.207
What do you want us to do?

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:26.212
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:28.881
Wait here until then.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:36.013
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up
sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

00:17:36.347 --> 00:17:41.477
When you tie the ropes,
be careful not to touch their bodies.

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.981
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:49.902
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:53.405
so that you can have blissful dreams.

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.574
Okay.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:54.633
<i>What's going on? What happened?</i>

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.266
<i>Calm down.</i>

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:04.143
<i>Calm down.</i>

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.604
<i>You have to calm down.</i>

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:17.990
Hey!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.992
It's Big Bro!

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:22.161
Welcome home, Big Bro!

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:24.079
Did you sell the charcoal?

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:43.766
Big Bro?

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:59.865
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.336
To be able to die while dreaming...

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.880
Just how lucky are you?

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:19.260
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:25.558
A human's driving force
is the heart, the spirit!

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:32.064
All you have to do
is destroy the spiritual core.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:34.442
You can kill them just like that!

00:20:34.775 --> 00:20:37.736
All human hearts are the same.

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:43.951
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:49.165
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

00:20:49.582 --> 00:20:53.502
That's right. Don't forget
what he warned us about.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.847
Take a deep, slow breath...

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.767
while you count.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.772
<i>Do that, and you'll fall asleep.</i>

00:21:13.147 --> 00:21:14.565
<i>One...</i>

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:15.941
<i>Two...</i>

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.610
<i>Three...</i>

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.528
<i>Four...</i>

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.363
<i>Five...</i>

00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.365
<i>Six...</i>

00:21:28.537 --> 00:21:32.833
And then, we were surprised
because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.710
What a weirdo!

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.799
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.177
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

00:21:46.097 --> 00:21:48.766
You don't have a fever, do you?

00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:52.770
Take it easy and get some rest today, okay?

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:54.730
I'm all right.

00:21:54.772 --> 00:21:56.273
Are you sure?

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.818
Hey! You come back here!

00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:01.445
Gotcha!

00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.656
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:07.660
Hey! You stop that right now!

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:09.662
Seems like...

00:22:10.788 --> 00:22:14.458
I was having a bad dream or something.

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:20.423
Falling deeper into sleep,
deep in their dreams...

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:23.801
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

00:22:24.176 --> 00:22:27.555
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:30.891
Even in the stomach,
deep in their dreams...

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:33.978
Looks like fun.

00:22:34.395 --> 00:22:37.565
You're starting to have
a happy dream, aren't you?

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:42.319
You are falling...

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:44.822
You are falling...

00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:47.074
into a dream.

00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.583
It's a deep slumber.

00:22:56.834 --> 00:22:58.085
They can...

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:01.172
no longer awaken.

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.433
This way!

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.560
The peaches over here taste great!

00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:16.937
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

00:23:16.979 --> 00:23:19.064
I'll make you a chaplet!

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.484
I can make these really great-looking ones...

00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:23.152
Nezuko!

00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:25.821
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.199
Zenitsu?

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.501
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:39.752
River?

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:44.006
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.759
I can't swim.

00:23:47.343 --> 00:23:51.764
I-I'll just carry you on my back
and jump right over the river!

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:54.767
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

00:23:57.978 --> 00:24:00.272
Just leave it to me!

00:24:00.815 --> 00:24:02.775
Let's go!

00:24:17.915 --> 00:24:19.834
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:21.710
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:23.629
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:25.464
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

00:24:25.506 --> 00:24:26.966
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:27.800
Boss!

00:24:28.175 --> 00:24:29.051
Boss!

00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:32.805
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:37.476
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:40.980
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:47.486
Here he is!

00:24:47.736 --> 00:24:50.072
All right, let's go! Showdown!

00:24:50.406 --> 00:24:51.949
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:55.536
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:59.790
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.876
Let's go!

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.211
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:33.991
<i>Why did I come here?</i>

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.205
<i>Oh, right.</i>

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:41.707
<i>To report to my father...</i>

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:44.126
<i>that I've become a Hashira.</i>

00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:06.315
So what if you've become a Hashira?

00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:12.113
Worthless.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.781
It means nothing.

00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:17.785
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:20.079
Neither you...

00:26:20.538 --> 00:26:22.289
nor I.

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:29.713
Brother...

00:26:31.507 --> 00:26:34.760
Was our father pleased to hear your news?

00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:41.016
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

00:26:43.978 --> 00:26:46.063
<i>He wasn't always like that.</i>

00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:50.651
<i>After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.</i>

00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:53.529
<i>He was a passionate man.</i>

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:57.867
<i>And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.</i>

00:26:58.909 --> 00:27:00.244
<i>Suddenly.</i>

00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:05.708
<i>The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...</i>

00:27:09.545 --> 00:27:10.755
<i>Why?</i>

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:16.719
<i>It's pointless to think
about such things, so stop.</i>

00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:20.973
<i>Senjuro is even worse off.</i>

00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:26.771
<i>He barely has any memories of our mother
who died of illness when he was very young,</i>

00:27:26.812 --> 00:27:29.231
<i>and just look at the state our father is in.</i>

00:27:34.403 --> 00:27:35.821
I'm going to be honest.

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:39.283
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.952
He told me that it meant nothing.

00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:46.207
But that's not enough
to extinguish my passion!

00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:49.460
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.463
I'll never give in!

00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:54.465
And Senjuro...

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:59.220
You're not like me.

00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.680
You have a big brother...

00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:04.725
who believes in his little brother.

00:28:05.351 --> 00:28:09.563
No matter what path you take,
you're going to become a fine human being!

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.982
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:13.192
Let's do our best!

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.402
Let's do our best and live on!

00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:17.696
No matter how lonely it gets.

00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.413
Looking good.

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.833
Those ropes that I created are used...

00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:33.295
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:38.634
I always fight with the utmost caution.

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:43.973
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

00:28:44.682 --> 00:28:50.354
I'll enjoy the feast
after killing the Demon Slayers.

00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:00.906
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

00:29:01.699 --> 00:29:03.159
Relax your shoulders.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:05.703
Like this?

00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:06.996
That's right.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:10.916
Close call. He's right there.

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:13.961
<i>I have to make sure he doesn't see me!</i>

00:29:15.588 --> 00:29:17.548
<i>I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!</i>

00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:19.467
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:29:21.385 --> 00:29:24.680
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.351
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:37.234
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside
the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

00:29:38.736 --> 00:29:40.696
That's what you must destroy.

00:29:41.739 --> 00:29:46.452
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:54.960
There it is!

00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:59.465
The scenery doesn't end here,
but you can't go any further.

00:30:02.676 --> 00:30:05.805
<i>I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!</i>

00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:12.603
<i>And then, I'll get to see
a happy dream myself!</i>

00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.698
<i>What an odd realm of the subconscious.</i>

00:30:25.282 --> 00:30:26.408
<i>It's hot.</i>

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.952
<i>It's burning up.</i>

00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.246
<i>I have to hurry.</i>

00:30:46.846 --> 00:30:47.805
Found it!

00:30:48.139 --> 00:30:49.849
The spiritual core!

00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:54.103
I've never seen a red one before.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.359
All I have to do is destroy this and...

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:02.153
It'll be my turn to...

00:31:25.468 --> 00:31:31.098
<i>I thought humans couldn't move
while they were under a spell.</i>

00:31:34.977 --> 00:31:37.938
<i>What a strong survival instinct he has!</i>

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:49.366
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

00:31:49.617 --> 00:31:51.035
Wow!

00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:54.371
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:56.832
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

00:31:57.208 --> 00:32:01.629
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

00:32:01.962 --> 00:32:04.090
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:07.051
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

00:32:07.384 --> 00:32:09.011
Can you get the grill ready for me?

00:32:09.053 --> 00:32:10.596
Okay!

00:32:10.888 --> 00:32:12.890
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:15.601
Okay, I'll be in charge
of flipping them over, then!

00:32:15.643 --> 00:32:17.061
Me, too!

00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:19.688
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.398
No fair!

00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:36.831
There.

00:32:37.706 --> 00:32:40.042
Nezuko, let's go.

00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:50.386
What did I just say?

00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:54.557
I'm back!

00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:58.185
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:00.354
Yeah, I'm home!

00:33:02.398 --> 00:33:03.983
Welcome home, Big Bro!

00:33:07.194 --> 00:33:09.113
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

00:33:09.447 --> 00:33:12.116
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

00:33:13.242 --> 00:33:14.535
In broad daylight?

00:33:17.037 --> 00:33:18.456
She's not supposed to?

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:20.875
Well...

00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:22.334
Um...

00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:23.544
Tanjiro...

00:33:23.878 --> 00:33:25.629
Could you get the bath ready?

00:33:25.963 --> 00:33:28.466
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:34.013
<i>I keep saying all these strange things.</i>

00:33:35.264 --> 00:33:36.891
Am I tired maybe?

00:33:43.606 --> 00:33:45.900
Huh? It's gone.

00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:50.488
I wonder what that was
for just a split second.

00:33:51.155 --> 00:33:52.323
A toolbox perhaps?

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.454
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

00:34:01.373 --> 00:34:02.166
Wake up!

00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:06.670
Wake up!

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:11.759
Wake up!

00:34:12.217 --> 00:34:13.594
You're under attack!

00:34:13.928 --> 00:34:14.844
It's a dream!

00:34:15.096 --> 00:34:16.304
This is a dream!

00:34:16.347 --> 00:34:17.514
Wake up now!

00:34:18.516 --> 00:34:20.851
<i>I see... That's right, I'm...</i>

00:34:22.436 --> 00:34:24.021
<i>on board the train!</i>

00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:25.856
Wake up and fight!

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:27.358
Fight!

00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:31.237
Fight!

00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:37.743
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:40.371
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

00:34:40.955 --> 00:34:43.916
Why are you always
taking food away from Big Bro?

00:34:43.958 --> 00:34:45.333
What's your problem?

00:34:45.376 --> 00:34:47.210
You just had seconds!

00:34:50.089 --> 00:34:53.467
<i>No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!</i>

00:34:54.009 --> 00:34:55.761
<i>How can I get out of it?</i>

00:34:55.803 --> 00:34:57.972
<i>Now that I've realized that it's a dream...</i>

00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:00.975
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

00:35:18.784 --> 00:35:20.536
I have to wake up...

00:35:58.532 --> 00:35:59.700
Big Bro!

00:35:59.742 --> 00:36:01.869
- What should we do? The fire is—
- Big Bro!

00:36:04.914 --> 00:36:06.457
<i>That's Nezuko's scent!</i>

00:36:07.249 --> 00:36:09.210
<i>It's Nezuko's blood!</i>

00:36:10.252 --> 00:36:11.712
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:36:12.004 --> 00:36:12.963
<i>Nezuko!</i>

00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:18.844
<i>My uniform...</i>

00:36:19.178 --> 00:36:20.304
<i>My Nichirin Sword...</i>

00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:22.515
<i>I'm waking up!</i>

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.141
<i>Little by little.</i>

00:36:24.517 --> 00:36:25.810
<i>Little by little!</i>

00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:27.645
Big Bro?

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:29.814
Big Bro, are you all right?

00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:31.065
Big Bro?

00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:33.109
Sorry.

00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:34.819
I have to go.

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:41.700
<i>I have to hurry back!</i>

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.662
I'm sorry.

00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:46.038
Big Bro!

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.832
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

00:36:54.171 --> 00:36:57.049
<i>If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...</i>

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.010
<i>I have to find him
and slash him right away!</i>

00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:04.056
<i>Where is he? I have to...</i>

00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:08.602
Where are you going, Big Bro?

00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:19.488
I picked lots of vegetables today!

00:37:23.868 --> 00:37:25.661
Mom! This way!

00:37:25.953 --> 00:37:28.664
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

00:37:31.542 --> 00:37:33.002
Mom?

00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:35.755
Tanjiro, are you all right?

00:37:36.464 --> 00:37:38.132
Big Bro...

00:37:44.847 --> 00:37:48.684
What's the matter, Tanjiro?
Why are you dressed like that?

00:37:59.904 --> 00:38:01.739
I wish I could stay here...

00:38:02.072 --> 00:38:03.532
forever.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.913
<i>I wish I could turn around and go back.</i>

00:38:10.247 --> 00:38:14.418
<i>By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.</i>

00:38:15.252 --> 00:38:16.337
<i>Right here.</i>

00:38:18.297 --> 00:38:19.590
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:38:20.424 --> 00:38:22.718
<i>they'd all have been alive and well now.</i>

00:38:24.178 --> 00:38:29.100
<i>And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.</i>

00:38:31.936 --> 00:38:33.521
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:38:34.063 --> 00:38:35.356
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.860
<i>I should be here
making charcoal every day.</i>

00:38:40.903 --> 00:38:43.364
<i>I never would've laid a hand on a sword!</i>

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.285
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:51.705
<i>If none of this had happened...</i>

00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:08.013
<i>But I've lost them now.</i>

00:39:08.556 --> 00:39:10.224
<i>I can never go back!</i>

00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:15.146
Big Bro!

00:39:15.729 --> 00:39:18.149
Don't leave us behind!

00:39:24.488 --> 00:39:25.573
<i>Sorry!</i>

00:39:26.532 --> 00:39:28.200
<i>I'm sorry, Rokuta!</i>

00:39:29.994 --> 00:39:32.830
<i>We can't be together anymore.</i>

00:39:33.914 --> 00:39:38.294
<i>But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?</i>

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.881
<i>I'll be thinking of you all!</i>

00:39:44.675 --> 00:39:47.762
<i>There are lots of things to thank you for.</i>

00:39:48.262 --> 00:39:51.223
<i>Lots of things to be sorry for!</i>

00:39:51.682 --> 00:39:53.601
<i>But I will never forget you!</i>

00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:57.354
<i>No matter what,
my heart will always be with you!</i>

00:39:58.314 --> 00:39:59.356
<i>So, please...</i>

00:40:00.399 --> 00:40:01.859
<i>forgive me!</i>

00:40:08.824 --> 00:40:13.537
I have to destroy
his spiritual core right away.

00:40:32.223 --> 00:40:35.267
<i>So, this is the inside of his heart?</i>

00:40:37.311 --> 00:40:39.772
<i>How can it be so beautiful?</i>

00:40:40.314 --> 00:40:42.274
<i>It's so endlessly vast...</i>

00:40:42.775 --> 00:40:44.068
<i>and...</i>

00:40:45.319 --> 00:40:47.071
<i>also warm.</i>

00:40:57.206 --> 00:41:00.292
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

00:41:02.378 --> 00:41:06.340
What's with this realm
of the subconscious?

00:41:07.925 --> 00:41:11.595
And that creepy naked boar...

00:41:11.929 --> 00:41:14.181
Seriously, this is insane.

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:22.898
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.609
You stupid naked boar!

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.372
It's pitch-dark.

00:41:39.957 --> 00:41:44.086
It's pitch-dark,
and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

00:41:44.128 --> 00:41:47.882
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:53.053
Do I have to grope around
to find his spiritual core?

00:41:53.387 --> 00:41:55.139
You must be kidding me.

00:41:57.808 --> 00:41:58.851
What was that?

00:42:09.028 --> 00:42:13.073
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

00:42:13.407 --> 00:42:16.827
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko.

00:42:19.038 --> 00:42:20.790
I'm so going to kill you.

00:42:22.875 --> 00:42:24.251
Where's Nezuko?

00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:26.045
Wh-Who the heck knows?

00:42:26.087 --> 00:42:29.090
All right, then... Die!

00:42:32.301 --> 00:42:35.763
Nooo!

00:42:40.184 --> 00:42:42.103
They're having trouble, aren't they?

00:42:42.478 --> 00:42:43.979
I wonder why.

00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:48.109
They haven't destroyed
any of the spiritual cores yet.

00:42:49.485 --> 00:42:50.361
Oh well...

00:42:50.945 --> 00:42:54.865
I guess it doesn't matter,
since they're buying me some time.

00:42:58.994 --> 00:42:59.870
<i>Not here.</i>

00:43:00.204 --> 00:43:02.581
<i>But I can smell a demon, even faintly.</i>

00:43:03.207 --> 00:43:04.458
<i>What's this, though?</i>

00:43:04.792 --> 00:43:06.877
<i>It's like there's a film over everything!</i>

00:43:07.461 --> 00:43:10.631
<i>There's a faint demon scent everywhere!</i>

00:43:11.215 --> 00:43:12.883
<i>I can't tell the exact location!</i>

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:14.927
I have to hurry!

00:43:15.469 --> 00:43:17.388
Nezuko's bleeding!

00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:21.642
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

00:43:22.226 --> 00:43:23.561
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:43:25.146 --> 00:43:28.524
<i>Am I unable to use
Total Concentration Breathing now?</i>

00:43:29.525 --> 00:43:32.027
<i>Am I just asleep right now?</i>

00:43:33.487 --> 00:43:35.406
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

00:43:39.827 --> 00:43:41.620
Take up your sword.

00:43:43.247 --> 00:43:46.292
There's something you must cut.

00:43:56.761 --> 00:43:58.596
<i>There's something...</i>

00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:00.973
<i>I must cut.</i>

00:44:02.933 --> 00:44:04.560
<i>There's something I must cut...</i>

00:44:04.977 --> 00:44:06.604
<i>in order to wake up.</i>

00:44:08.272 --> 00:44:09.690
<i>I think I know what it is.</i>

00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:13.486
<i>But what if I'm wrong?</i>

00:44:14.236 --> 00:44:17.740
<i>If what happens in this dream
has an effect on reality, too...</i>

00:44:18.282 --> 00:44:19.742
<i>there'll be no going back.</i>

00:44:22.661 --> 00:44:24.747
<i>Don't hesitate! Do it!</i>

00:44:25.122 --> 00:44:26.373
<i>You have to do it!</i>

00:44:26.624 --> 00:44:29.335
<i>My death in this dream
will lead me to reality!</i>

00:44:29.668 --> 00:44:30.961
<i>In other words...</i>

00:44:32.296 --> 00:44:33.631
<i>what I have to cut is...</i>

00:44:36.634 --> 00:44:39.095
<i>my own neck!</i>

00:44:56.529 --> 00:44:59.240
I'm all right. I'm alive.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.788
Nezuko! Are you okay?

00:45:08.916 --> 00:45:10.334
Nezuko...

00:45:12.002 --> 00:45:13.421
Zenitsu...

00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:15.214
Inosuke...

00:45:15.714 --> 00:45:17.133
Rengoku...

00:45:21.178 --> 00:45:23.305
<i>Who are these people?</i>

00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.809
<i>They're all connected
by the wrists with ropes.</i>

00:45:27.893 --> 00:45:29.478
<i>Rope...</i>

00:45:31.856 --> 00:45:33.149
<i>What's this?</i>

00:45:33.441 --> 00:45:34.859
<i>It's burned off.</i>

00:45:35.192 --> 00:45:37.319
<i>Nezuko's burning blood did it?</i>

00:45:37.903 --> 00:45:40.322
<i>It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!</i>

00:45:42.408 --> 00:45:44.493
This smell... The ticket!

00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:49.540
<i>I knew it. It's giving off
a faint demon smell, too.</i>

00:45:50.082 --> 00:45:52.626
<i>We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.</i>

00:45:53.377 --> 00:45:55.546
<i>This must be a demon's work!</i>

00:45:56.046 --> 00:46:01.093
<i>Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?</i>

00:46:03.637 --> 00:46:05.055
<i>I don't know why...</i>

00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:09.977
<i>but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.</i>

00:46:12.104 --> 00:46:13.773
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

00:46:14.356 --> 00:46:16.150
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:26.118
Zenitsu! Wake up!

00:46:26.368 --> 00:46:29.371
Wake up, Zenitsu!
You have to wake up!

00:46:31.874 --> 00:46:34.251
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

00:46:35.377 --> 00:46:36.504
Inosuke...

00:46:39.381 --> 00:46:41.759
There, there... Sorry, okay?

00:46:42.343 --> 00:46:43.385
Thanks.

00:46:43.677 --> 00:46:45.262
You did a great job, Nezuko.

00:46:48.682 --> 00:46:51.268
<i>It's no good. These two don't wake up.</i>

00:46:52.144 --> 00:46:53.521
<i>What can I do?</i>

00:46:56.524 --> 00:46:57.316
Rengoku—

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:01.946
What are you doing?

00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:07.952
<i>Is a demon controlling her?</i>

00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:09.745
Get out of our way!

00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:13.833
Thanks to you guys,
we won't be able to have dreams!

00:47:16.377 --> 00:47:18.003
<i>Is she acting of her own free will?</i>

00:47:20.047 --> 00:47:21.382
<i>This man, too?</i>

00:47:24.885 --> 00:47:26.429
What do you think you're doing?

00:47:26.804 --> 00:47:29.306
If you're awake,
you'd better help us out!

00:47:29.598 --> 00:47:33.310
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

00:47:33.352 --> 00:47:37.565
I'm going to tell him, and then,
he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

00:47:40.484 --> 00:47:43.195
<i>Is he the one
who was connected to me?</i>

00:47:43.737 --> 00:47:45.030
<i>Tuberculosis...</i>

00:47:45.406 --> 00:47:46.699
<i>He's sick.</i>

00:47:47.241 --> 00:47:48.701
<i>Poor man.</i>

00:47:49.743 --> 00:47:51.704
<i>What this demon did is unforgivable.</i>

00:47:52.204 --> 00:47:54.790
<i>He took advantage of their weak souls!</i>

00:47:56.959 --> 00:47:57.877
Sorry.

00:47:58.711 --> 00:48:01.380
I have to go fight.

00:48:17.104 --> 00:48:19.899
You want to stay
inside a happy dream, don't you?

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.318
I know.

00:48:23.402 --> 00:48:26.572
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

00:48:31.911 --> 00:48:34.622
If only this was the dream...

00:48:45.299 --> 00:48:46.926
<i>I was willing...</i>

00:48:46.967 --> 00:48:54.183
<i>to hurt others if it meant
I could escape from the pain of this illness.</i>

00:48:55.768 --> 00:48:58.187
<i>But it was warm...</i>

00:48:58.771 --> 00:49:01.941
<i>inside your dream and inside your soul.</i>

00:49:03.484 --> 00:49:06.946
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

00:49:10.491 --> 00:49:13.702
The air is so clear, and it feels good.

00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:24.713
Is that his spiritual core?

00:49:25.256 --> 00:49:26.715
Why are you showing it to me?

00:49:30.845 --> 00:49:34.849
Did you bring me here
because I was searching for it?

00:49:40.563 --> 00:49:42.189
No way!

00:49:42.815 --> 00:49:45.526
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

00:49:46.318 --> 00:49:47.820
Why would you...

00:49:49.738 --> 00:49:55.870
<i>The shining little sprites
inside you lit up my heart.</i>

00:49:58.372 --> 00:49:59.957
Are you all right?

00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:03.711
Thank you.

00:50:05.713 --> 00:50:07.089
Be careful.

00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:12.178
Right!

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:13.596
Nezuko!

00:50:25.399 --> 00:50:27.401
<i>The smell is overpowering!</i>

00:50:27.735 --> 00:50:28.652
<i>So heavy!</i>

00:50:29.153 --> 00:50:32.656
<i>The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!</i>

00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:35.659
<i>Was I asleep in such an awful scent?</i>

00:50:36.827 --> 00:50:39.288
<i>Even if each car was closed off and airtight,</i>

00:50:39.622 --> 00:50:41.165
<i>I can't believe I was!</i>

00:50:41.791 --> 00:50:43.000
<i>I was useless!</i>

00:50:44.043 --> 00:50:45.377
<i>The demon's upwind...</i>

00:50:45.878 --> 00:50:47.171
<i>Is he in the first car?</i>

00:50:51.133 --> 00:50:52.301
Nezuko, don't come!

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.303
Stay away from me and wait!

00:50:54.845 --> 00:50:56.472
Go wake everyone up!

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.565
What? You're awake?

00:51:06.982 --> 00:51:08.400
Good morning!

00:51:08.734 --> 00:51:12.488
You could've stayed asleep.

00:51:13.531 --> 00:51:14.990
<i>It was him!</i>

00:51:16.242 --> 00:51:17.910
Why did you wake up?

00:51:18.953 --> 00:51:22.915
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:28.921
I could've shown you a dream
where your family was being slaughtered.

00:51:29.213 --> 00:51:31.674
Would you have liked that one better?

00:51:31.715 --> 00:51:34.343
No, of course not.
Too distressing, right?

00:51:37.555 --> 00:51:39.140
All right, next...

00:51:39.723 --> 00:51:43.394
Why don't I show you a dream
where your father comes back to life?

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.655
<i>What I really love...</i>

00:51:55.197 --> 00:52:01.662
<i>is to show people nightmares
right after a happy dream.</i>

00:52:02.204 --> 00:52:06.417
<i>I just adore the sight
of a distorted human face.</i>

00:52:07.251 --> 00:52:09.170
<i>I get such a kick out of that!</i>

00:52:09.712 --> 00:52:18.429
<i>How enthralling is it to gaze at someone
shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?</i>

00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:21.932
<i>But I don't usually let my guard down.</i>

00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:26.937
<i>So, it may take longer,
but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers.</i>

00:52:27.563 --> 00:52:30.149
<i>I mixed my blood
with the ink on the tickets.</i>

00:52:30.483 --> 00:52:36.697
<i>Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...</i>

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.992
<i>the spell activates.</i>

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.789
<i>And yet...</i>

00:52:45.664 --> 00:52:48.834
<i>how did this one manage to wake up?</i>

00:52:49.335 --> 00:52:52.713
<i>And he found the way to wake up in a short time.</i>

00:52:53.380 --> 00:53:00.137
<i>Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...</i>

00:53:01.555 --> 00:53:04.767
is so enormous!

00:53:06.894 --> 00:53:09.980
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

00:53:10.648 --> 00:53:12.650
I won't let you...

00:53:13.067 --> 00:53:14.443
get away with this!

00:53:16.987 --> 00:53:20.449
<i>What's that? I see he's wearing earrings.</i>

00:53:23.828 --> 00:53:25.663
How lucky is that?

00:53:25.996 --> 00:53:29.208
So, he came right to me!

00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:31.877
This is like a dream!

00:53:31.919 --> 00:53:36.465
Now I can receive
even more blood of Master Muzan!

00:53:37.091 --> 00:53:40.553
And once I become more powerful,

00:53:40.594 --> 00:53:45.474
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

00:53:48.102 --> 00:53:49.770
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:53:51.105 --> 00:53:52.440
<i>Tenth Form...</i>

00:53:52.982 --> 00:53:54.942
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:01.157
<i>Blood Demon Art!</i>

00:54:04.034 --> 00:54:07.913
<i>Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.</i>

00:54:08.414 --> 00:54:11.917
Go to sleep!

00:54:20.718 --> 00:54:21.969
<i>He's not falling asleep.</i>

00:54:27.683 --> 00:54:28.601
Go to sleep.

00:54:36.192 --> 00:54:37.109
Go to sleep.

00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:41.197
Go to sleep!

00:54:41.447 --> 00:54:42.490
Go to sleep!

00:54:46.243 --> 00:54:51.957
Go... to... sleep!

00:54:53.501 --> 00:54:55.252
<i>It's not working. But why not?</i>

00:54:56.087 --> 00:54:57.880
<i>No, that's not what this is.</i>

00:54:58.631 --> 00:55:02.301
<i>He's falling under this spell over and over!</i>

00:55:09.016 --> 00:55:12.228
<i>He's aware that he's under the spell right away.</i>

00:55:15.481 --> 00:55:18.484
<i>And he's committing suicide
in order to awaken!</i>

00:55:24.198 --> 00:55:27.952
<i>Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...</i>

00:55:27.993 --> 00:55:30.871
<i>to take his own life with his own hands...</i>

00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:33.624
<i>that takes incredible willpower!</i>

00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:35.543
<i>This brat...</i>

00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:39.463
<i>is insane!</i>

00:55:48.431 --> 00:55:52.935
Why didn't you save us?

00:55:56.939 --> 00:56:00.818
What were you doing
while we were being murdered?

00:56:03.362 --> 00:56:07.575
How could you be the only one to survive?

00:56:15.249 --> 00:56:18.169
Why do you think you were here?

00:56:18.502 --> 00:56:20.588
You're so useless!

00:56:28.512 --> 00:56:31.307
It should've been you that died.

00:56:32.141 --> 00:56:35.686
How dare you go on living
without a care.

00:56:43.027 --> 00:56:47.448
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

00:56:48.032 --> 00:56:49.825
Don't you dare...

00:56:50.451 --> 00:56:51.744
insult...

00:56:51.786 --> 00:56:54.914
my family!

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:21.607
<i>It was way too easy.</i>

00:57:23.025 --> 00:57:25.194
<i>Could this be a dream, too?</i>

00:57:25.611 --> 00:57:29.573
<i>Or was this demon weaker than him?</i>

00:57:30.658 --> 00:57:32.576
I can totally see why...

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:38.165
he ordered me to kill you,
the boy with the earrings,

00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:42.336
along with the Hashira!

00:57:43.003 --> 00:57:45.840
Your very existence is, like...

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:50.177
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

00:57:50.719 --> 00:57:51.929
<i>He's not dying?</i>

00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:55.099
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:58.519
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

00:58:00.187 --> 00:58:05.276
You want to know why I'm not dead
after you decapitated me, don't you?

00:58:05.776 --> 00:58:09.864
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

00:58:10.448 --> 00:58:14.326
It's so easy
even an infant would understand.

00:58:16.495 --> 00:58:20.374
It's because the body over there
was no longer my main body.

00:58:20.958 --> 00:58:23.878
Same with this thing
that's talking to you now.

00:58:24.211 --> 00:58:27.882
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:31.385
While you were snoozing away...

00:58:32.052 --> 00:58:35.264
I fused with this train!

00:58:36.682 --> 00:58:43.397
Every inch of this train has become
my blood, my flesh and my bones!

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.941
Look at your face.

00:58:46.275 --> 00:58:49.153
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

00:58:49.945 --> 00:58:53.240
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

00:58:53.282 --> 00:58:57.203
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

00:58:57.661 --> 00:58:59.663
as well as my hostages.

00:59:00.247 --> 00:59:04.168
So, do you think
you can protect them by yourself?

00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:10.424
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:14.261
Can you alone keep me
from devouring them?

00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:23.729
<i>What should I do? What should I do?</i>

00:59:24.271 --> 00:59:27.399
<i>The most I can protect on my own is two cars!</i>

00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:30.152
<i>Any more than that,
and I can't guarantee their safety!</i>

00:59:30.903 --> 00:59:34.365
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

00:59:34.949 --> 00:59:38.994
This is no time to be sleeping!
Wake up, will you? Please!

00:59:39.537 --> 00:59:40.913
Nezuko!

00:59:41.247 --> 00:59:43.749
Protect the sleeping passengers!

00:59:55.428 --> 00:59:57.388
Follow me, damn minions!

00:59:57.721 --> 00:59:58.722
All right!

00:59:59.265 --> 01:00:00.933
<i>Explosive Awakening!</i>

01:00:02.059 --> 01:00:04.145
Comin' through!

01:00:04.854 --> 01:00:07.857
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

01:00:07.898 --> 01:00:09.150
Inosuke!

01:00:09.483 --> 01:00:11.652
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

01:00:11.902 --> 01:00:13.904
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

01:00:14.196 --> 01:00:16.615
This whole train's turned into a demon!

01:00:16.657 --> 01:00:19.910
Can you hear me?
This whole train is a demon!

01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:25.416
I knew it!
So, I was right on the money!

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:29.462
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

01:00:33.841 --> 01:00:36.719
<i>Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...</i>

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:39.221
<i>Crazy Cutting!</i>

01:00:44.018 --> 01:00:47.188
I'll save every last one of you guys!

01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:49.315
Fall onto your knees...

01:00:49.648 --> 01:00:51.484
and worship me!

01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:53.486
Glorify me!

01:00:53.819 --> 01:00:58.824
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

01:00:59.366 --> 01:01:01.577
I have to go save the passengers!

01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:05.664
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

01:01:30.773 --> 01:01:33.192
It's gone this far already?

01:01:36.195 --> 01:01:37.446
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

01:01:37.988 --> 01:01:39.323
<i>First Form...</i>

01:01:39.573 --> 01:01:41.075
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:45.162
<i>No good.</i>

01:01:45.454 --> 01:01:47.498
<i>This is never going to end!</i>

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:49.834
<i>How am I supposed to fend it off?</i>

01:01:56.382 --> 01:02:01.846
<i>Damn Demon Slayer,
scurrying around inside me.</i>

01:02:02.263 --> 01:02:05.641
<i>You can cut all you want,
but I'll just keep regenerating.</i>

01:02:05.683 --> 01:02:09.770
<i>And then, after all your strength is depleted...</i>

01:02:10.312 --> 01:02:16.444
<i>I'm going to partake of those
200 passengers in a leisurely feast.</i>

01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:29.141
<i>Thunder Breathing...</i>

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:31.268
<i>First Form...</i>

01:03:31.977 --> 01:03:33.354
<i>Thunderclap and Flash!</i>

01:03:37.483 --> 01:03:38.609
<i>Sixfold.</i>

01:03:39.193 --> 01:03:40.361
I'll protect you...

01:03:41.195 --> 01:03:42.613
Nezuko!

01:03:45.491 --> 01:03:46.867
Protect...

01:03:53.707 --> 01:03:55.292
<i>That sounded like thunder.</i>

01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:57.086
<i>From one of the cars in the back?</i>

01:03:57.128 --> 01:03:59.046
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:03:59.088 --> 01:04:00.965
<i>Is Zenitsu awake now?</i>

01:04:01.465 --> 01:04:02.883
<i>What about Rengoku?</i>

01:04:02.925 --> 01:04:04.218
<i>And Nezuko?</i>

01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:12.893
<i>I cannot do anything
but protect the people here!</i>

01:04:13.602 --> 01:04:15.187
<i>This is bad! What should I do?</i>

01:04:15.229 --> 01:04:16.856
<i>We can't fight in coordination!</i>

01:04:17.189 --> 01:04:20.109
<i>Are the passengers in the back all right?</i>

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:21.527
<i>Damn!</i>

01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:23.404
<i>It's so cramped!</i>

01:04:24.196 --> 01:04:26.198
<i>And so hard to swing my sword!</i>

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:36.709
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

01:04:37.334 --> 01:04:39.295
How could this be?

01:04:39.837 --> 01:04:42.214
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:45.050
If only I could crawl...

01:04:47.303 --> 01:04:48.721
under a rock!

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:56.896
What happened?

01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:04.403
<i>What was that?</i>

01:05:04.445 --> 01:05:06.071
<i>A demon attack?</i>

01:05:08.365 --> 01:05:09.867
Young Kamado!

01:05:11.535 --> 01:05:12.870
Rengoku!

01:05:13.204 --> 01:05:16.540
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

01:05:16.582 --> 01:05:19.210
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

01:05:19.543 --> 01:05:21.754
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

01:05:21.796 --> 01:05:22.713
Okay!

01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:24.965
This train has eight cars in all.

01:05:25.299 --> 01:05:27.218
I'll protect the five in the rear.

01:05:27.593 --> 01:05:31.472
The yellow boy and your sister
will be in charge of the rest.

01:05:31.806 --> 01:05:33.307
You and the boar head boy...

01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:37.269
will go look for the demon's head
while keeping an eye on those three cars.

01:05:37.603 --> 01:05:38.562
Head?

01:05:38.979 --> 01:05:39.980
But this demon is—

01:05:40.022 --> 01:05:43.818
No matter what form he's assumed,
so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

01:05:44.235 --> 01:05:46.237
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

01:05:46.487 --> 01:05:48.364
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

01:05:52.034 --> 01:05:54.370
<i>Amazing! I can't even see him!</i>

01:05:54.411 --> 01:05:57.790
<i>Did the train shake earlier
because Rengoku was on the move?</i>

01:05:58.457 --> 01:06:01.293
<i>He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!</i>

01:06:01.585 --> 01:06:03.546
<i>Five cars, all by himself?</i>

01:06:04.797 --> 01:06:08.634
<i>This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!</i>

01:06:08.884 --> 01:06:12.513
<i>The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!</i>

01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.767
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

01:06:17.143 --> 01:06:18.853
Shut up, or I'll kill you!

01:06:18.894 --> 01:06:19.854
Up there, huh?

01:06:20.146 --> 01:06:22.898
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.026
But somehow...

01:06:26.402 --> 01:06:28.028
Somehow...

01:06:28.904 --> 01:06:30.781
Somehow, he was awesome!

01:06:31.115 --> 01:06:33.617
I'm so pissed!

01:06:33.909 --> 01:06:37.246
Inosuke! Keep an eye
on the three cars in the front!

01:06:37.496 --> 01:06:39.081
You don't have to tell me!

01:06:39.331 --> 01:06:42.460
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

01:06:42.501 --> 01:06:44.503
With my all-out Seventh Form...

01:06:44.754 --> 01:06:46.630
I found this master's weak spot!

01:06:46.964 --> 01:06:50.009
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:51.510
That's right, up front!

01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:54.388
And that front part
is a heck of a lot creepier!

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:58.350
<i>The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,</i>

01:06:58.392 --> 01:07:00.728
<i>but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!</i>

01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:03.230
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

01:07:03.272 --> 01:07:04.273
That's right!

01:07:04.315 --> 01:07:05.232
Understood!

01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:07.359
Okay, let's go!

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:08.861
Forward!

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:22.374
This is it, huh?

01:07:26.754 --> 01:07:27.713
All right!

01:07:35.096 --> 01:07:36.180
Inosuke!

01:07:36.806 --> 01:07:39.433
Fishy, very fishy!

01:07:39.767 --> 01:07:41.769
Especially around here!

01:07:41.811 --> 01:07:43.187
Who the hell are you?

01:07:43.437 --> 01:07:45.189
G-Get out of here!

01:07:45.689 --> 01:07:47.191
The demon's head...

01:07:47.525 --> 01:07:48.692
The demon's...

01:07:49.068 --> 01:07:50.444
weak spot!

01:07:55.699 --> 01:07:56.575
Gross!

01:07:56.992 --> 01:07:58.911
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

01:08:01.205 --> 01:08:02.832
That's way too many hands!

01:08:03.415 --> 01:08:04.375
Uh-oh!

01:08:07.336 --> 01:08:10.131
<i>Water Breathing, Sixth Form...</i>

01:08:10.464 --> 01:08:11.632
<i>Whirlpool!</i>

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.225
Inosuke, are you all right?

01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:23.727
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:24.770
Yeah, I know!

01:08:27.606 --> 01:08:28.732
<i>It's here...</i>

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:31.193
<i>It's right beneath!</i>

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:33.319
<i>Directly below this place.</i>

01:08:33.362 --> 01:08:35.113
<i>The demon's scent is powerful!</i>

01:08:35.363 --> 01:08:38.200
Inosuke! The demon's head
is right below here!

01:08:38.242 --> 01:08:41.078
Don't boss me around!
I'm the leader!

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:41.996
Fine!

01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:43.747
Just watch.

01:08:44.081 --> 01:08:46.876
<i>Beast Breathing, Second Fang...</i>

01:08:48.252 --> 01:08:50.004
<i>Slice!</i>

01:08:56.551 --> 01:08:57.511
It's the bone.

01:08:57.928 --> 01:08:59.388
<i>His neck bone!</i>

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.850
<i>Water Breathing, Eighth Form...</i>

01:09:03.142 --> 01:09:04.185
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:10.024
<i>It blocked it!</i>

01:09:26.122 --> 01:09:27.750
<i>The gash is closing up!</i>

01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:30.044
<i>It's regenerating so fast!</i>

01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:34.715
<i>Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!</i>

01:09:35.049 --> 01:09:36.801
<i>I have to sever it!</i>

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:40.638
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

01:09:41.013 --> 01:09:45.350
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

01:09:45.392 --> 01:09:48.104
Sounds good! Great idea!

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:49.604
I can praise you for that!

01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:50.773
Thanks!

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:53.692
Let's go!

01:10:01.617 --> 01:10:05.830
<i>Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.</i>

01:10:06.122 --> 01:10:07.331
<i>A Blood Demon Art!</i>

01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:11.001
<i>He got me!
He's putting me to sleep!</i>

01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:15.339
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:16.757
Then, you'll wake up!

01:10:21.554 --> 01:10:22.596
<i>It's all right!</i>

01:10:22.930 --> 01:10:24.974
<i>Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!</i>

01:10:25.891 --> 01:10:30.980
<i>Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes!
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!</i>

01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:33.899
<i>Okay, I'm awake!</i>

01:10:40.197 --> 01:10:44.702
<i>Damn! Even though I'm awake,
I can't avoid looking at the eyes!</i>

01:10:44.994 --> 01:10:47.496
<i>I have to wake up with my eyes shut!</i>

01:10:47.538 --> 01:10:49.331
<i>With my eyes shut!</i>

01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:52.126
<i>No good!</i>

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.461
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:10:53.836 --> 01:10:55.212
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:10:55.463 --> 01:10:56.213
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:57.715
<i>Cut the neck!</i>

01:10:58.090 --> 01:10:59.717
<i>Cut it! Cut it!</i>

01:11:00.426 --> 01:11:01.802
<i>I have to wake up!</i>

01:11:03.763 --> 01:11:04.972
<i>Hurry!</i>

01:11:05.639 --> 01:11:07.808
<i>Wake up!</i>

01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:13.647
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

01:11:14.023 --> 01:11:15.858
Don't fall for his trap!

01:11:16.192 --> 01:11:18.402
Don't die such lame deaths!

01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.910
I'm wearing the hide
of the mountain god on my head.

01:11:26.243 --> 01:11:29.079
I bet he's too scared
to look me in the eye!

01:11:30.372 --> 01:11:32.208
You loser eyeballs!

01:11:32.541 --> 01:11:37.254
<i>I see. He's having a hard time
telling which way Inosuke's looking!</i>

01:11:37.546 --> 01:11:41.342
All right, now all we gotta do
is slash this thing to death!

01:11:45.805 --> 01:11:46.764
Inosuke!

01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:50.142
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

01:11:57.191 --> 01:11:58.651
Did you get stabbed?

01:11:58.692 --> 01:12:00.069
I'm okay.

01:12:02.321 --> 01:12:04.532
Just forget about that bastard!

01:12:04.865 --> 01:12:07.034
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:11.872
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

01:12:12.206 --> 01:12:14.333
I know! Let's get moving!

01:12:31.642 --> 01:12:32.518
Inosuke!

01:12:33.144 --> 01:12:34.645
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

01:12:34.687 --> 01:12:36.564
And let's chop off the demon's head!

01:12:36.897 --> 01:12:38.441
Let's attack together!

01:13:14.018 --> 01:13:16.395
<i>No good! If I fall asleep now...</i>

01:13:16.687 --> 01:13:17.897
Damn you!

01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.399
C'mon! Follow me!

01:13:20.733 --> 01:13:23.402
<i>Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...</i>

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:28.115
<i>Slice 'n' Dice!</i>

01:13:31.994 --> 01:13:34.455
<i>Father, please protect me!</i>

01:13:34.997 --> 01:13:38.042
<i>I'm going to sever that bone...</i>

01:13:38.959 --> 01:13:40.086
<i>with this blow!</i>

01:13:40.336 --> 01:13:42.213
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:45.883
<i>Clear Blue Sky!</i>

01:14:06.987 --> 01:14:09.448
Because of its screams and tremors,

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.699
the train's turning over!

01:14:10.908 --> 01:14:12.326
Are you okay, Inosuke?

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:15.204
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

01:14:15.246 --> 01:14:16.539
Y-Yeah!

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.208
Inosuke, protect the passen—

01:14:21.127 --> 01:14:22.294
<i>I can't die.</i>

01:14:23.087 --> 01:14:26.841
<i>If I die, that'll make him a murderer!</i>

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:28.259
<i>I can't die!</i>

01:14:31.137 --> 01:14:33.055
<i>I don't want to let anyone die!</i>

01:14:59.957 --> 01:15:02.251
Are you okay, Santaro?

01:15:04.378 --> 01:15:06.213
Hang in there!

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:09.216
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:11.135
Cool, huh?

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:13.053
Is your belly okay?

01:15:13.304 --> 01:15:15.097
Your belly that got stabbed!

01:15:15.431 --> 01:15:16.432
I'm...

01:15:16.766 --> 01:15:18.392
all right.

01:15:18.809 --> 01:15:20.144
What about you?

01:15:20.394 --> 01:15:23.564
Never felt better!
I didn't even catch a cold!

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:27.151
I won't be able to move for a while.

01:15:28.402 --> 01:15:31.071
Help the others, will you?

01:15:32.406 --> 01:15:34.492
Was anyone injured?

01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:39.121
What about the engineer near the head?

01:15:41.457 --> 01:15:43.626
It's okay if that bastard dies!

01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:46.045
It's not okay.

01:15:46.087 --> 01:15:48.672
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

01:15:48.714 --> 01:15:52.134
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

01:15:52.426 --> 01:15:54.804
His leg's shattered,
and he can't walk anymore!

01:15:54.845 --> 01:15:56.305
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

01:15:56.722 --> 01:16:00.434
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

01:16:00.935 --> 01:16:02.895
Help him, will you?

01:16:04.939 --> 01:16:06.148
Please.

01:16:13.614 --> 01:16:15.032
I'll go for you, then!

01:16:15.074 --> 01:16:16.742
Because I'm the boss!

01:16:17.076 --> 01:16:18.994
Because my minion asked me to!

01:16:19.286 --> 01:16:23.415
After I rescue him,
I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:27.336
That's really not necessary.

01:16:31.799 --> 01:16:33.926
<i>It's almost dawn.</i>

01:16:35.469 --> 01:16:37.346
<i>Get your breathing under control.</i>

01:16:38.472 --> 01:16:39.598
<i>We have to...</i>

01:16:40.224 --> 01:16:41.600
<i>save the injured...</i>

01:16:42.226 --> 01:16:43.727
<i>before it's too late.</i>

01:16:45.521 --> 01:16:46.814
<i>Nezuko...</i>

01:16:47.148 --> 01:16:48.441
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

01:16:48.941 --> 01:16:50.234
<i>Rengoku...</i>

01:16:51.735 --> 01:16:53.779
<i>I'm sure they're all safe!</i>

01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:55.781
<i>You have to believe!</i>

01:17:02.496 --> 01:17:04.457
<i>My body's disintegrating.</i>

01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:06.584
<i>I can't regenerate.</i>

01:17:07.543 --> 01:17:10.671
<i>Did I lose? Am I going to die?</i>

01:17:11.005 --> 01:17:12.214
<i>Me?</i>

01:17:12.506 --> 01:17:13.466
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

01:17:13.799 --> 01:17:17.470
<i>Ridiculous!
I haven't been able to go all out!</i>

01:17:17.928 --> 01:17:20.931
<i>I couldn't devour a single human!</i>

01:17:20.973 --> 01:17:26.479
<i>My plan to fuse with the train and devour
humans en masse just went up in smoke!</i>

01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:29.482
<i>And now, look what I've been reduced to!</i>

01:17:29.732 --> 01:17:33.027
<i>After all the time and trouble I've taken!</i>

01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:34.987
<i>It was him!</i>

01:17:35.237 --> 01:17:37.114
<i>It's all his fault!</i>

01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:42.912
<i>Even though I'd taken
200 humans hostage, still I struggled!</i>

01:17:42.953 --> 01:17:44.413
<i>I was held at bay!</i>

01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:47.249
<i>Is this the power of a Hashira?</i>

01:17:47.666 --> 01:17:50.586
<i>And him... He was fast, too.</i>

01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:54.006
<i>Even though he never broke
the spell completely!</i>

01:17:54.048 --> 01:17:58.552
<i>Not to mention that girl!
She's a demon! What's that about?</i>

01:17:58.594 --> 01:18:00.930
<i>A demon, joining forces
with Demon Slayers?</i>

01:18:00.971 --> 01:18:04.266
<i>Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?</i>

01:18:05.643 --> 01:18:08.270
<i>Dammit! Dammit!</i>

01:18:08.687 --> 01:18:10.064
<i>In the first place...</i>

01:18:10.356 --> 01:18:14.819
<i>it all started going downhill
once that brat broke my spell!</i>

01:18:15.152 --> 01:18:17.530
<i>That brat is to blame!</i>

01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:21.408
<i>I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!</i>

01:18:21.909 --> 01:18:24.328
<i>That's right, and that boar, too!</i>

01:18:24.662 --> 01:18:28.124
<i>I could've at least killed that brat!</i>

01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:32.336
<i>But that boar thwarted me.
His intuition is extraordinary.</i>

01:18:32.378 --> 01:18:34.588
<i>He could sense my gaze!</i>

01:18:36.132 --> 01:18:37.675
<i>Am I going to lose?</i>

01:18:38.008 --> 01:18:39.969
<i>Am I going to die?</i>

01:18:40.594 --> 01:18:45.349
<i>Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!</i>

01:18:46.725 --> 01:18:51.355
<i>It's always the bottom-feeder demons
who get killed by the Demon Slayers.</i>

01:18:51.772 --> 01:18:52.982
<i>In the Upper Ranks...</i>

01:18:53.023 --> 01:18:56.694
<i>the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.</i>

01:18:56.735 --> 01:19:01.699
<i>They're strong enough to defeat Hashira
who've killed an untold number of demons.</i>

01:19:02.032 --> 01:19:04.702
<i>Do they have otherworldly powers?</i>

01:19:05.453 --> 01:19:10.583
<i>Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!</i>

01:19:12.585 --> 01:19:15.713
<i>I want to do it over!
I want to do it over!</i>

01:19:15.755 --> 01:19:21.427
<i>What a miserable nightmare this is...</i>

01:19:28.726 --> 01:19:31.270
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

01:19:31.604 --> 01:19:33.230
Impressive!

01:19:34.356 --> 01:19:35.900
Rengoku...

01:19:36.484 --> 01:19:39.361
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

01:19:39.612 --> 01:19:42.740
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

01:19:43.991 --> 01:19:45.409
I'll do my best.

01:19:46.452 --> 01:19:48.287
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

01:19:48.871 --> 01:19:52.082
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

01:19:52.416 --> 01:19:55.586
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

01:19:56.295 --> 01:19:57.588
There's a blood vessel.

01:19:58.005 --> 01:19:59.632
A torn blood vessel.

01:20:03.594 --> 01:20:04.970
Concentrate harder!

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.027
That's it. Stanch it.
Stop the bleeding.

01:20:25.366 --> 01:20:26.700
Focus!

01:20:36.293 --> 01:20:38.712
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

01:20:38.963 --> 01:20:42.633
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.302
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:49.723
but you'll become a stronger version
of yourself than yesterday for sure.

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:52.476
Right.

01:20:54.353 --> 01:20:55.604
Everyone's safe!

01:20:55.938 --> 01:20:58.816
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:03.654
Don't strain yourself.
Take it easy and rest up.

01:21:08.075 --> 01:21:09.577
Thank you very much.

01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:41.859
<i>Upper... Three?</i>

01:21:42.568 --> 01:21:44.570
<i>What's he doing here and now?</i>

01:21:57.541 --> 01:21:59.502
<i>Flame Breathing, Second Form...</i>

01:22:01.879 --> 01:22:03.422
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

01:22:13.599 --> 01:22:15.267
That's a fine sword.

01:22:17.478 --> 01:22:19.063
<i>He sure can regenerate fast.</i>

01:22:19.438 --> 01:22:21.774
<i>This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...</i>

01:22:22.191 --> 01:22:23.526
<i>So, this is an Upper Rank.</i>

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:28.072
I can't understand why you'd go
after a wounded person first.

01:22:29.156 --> 01:22:33.410
He could get in the way
of the chitchat... of you and me.

01:22:33.702 --> 01:22:35.996
What would you and I have to talk about?

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:40.418
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:44.797
Is that right?
Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:47.758
The sight of a weakling
makes my skin crawl.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:52.346
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

01:22:53.806 --> 01:22:56.600
All right, then I have
a brilliant proposal for you.

01:22:56.934 --> 01:22:59.437
Why don't you become a demon, too?

01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:00.938
I will not.

01:23:01.605 --> 01:23:04.733
I can tell your strength at a glance.

01:23:04.775 --> 01:23:06.402
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

01:23:06.694 --> 01:23:09.196
Your fighting spirit
has been honed to the hilt.

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:11.866
It's close to the realm of the highest.

01:23:12.241 --> 01:23:16.036
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

01:23:16.579 --> 01:23:18.497
I'm Akaza.

01:23:18.831 --> 01:23:19.832
Kyojuro...

01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:25.004
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

01:23:25.337 --> 01:23:26.839
Because you're a human.

01:23:27.381 --> 01:23:30.134
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

01:23:31.844 --> 01:23:34.263
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:39.643
Do that, and you can go on training
for a hundred, for two hundred years.

01:23:39.685 --> 01:23:41.270
You can become stronger.

01:23:42.855 --> 01:23:47.777
<i>Of all the demons that I've met until now,
he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!</i>

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:50.029
<i>I have to help him fight!</i>

01:23:51.071 --> 01:23:57.495
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

01:23:57.787 --> 01:24:00.998
The fact that we grow old and die

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.543
is what makes human life
so unbearably precious and noble.

01:24:05.836 --> 01:24:10.633
"Strength" isn't a word
used to describe just the body.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.806
This boy isn't weak!

01:24:18.265 --> 01:24:19.934
Don't insult him.

01:24:20.226 --> 01:24:21.936
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

01:24:21.977 --> 01:24:25.231
You and I have different senses of value.

01:24:25.898 --> 01:24:29.819
No matter what the reason,
I will not become a demon!

01:24:34.657 --> 01:24:36.325
I see.

01:24:38.285 --> 01:24:40.121
<i>Technique Development...</i>

01:24:41.914 --> 01:24:44.166
<i>Destructive Death... Compass Needle!</i>

01:24:59.098 --> 01:25:01.684
If you refuse to become a demon,
I'll kill you.

01:25:15.739 --> 01:25:18.367
<i>I can't follow their movements!</i>

01:25:18.409 --> 01:25:22.329
There were never any Flames
among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

01:25:23.038 --> 01:25:26.083
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

01:25:30.546 --> 01:25:32.381
Why do you think that is?

01:25:32.423 --> 01:25:36.719
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

01:25:37.303 --> 01:25:40.639
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:49.982
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

01:25:50.024 --> 01:25:52.359
It pains me! I can't bear it!

01:25:53.152 --> 01:25:55.112
Die, Kyojuro...

01:25:55.362 --> 01:25:57.198
while you're still young and strong.

01:25:59.867 --> 01:26:01.118
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:03.704
<i>Air Type!</i>

01:26:17.009 --> 01:26:17.968
<i>I see.</i>

01:26:20.304 --> 01:26:22.014
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

01:26:22.223 --> 01:26:23.474
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

01:26:23.516 --> 01:26:25.601
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

01:26:27.812 --> 01:26:30.940
<i>When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!</i>

01:26:34.193 --> 01:26:36.487
<i>He can move
faster than the blink of an eye.</i>

01:26:42.493 --> 01:26:47.331
<i>If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.</i>

01:26:47.373 --> 01:26:48.624
<i>In that case...</i>

01:26:54.046 --> 01:26:55.339
<i>I'll just have to get up close!</i>

01:26:56.424 --> 01:26:58.968
This superb reaction speed of yours...

01:27:01.804 --> 01:27:04.932
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

01:27:05.224 --> 01:27:06.475
Kyojuro!

01:27:06.517 --> 01:27:08.018
Doesn't that make you sad?

01:27:08.269 --> 01:27:09.437
It happens to everyone!

01:27:09.728 --> 01:27:11.897
It's a fact of life for any human!

01:27:13.482 --> 01:27:14.900
Stay where you are!

01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:17.194
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

01:27:17.611 --> 01:27:18.779
Stand back! That's an order!

01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:22.158
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

01:27:22.575 --> 01:27:24.034
Come on, give me your best shot!

01:27:27.371 --> 01:27:29.039
Concentrate on me.

01:27:41.343 --> 01:27:42.803
Nice moves!

01:27:48.976 --> 01:27:50.227
Rengoku!

01:27:50.269 --> 01:27:51.645
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

01:27:55.191 --> 01:27:57.902
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

01:28:01.697 --> 01:28:06.035
Fight me forever
and get stronger together with me.

01:28:09.914 --> 01:28:12.374
You have what it takes to do that!

01:28:14.293 --> 01:28:15.628
I'll pass!

01:28:15.961 --> 01:28:19.340
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

01:28:22.927 --> 01:28:25.096
I will not become a demon!

01:28:25.554 --> 01:28:26.555
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

01:28:28.474 --> 01:28:29.725
<i>Third Form...</i>

01:28:30.434 --> 01:28:32.019
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

01:28:35.022 --> 01:28:36.941
Magnificent! That's sensational!

01:28:38.776 --> 01:28:39.944
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

01:28:39.985 --> 01:28:41.070
<i>Air Type!</i>

01:28:49.578 --> 01:28:51.038
<i>There's no opening.</i>

01:28:51.372 --> 01:28:52.540
<i>I can't jump in.</i>

01:28:52.873 --> 01:28:55.376
<i>I can't keep up
with the speed of their movements!</i>

01:28:55.418 --> 01:28:58.170
<i>Those two are in a different dimension!</i>

01:28:58.421 --> 01:29:02.550
<i>Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!</i>

01:29:02.883 --> 01:29:04.552
<i>I can't move...</i>

01:29:04.802 --> 01:29:08.472
<i>because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!</i>

01:29:11.308 --> 01:29:12.935
Rengoku...

01:29:17.273 --> 01:29:18.983
You still don't get it?

01:29:19.316 --> 01:29:24.655
That if you continue attacking,
you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

01:29:34.123 --> 01:29:35.708
<i>Flame Breathing, First Form...</i>

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:37.001
<i>Unknowing Fire!</i>

01:29:39.462 --> 01:29:41.630
It would be a shame to kill you now!

01:29:42.006 --> 01:29:44.341
You haven't reached
your physical peak yet!

01:29:50.306 --> 01:29:51.307
<i>Second Form...</i>

01:29:52.641 --> 01:29:54.351
<i>Rising Scorching Sun!</i>

01:29:55.811 --> 01:30:00.566
In a year or two, you'll have polished your skills
even more, and you'll have greater precision!

01:30:12.828 --> 01:30:14.038
<i>Third Form...</i>

01:30:14.288 --> 01:30:15.748
<i>Blazing Universe!</i>

01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:18.250
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

01:30:18.501 --> 01:30:20.586
<i>Blooming Flame Undulation!</i>

01:30:22.797 --> 01:30:24.715
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

01:30:25.966 --> 01:30:27.301
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:29.011
<i>Flame Tiger!</i>

01:30:32.515 --> 01:30:34.100
<i>Disorder!</i>

01:30:37.978 --> 01:30:39.730
Kyojuro!

01:30:56.413 --> 01:30:58.833
Did he do it? Did he win?

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:28.904
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

01:31:35.453 --> 01:31:36.954
<i>No way!</i>

01:31:44.503 --> 01:31:46.964
Let's fight more.

01:31:47.757 --> 01:31:50.134
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

01:32:06.192 --> 01:32:07.610
<i>Rengoku...</i>

01:32:08.444 --> 01:32:09.904
<i>Rengoku!</i>

01:32:12.281 --> 01:32:13.824
<i>Rengoku!</i>

01:32:18.704 --> 01:32:25.044
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:32.510
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.804
But what about you?

01:32:34.845 --> 01:32:39.767
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs
and damaged internal organs...

01:32:39.809 --> 01:32:42.019
All irreparable.

01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:45.147
If you were a demon,
you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

01:32:45.481 --> 01:32:48.901
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

01:32:49.151 --> 01:32:53.114
You can struggle all you want,
but a human can never beat a demon.

01:32:55.533 --> 01:32:57.618
<i>I want to go help him!</i>

01:33:00.329 --> 01:33:02.790
<i>But there's no strength in my arms or legs.</i>

01:33:03.124 --> 01:33:05.167
<i>It's partly because of my injury,</i>

01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:08.254
<i>but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!</i>

01:33:21.767 --> 01:33:23.978
Kyojuro, why...

01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:26.564
I...

01:33:28.399 --> 01:33:30.985
I will fulfill my duty!

01:33:31.235 --> 01:33:34.613
I will not allow anyone here to die!

01:33:35.906 --> 01:33:39.452
<i>I'll damage his body
as much as I can in an instant!</i>

01:33:39.702 --> 01:33:40.870
<i>Flame Breathing...</i>

01:33:41.454 --> 01:33:42.705
<i>Esoteric Art!</i>

01:33:48.669 --> 01:33:51.005
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

01:33:51.046 --> 01:33:53.924
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

01:33:53.966 --> 01:33:55.968
That mental strength!

01:33:56.218 --> 01:33:58.971
That airtight stance!

01:34:01.348 --> 01:34:04.977
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

01:34:05.227 --> 01:34:08.230
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

01:34:08.564 --> 01:34:10.065
<i>Set your heart ablaze.</i>

01:34:11.066 --> 01:34:12.818
<i>Go beyond your limits!</i>

01:34:14.028 --> 01:34:16.030
I'm the Flame Hashira...

01:34:16.363 --> 01:34:18.073
Kyojuro Rengoku!

01:34:18.783 --> 01:34:19.992
Ninth Form...

01:34:20.743 --> 01:34:22.453
Rengoku!

01:34:22.703 --> 01:34:23.954
<i>Destructive Death...</i>

01:34:24.246 --> 01:34:25.581
<i>Annihilation Type!</i>

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:43.974
Rengoku!

01:35:17.216 --> 01:35:18.384
<i>Rengoku!</i>

01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:25.141
<i>Rengoku!</i>

01:35:27.601 --> 01:35:28.811
I see hi—

01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:29.895
Ren...

01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:31.272
goku...

01:35:42.032 --> 01:35:45.494
You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!

01:35:45.703 --> 01:35:47.204
Become a demon!

01:35:47.246 --> 01:35:49.206
Say that you'll become a demon!

01:35:49.248 --> 01:35:50.499
You are...

01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:53.878
strong and one of the chosen ones!

01:36:06.849 --> 01:36:07.975
Kyojuro...

01:36:08.017 --> 01:36:09.769
Yes, Mother?

01:36:10.811 --> 01:36:12.813
I want you to think hard...

01:36:13.147 --> 01:36:15.441
about what I'm about to ask you.

01:36:16.150 --> 01:36:21.405
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

01:36:25.367 --> 01:36:26.660
I don't know!

01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:30.164
So that you can save weaker people.

01:36:31.624 --> 01:36:36.712
Those who were born
blessed with more gifts than others

01:36:36.754 --> 01:36:42.676
are obligated to use those gifts
for the world and other people.

01:36:43.552 --> 01:36:51.435
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:57.650
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

01:36:58.359 --> 01:37:02.655
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

01:37:03.239 --> 01:37:07.118
Make sure you never forget that.

01:37:07.159 --> 01:37:08.702
I won't!

01:37:25.302 --> 01:37:29.265
I don't have much more time to live.

01:37:30.266 --> 01:37:34.979
I was blessed to be the mother
of such a strong and gentle child.

01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:38.816
I will entrust everything to you.

01:37:51.954 --> 01:37:53.122
<i>Mother...</i>

01:37:53.456 --> 01:37:58.544
<i>It was an honor for me
to have been born to such a person as you!</i>

01:38:06.552 --> 01:38:07.678
<i>He stopped it?</i>

01:38:08.095 --> 01:38:10.431
<i>What unbelievable strength!</i>

01:38:10.473 --> 01:38:13.684
<i>I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!</i>

01:38:15.352 --> 01:38:16.812
<i>Damn!</i>

01:38:17.104 --> 01:38:18.647
<i>It'll be daybreak soon!</i>

01:38:19.315 --> 01:38:21.984
<i>I have to kill him and get out of here!</i>

01:38:23.277 --> 01:38:24.236
<i>I can't...</i>

01:38:24.278 --> 01:38:25.571
<i>pull my arm out!</i>

01:38:27.907 --> 01:38:30.034
<i>I won't let you escape!</i>

01:38:36.916 --> 01:38:40.127
<i>No matter what Rengoku says...</i>

01:38:41.670 --> 01:38:42.838
<i>I have to...</i>

01:38:43.172 --> 01:38:44.548
<i>do it right now!</i>

01:38:45.382 --> 01:38:48.511
<i>I have to slice off the demon's head!</i>

01:38:48.844 --> 01:38:50.054
<i>Quickly!</i>

01:38:52.848 --> 01:38:54.600
<i>The sun's coming up!</i>

01:38:54.850 --> 01:38:57.353
<i>There'll be sunlight here!</i>

01:38:57.686 --> 01:38:58.854
<i>I have to get away!</i>

01:38:59.146 --> 01:39:00.856
<i>I have to get away!</i>

01:39:10.282 --> 01:39:12.326
<i>No way am I ever letting go!</i>

01:39:12.368 --> 01:39:15.371
<i>Not until I chop off your head!</i>

01:39:18.332 --> 01:39:20.543
Out of my way!

01:39:25.047 --> 01:39:26.966
Move, Inosuke!

01:39:27.675 --> 01:39:30.636
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

01:39:34.098 --> 01:39:36.725
<i>Beast Breathing, Fang One...</i>

01:39:37.184 --> 01:39:38.769
<i>Pierce!</i>

01:39:57.163 --> 01:40:00.291
<i>I have to find refuge from the sunlight!</i>

01:40:10.468 --> 01:40:12.011
<i>That took too long!</i>

01:40:12.052 --> 01:40:14.221
<i>I have to get away from the sun!</i>

01:40:21.312 --> 01:40:22.938
Don't run away!

01:40:23.522 --> 01:40:25.316
Don't run away, you coward!

01:40:25.357 --> 01:40:27.485
Don't run away!

01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:33.073
<i>What the hell is that brat talking about?</i>

01:40:33.115 --> 01:40:35.701
<i>Doesn't he have a brain in his head?</i>

01:40:35.743 --> 01:40:38.412
<i>I'm not running away from you!</i>

01:40:38.746 --> 01:40:40.956
<i>I'm running away from the sun!</i>

01:40:40.998 --> 01:40:44.251
<i>And besides,
the battle's already been decided!</i>

01:40:44.543 --> 01:40:47.922
<i>He'll run out of strength and die soon!</i>

01:40:50.466 --> 01:40:52.176
The Demon Slayer Corps...

01:40:52.551 --> 01:40:56.680
is always fighting you demons in the dark
of the night where you have the advantage!

01:40:56.722 --> 01:40:58.849
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

01:40:59.141 --> 01:41:01.268
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

01:41:01.519 --> 01:41:04.105
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

01:41:05.106 --> 01:41:06.941
Don't run away, you bastard!

01:41:07.399 --> 01:41:08.609
You bastard!

01:41:08.943 --> 01:41:10.694
You coward!

01:41:10.945 --> 01:41:15.241
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

01:41:15.282 --> 01:41:16.992
He's stronger!

01:41:17.243 --> 01:41:18.911
Rengoku didn't lose!

01:41:19.161 --> 01:41:21.163
He didn't let anybody die!

01:41:21.205 --> 01:41:24.792
He fought to the end!
He protected them to the end!

01:41:24.834 --> 01:41:26.919
You're the one who lost!

01:41:26.961 --> 01:41:30.798
It's Rengoku who won!

01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:07.710
Stop yelling already.

01:42:13.507 --> 01:42:15.384
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

01:42:16.051 --> 01:42:18.095
You're badly injured, too, remember?

01:42:19.305 --> 01:42:21.474
If you die, young Kamado,

01:42:21.932 --> 01:42:24.101
it'll mean I'm the loser.

01:42:26.061 --> 01:42:27.563
Rengoku...

01:42:28.856 --> 01:42:30.274
Come over here.

01:42:30.691 --> 01:42:33.110
Let's talk a bit one last time.

01:42:51.128 --> 01:42:53.130
There's something that I remembered...

01:42:54.673 --> 01:42:57.009
while I was dreaming.

01:42:58.135 --> 01:42:59.845
You should go to my parents' home,

01:43:00.471 --> 01:43:03.099
the Rengoku residence.

01:43:04.058 --> 01:43:07.561
There should be some notes there
left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

01:43:09.355 --> 01:43:11.524
My father read them often,

01:43:12.399 --> 01:43:15.986
but since I never did,
I don't know what's in them.

01:43:17.947 --> 01:43:25.955
There might be some kind of record
of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

01:43:27.373 --> 01:43:30.918
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.295
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

01:43:33.337 --> 01:43:35.631
Isn't there a way
to close up your wounds?

01:43:36.382 --> 01:43:37.550
No.

01:43:37.591 --> 01:43:40.261
I'll be dead soon.

01:43:42.221 --> 01:43:45.933
I'm going to tell you all I can
while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

01:43:47.768 --> 01:43:49.937
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

01:43:50.688 --> 01:43:52.606
to follow his heart...

01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:57.361
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:01.365
Tell my father...

01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:04.910
that I want him to take care of himself.

01:44:07.037 --> 01:44:08.164
One more thing.

01:44:09.331 --> 01:44:10.458
Young Kamado...

01:44:13.043 --> 01:44:15.463
I believe in your little sister.

01:44:16.422 --> 01:44:19.008
I accept her as a member
of the Demon Slayer Corps.

01:44:21.385 --> 01:44:26.682
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

01:44:27.683 --> 01:44:31.479
Anyone who risks their lives
fighting demons to protect humans...

01:44:31.854 --> 01:44:35.608
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

01:44:36.442 --> 01:44:38.694
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

01:44:43.699 --> 01:44:49.205
No matter how devastated you may be
by your own weakness or uselessness...

01:44:50.623 --> 01:44:52.291
set your heart ablaze.

01:44:55.377 --> 01:44:57.713
Grit your teeth
and look straight ahead.

01:44:59.173 --> 01:45:02.218
Even if you stop and crouch down,

01:45:02.259 --> 01:45:05.179
the time won't wait for you...

01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:09.183
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:13.479
Don't feel bad
that I'm going to die here.

01:45:14.105 --> 01:45:15.523
As a Hashira,

01:45:15.856 --> 01:45:18.734
of course I would shield my juniors.

01:45:19.276 --> 01:45:23.280
Any other Hashira
would've done the same thing.

01:45:24.115 --> 01:45:26.242
We never let the young buds get nipped.

01:45:27.535 --> 01:45:28.869
Young Kamado...

01:45:30.538 --> 01:45:32.123
Young Boar Head...

01:45:33.124 --> 01:45:34.416
Yellow Boy...

01:45:36.043 --> 01:45:38.045
Keep learning and grow.

01:45:38.838 --> 01:45:40.214
And then,

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.218
become the next Hashira
supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

01:45:45.719 --> 01:45:47.054
I believe in you.

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:50.599
I believe in you all.

01:46:16.417 --> 01:46:17.835
<i>Mother...</i>

01:46:22.465 --> 01:46:24.675
<i>Do you think I did it right?</i>

01:46:26.969 --> 01:46:30.473
<i>Did I carry out what I had to do...</i>

01:46:31.098 --> 01:46:32.892
<i>and my duties?</i>

01:46:42.276 --> 01:46:44.695
<i>You made me proud.</i>

01:47:21.107 --> 01:47:23.359
When the train went off the rails,

01:47:23.776 --> 01:47:26.445
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques.

01:47:27.071 --> 01:47:31.367
He must've kept the damage
to the cars to a minimum.

01:47:33.285 --> 01:47:34.912
I guess he did.

01:47:36.413 --> 01:47:38.707
I can't believe he's gone.

01:47:39.333 --> 01:47:42.002
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

01:47:42.294 --> 01:47:43.212
Yeah.

01:47:44.046 --> 01:47:46.382
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

01:47:47.049 --> 01:47:50.052
Was it that strong? I mean...

01:47:50.469 --> 01:47:51.637
Yeah.

01:47:54.056 --> 01:47:56.225
I'm so frustrated!

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.312
As soon as I master one thing,

01:48:01.272 --> 01:48:05.776
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

01:48:07.319 --> 01:48:12.241
while more powerful people
are fighting far beyond it.

01:48:13.117 --> 01:48:15.744
I just can't make it there yet!

01:48:17.121 --> 01:48:20.708
If I'm still stumbling around
in a place like this, can I...

01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:23.002
Can I...

01:48:25.796 --> 01:48:30.050
ever become like Rengoku?

01:48:40.311 --> 01:48:42.813
Stop whining already!

01:48:44.565 --> 01:48:48.778
Stop saying dumbass things
like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

01:48:48.819 --> 01:48:54.033
He said he believes in you, so just think
about how you're going to measure up to that!

01:48:54.074 --> 01:48:57.828
All living things just go back
to the earth when they die!

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.332
Sobbing or sniveling
won't bring them back!

01:49:01.624 --> 01:49:04.085
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

01:49:04.418 --> 01:49:07.671
No matter how pathetic
or humiliated you feel,

01:49:07.713 --> 01:49:10.091
you still have to go on living!

01:49:10.341 --> 01:49:11.967
But you're crying, too.

01:49:12.551 --> 01:49:15.721
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

01:49:16.597 --> 01:49:18.724
I'm not crying!

01:49:29.276 --> 01:49:31.987
Get over here!
We're gonna train!

01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:17.700
Is that so...

01:50:18.075 --> 01:50:20.035
Rengoku...

01:50:40.014 --> 01:50:44.685
So, even Rengoku couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

01:50:49.857 --> 01:50:51.692
I don't believe it.

01:50:58.657 --> 01:51:00.785
Namu Amida Butsu.

01:51:07.166 --> 01:51:11.796
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

01:51:19.595 --> 01:51:20.888
I see.

01:51:30.397 --> 01:51:35.236
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?

01:51:35.903 --> 01:51:38.239
Kyojuro did a great job, then.

01:51:38.614 --> 01:51:40.449
What a remarkable child.

01:51:41.867 --> 01:51:43.786
I'm not sad.

01:51:44.203 --> 01:51:47.123
I don't have much longer to live, either.

01:51:49.917 --> 01:51:53.295
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

01:51:53.712 --> 01:51:56.507
in the land of the dead.

01:52:08.102 --> 01:52:09.728
Rengoku...

01:52:11.105 --> 01:52:12.857
Rengoku...

01:52:15.359 --> 01:52:17.611
Rengoku!

01:52:26.323 --> 01:52:31.323
