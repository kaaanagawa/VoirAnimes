00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.230
Here goes...

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.400
Comin'...

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.400 line:20%
through!

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.770
Infuriating!

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.070
Infuriating!

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.870
Teruko!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.410
Hold onto the furniture!

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.870
That one's a demon
with supernatural powers!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.330
Stop launching those reckless assaults!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.010
EPISODE 12:
THE BOAR BARES ITS FANGS,
ZENITSU SLEEPS

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.310 line:20%
Infuriating!

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.480 line:20%
You damn insects
running amok in my house!

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.790
The room freakin' spun around!

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.130
This is fun! This is fun!

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.720 line:20%
Don't stomp all over her!

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.890
Who the hell are you?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.890
What do you think you're doing,
stepping on a little kid like that?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.230
I like it! I like it!

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.270
No human's ever sent me flying
like that before!

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.820
<i>Why is he coming after me?</i>

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.740
<i>Isn't he a Demon Slayer?</i>

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.820
My swords will hurt you.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.450
Because they're not the kind of swords
you little gentlemen use!

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.120
The way they shred through flesh...
That's what I pride myself on!

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.880
Knock it off! There's a demon
right there, you know!

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.550
Like I care!

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.130
Damn insects!

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.130
Out of my sight! Die!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.100
<i>The floor ripped apart all of a sudden!</i>

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.680
<i>At the same speed
as the sound of the tsuzumi!</i>

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.810
<i>In the shape of a beast's claws!</i>

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.190
<i>Spinning right!</i>

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.360
<i>Spinning left!</i>

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.780
Damn insects!

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.280
You damn miserable insects!

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.580
<i>I'm starting to get the hang of it now!</i>

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.880
<i>We're in yet another room now?</i>

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.970
<i>But what does this mean?</i>

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.180
<i>That demon didn't strike
his tsuzumi just now.</i>

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.310
<i>I'm picking up the scent
of multiple demons in this house.</i>

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.100
<i>Is there another demon
with a tsuzumi, then?</i>

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.360
<i>Is that why...</i>

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.940
<i>I can smell blood.</i>

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.950
It's gonna be all right, okay?

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.320
Just stay behind me.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200
Okay.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.960
<i>Another human ripped to shreds
and devoured!</i>

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.840
Wh-What's the matter?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.050
It's all right.
There are no demons around.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.220
Come on, let's head over there.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.140
Without a backward glance.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.180
Look straight ahead, okay?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.230
<i>Now there's another scent.</i>

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.110
<i>A unique scent of blood
I've never smelled before.</i>

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.240
<i>Looks like there wasn't that much bleeding.</i>

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.230
Excuse me, Zenitsu.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.120 line:20%
Signal... Signal... Signal... Signal me first!

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.740 line:20%
If you want to talk,
don't come at me all of a sudden!

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.540 line:20%
My heart nearly flew
out of my mouth just now!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.920 line:20%
I'm sorry.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.880 line:20%
If that had come to pass,

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.550 line:20%
that would've made you a murderer
for sure! Do you get that?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.800
It's just that... See...

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.220
You've been sweating, gasping
and shivering so horribly.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.010
What about it?
Aren't I doing the best I can here?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.100
Well, forgive me for saying so,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.560
but you're making me nervous, too, so...

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.560
Oh no! Sorry about that!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.940
Even still... Even still...

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.650
If we talk too much,
those demons and all will...

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.280
They might find us, right?

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.320
That's why...

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.700
I think it would be best
to be as quiet as possible! Right?

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.460 line:20%
A couple of kids.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.090 line:20%
Probably most agreeable to the tongue.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.510 line:20%
What did I tell you?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.970 line:20%
A demon showed up!
A demon showed up, understand?

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.970
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.980
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.820
Stay away! Stay away from us!

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.400
Stop that!

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.580
W-W-We don't taste good!
I'm sure I taste awful!

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.450
I'm serious, okay?
This kid's all skin and bones,

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.330
so he's all dry and tastes ghastly!

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.170
How will I know until I have a taste?

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.920
Nooooo!

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.090 line:20%
What was that? Quick-tongued!

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.800 line:20%
Splitting a vase in two!

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.970
That's just not possible!

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.190
Zenitsu! Get up!

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.650
It's in my knees now!
80 percent of my fear is in my knees!

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.280
This is no time to whine, all right?

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.400
Just leave me behind, okay?

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.280
Make a run for it!

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.950
I can't do something like that!

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.700
<i>What a great kid this is!</i>

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.500
<i>Even though I'm making
terrified sounds like this!</i>

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.290
<i>I gotta find a way somehow!</i>

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.750
<i>If I don't protect him,
what will become of him?</i>

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.800
<i>Dying before he reaches double digits
would be way too tragic!</i>

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.130
<i>But I'm so horribly weak!</i>

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.050
Get up!

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.720
<i>I don't have the ability to protect him!</i>

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.560
<i>But if I don't protect him...</i>

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.320 line:20%
I'm gonna guzzle your brain matter
through your ears!

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.570
Zenitsu!

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.740
Zenit—

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.580
<i>He's fast asleep.</i>

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.080
What's up with him?

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.810
Die!

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.730
Zenitsu!

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.400
Please wake up!

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.470
<i>Wh-What's this sound?</i>

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.930
<i>This guy...</i>

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.270
<i>He's giving off a different vibe!</i>

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.810
Zenitsu...

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.110
Thunder Breathing First Form,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.150
Thunderclap and Flash.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.300 line:20%
It's dead!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.300
All of a sudden, it's dead!

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.970
What the hell? I can't take this!

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.850
What is this? What is this? Yuck!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.770
Shoichi...

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.730
Don't tell me...

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.320
Thank you! You saved my life!

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.950
I shall be eternally grateful
to you for this!

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.320
Why didn't you tell me sooner
that you were so powerful?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.450
What are you talking about?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.040
Did you say something?

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.330
No.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.670
Uh, no. Forget it.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.800
Let's go now, okay?

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:58.800
Okay.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.760
Damn! He sent me flying again!

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.770
It's been like this
for the last three days, dammit!

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:10.520
Making my way
through a cramped building like this...

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.860
It's just not my thing
for crying out loud!

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.820
Hey, you dodged me.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.120
You seem to be a pretty fresh human.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.250
Your flesh will be well worth
gouging out!

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.010
Self-taught... Beast Breathing.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.340
It's gonna be so worth it
to shred such a huge target!

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.430 line:20%
You've got guts to charge me
head-on like that!

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.770 line:20%
Flaunt your corpse

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.820 line:20%
and serve as my springboard!

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.490
Fang Three Devour!

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.290
Comin' through! Comin' through!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.090
Marechi...

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.670
Marechi...

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.800
If I can just devour some...

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.340
Fifty...

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.800
No, a hundred humans' worth...

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.140
I gotta search for more humans
with marechi and consume them.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.810
That way...

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.820 position:20% line:50%
LOWER MOON SIX

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.270 line:20%

Kyogai.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.620
You can't eat any more?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.790
Is that all you've got?

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.540
No.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.050
No, I'm not done!

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.800
P-Please give me more time!

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.600
J-Just a little!

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.970
I've had enough.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.850
I'm stripping you of your number.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.480
That's your limit, and you've reached it.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.900 line:20%
<i>The more humans you devour,
the stronger you can become.</i>

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.610 line:20%
<i>And once he saw my potential,</i>

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.860 line:20%
<i>Master Kibutsuji was willing
to share his blood with me.</i>

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.950
<i>The power of that man's blood
was mind-boggling.</i>

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.460
<i>I was sure that I'd grow
infinitely stronger than ever before,</i>

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.840

of the Twelve Kizuki,</i>

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.420
<i>continue to gorge myself on humans</i>

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.970
<i>and become even more powerful!
Or so I believed!</i>

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.220
<i>Or so I believed.</i>

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.060
Brother Kiyoshi!

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.560
Brother!

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.060
Brother!

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.150
Teruko!

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.070 line:20%
Wh-Who's he?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.530
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.320
I've come to defeat evil demons.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.830
Now then, show my your wounds.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.080
Good for you
for hanging in there on your own.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.330
Brother...

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.630
Now this ointment here is amazing!

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.510
My master gave it to me!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.020
My master always wears a goblin mask.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.140
Goblin?

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.310
Really?

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.770
Yes, it's true.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.360
My master's ointment is so amazing,
it works in a split second.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.240
Okay, you're all set!

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.660
Well? The pain's gone, isn't it?

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:50.870
Yes!

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:55.540
Do you think you can you tell me
what happened here?

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.290
A monster dragged me away,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.960
a-and I nearly got devoured.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.630
But just then,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.300
another monster showed up
out of nowhere,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.390
a-and they started fighting to the death

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.100
over who was gonna get to e-eat me.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.980
A-And then,

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.360
the one with the tsuzumi
growing out of him...

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.490
When the other monster defeated him,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.910
he dropped a tsuzumi!

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.910
And when I picked it up and struck it,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.660
this room suddenly changed.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.330
And I somehow held on until now!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.250
A demon with tsuzumi
growing out of him...

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.840
So that was him?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.760
He mentioned marechi
or something like that.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.340
That's right!

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.890
He kept calling me "Marechi"!

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.310
What is "marechi"?

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.640
It refers to the owner of rare blood!

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.400
You little brats!

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.190
I'm going to peck you now.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.820
Cut it out!

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.280 line:20%
What do you mean by "rare blood"?

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.580 line:20%
The blood of all living species
can be categorized into types, idiot!

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.370
And the ultimate marechi...

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.500
The more scarce the blood,

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.250
the more uncommon...

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.330
For a demon!

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.500
A single marechi human has the same
nutritional value as eating fifty!

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.710
One hundred humans!

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.260
For demons, marechi is a feast!

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.010
Marechi is their favorite food!

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.780 line:20%
<i>Marechi...</i>

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.030 line:20%
<i>Marechi...</i>

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.740
I'm leaving this room now.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:57.950
Keep calm.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.290
It's all right.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.660
I'm just going to take down that demon.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.620
Listen to me, Teruko.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.340
Right now, your brother
is terribly exhausted.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.250
So, you gotta look after him, okay?

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.720
As soon as I leave the room,
strike that tsuzumi and move out.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.140
Just like Kiyoshi's been doing until now,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.520
whenever someone tries to open
the door or you hear something,

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.520
strike that tsuzumi right away
and make a run for it.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.310
I promise to come get you.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.570
I'll follow your scent.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.030
I'll call out your names
when I open the door.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.370
You just have to hold out a little longer.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.120
You can do it, right?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.080
Good for you!

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.620
You're so strong!

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.500
I'm heading out.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.010
Strike it!

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.350
Damn insects!

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.350
So infuriating!

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.700
<i>The tsuzumi on his right shoulder
flips the room right!</i>

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.170
<i>The left one flips it left!</i>

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.880
<i>Right leg, forward spin!</i>

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.800
<i>Left leg, backward spin!</i>

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.970
<i>The tsuzumi on his belly
launches that claw attack!</i>

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.110
<i>So fast!</i>

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.570
<i>The speed of the rotations
and attacks is devastating!</i>

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.820
<i>Miss Tamayo did treat my wounds,</i>

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.030
<i>but these injuries aren't fully healed yet!</i>

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.790
<i>Can I beat him?</i>

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.910
<i>Can I?</i>

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.920 line:20%
<i>These injuries hurt so bad
I can hardly stand it!</i>

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.920
<i>All this time, I've just been enduring it!</i>

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.390
<i>When I pulled Zenitsu off that girl,</i>

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.890
<i>when I shouted out,
I was enduring the most terrible pain!</i>

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.020
<i>I was able to withstand it
because I'm the eldest son!</i>

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.770
<i>But I couldn't have
if I were the second son!</i>

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.400
<i>Whenever I dig in,</i>

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.860
<i>the broken parts creak,
and I can't muster any strength.</i>

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.530
<i>That demon's attack is leaving scars
that look like claw marks.</i>

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.830
<i>It scares me so much
that I can't move in closer!</i>

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.000
<i>Since I'm not at full strength,</i>

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.040
<i>if I charge forward
to get within striking distance,</i>

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.840
<i>a flash of pain makes me stumble!</i>

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.130
<i>I'll get sliced into rings!</i>

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.850
<i>My injuries are making me
imagine the most awful things!</i>

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.390
<i>Mr. Urokodaki!</i>

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.940
<i>Water can change into any form.</i>

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.440
<i>Pour it into a container,
and it's a square.</i>

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.690
<i>Pour it into a bottle, and it's round.</i>

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.280
Sometimes, it can even smash boulders
and flow away as far as the eye can see.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.830
<i>That's right!</i>

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.160
<i>That's right!</i>

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.540
<i>There are ten Water Breathing forms!</i>

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.040
<i>So, I can battle any kind of opponent!</i>

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.250
<i>If you're hurt,</i>

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.710
<i>then make a move
that will compensate for it!</i>

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.760
<i>I can take on any form!</i>

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.800
<i>And this flow will never be stopped!</i>

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.060 line:20%
<i>Right now, it's not just my bones!
My heart's also been broken!</i>

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.810
<i>A broken Tanjiro's not gonna do any good!</i>

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.400
<i>All right! If you could
please quiet down!</i>

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.030
<i>Look straight ahead!</i>

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.490
<i>Rouse yourself!</i>

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.530 line:20%
<i>Give it all you've got, Tanjiro!</i>

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.740 line:20%
<i>Give it all you've got!</i>

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.830
I've done a good job until now!

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.040
I have what it takes!

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.340
And not today...

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.170
or any time in the future!

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.130
Even if I'm broken...

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.640
I'll never give up no matter what!

PREVIEW

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.530
Give it all you've got, Tanjiro!
Give it all you've got!

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.820
I'm the eldest son, so I can endure it!

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.320
You're gonna cheer me on,
too, right, Nezuko?

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.320
Thanks, Nezuko!

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.700
Okay, to show my gratitude,
I'm gonna cheer you on, too!

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.080
Give it all you've got, Nezuko!
Give it all you've got!

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.580
You'll never give up no matter what!

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.500
You're the eldest daughter,
but if anything bad happens to you,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.210
don't endure it. Just tell me, okay?

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.640
Next, Episode 13,
"Something More Important Than Life."

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.890
Looks like we've run out of time
for the Taisho secret!
