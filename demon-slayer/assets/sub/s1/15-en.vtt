WEBVTT

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.770
Tanjiro...

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.530
Listen to me...

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.620 line:20%
Demon Slayer Corps
is not something you'd join for fun!

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.500 line:20%
Guys like you gotta be purged!

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.750
Immediately!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Don't ever underestimate the Corps!

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.390
WISTERIA

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.030
Nezuko!

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.990
Nezuko!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.750
Nezuko!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.170
Nezuko!

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.050
Zenitsu! Stop following her already!

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.060
Tan... ji... ro!

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.810
Let's be friends, Tanjiro!

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.650
Zenitsu! Don't keep chasing us! I beg you!

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.820
Oh, don't be like that, Tanjiro!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.490
Nezuko!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.950
- Tanjiro!
- Stop!

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.370
Nezuko!

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.160
Tanjiro!

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.830
Man, I'm hungry.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.080
Pardon me, sir.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.470
Those clothes of yours
are quite soiled, I see.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.850 line:20%
I'll clean them for you,
so please wear these in the meanwhile.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.770
These are pleasant to the touch
and quite comfortable.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.280
How does tempura for dinner sound?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.660
You know, something
covered with batter and fried.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.040
Hey, wait up!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.380
Come back here, Nezuko!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.970
Wh-What was that for?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.720 line:20%
Hold up! Hold up!

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.520 line:20%
Stop chasing us, Inosuke!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.020 line:20%
Tanjiro!

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.030
EPISODE 15:
MOUNT NATAGUMO

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.450
You're fully healed.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.600
North-northeast! North-northeast!

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.310
Your next mission is north-northeast!

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.480 line:20%
The three of you are to go to Mt. Natagumo!

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.070 line:20%
Head to Mt. Natagumo!

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.580
We're heading out now.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.450
Thank you for everything.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.090
Now then, for good luck.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.960
Thank you so much!

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.680 line:20%
What do you think you're doing, old hag?

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.100
What are you, a moron?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.690
She's striking sparks for good luck!
It's a purification ceremony!

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.360
Because we're gonna go
on a dangerous mission!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.450 line:20%
Always live your lives
with great pride.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.820
I wish you luck in battle!

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.300 line:20%
"Great pride"? "Luck in battle"?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.470 line:20%
What does that mean?

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.890
<i>Jeez, this guy is totally clueless.</i>

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.850
Well, yeah, now that you mention it,
it's kind of difficult.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.480
"With great pride"...

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.610
I guess it means
that you know your place

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.690
and that you behave properly
so that you're never ashamed of yourself.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.910
And the old lady
is also praying for our safety.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.030
So, what is this "place"?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.160
What do you mean, "never ashamed"?

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.330
Well, it's...

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.670
What exactly does it mean
to "behave properly"?

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.920
Why in the hell would that old hag
pray for our safety anyway?

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.470
She has nothing to do with us.
Then, why?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.010
She has no clue
what her own place is, does she?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.270
<i>He sped up!</i>

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.480 line:20%
I won't get beat!

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.980 line:20%
Wait up!

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.450
Hold up!

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.330
Would you mind waiting a second?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.580
Zenitsu? What's wrong?

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.040
I'm scared, all right?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.080
Now that we're nearing
our destination, I'm so scared!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.670
Why the hell is he sitting?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.630
How creepy is that?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.090
Who are you to talk, Pig Face?

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.850
Don't tell me you're not getting
any vibes from that mountain!

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.610
Still, what good will it do
to just sit there?

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.030
I told you, he's creepy.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.570
I am not in any way creepy!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.240
I'm normal! I'm the normal one!
You guys are abnormal!

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.830
What? What's wrong?

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:04.880
Hey...

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.630
What is this smell?

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.050
Tanjiro!

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.670
Come on!
Don't leave me here by myself!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.760
Don't leave me!

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.440
H-Help me.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.320
He's got our uniform on!

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.490
He's a Demon Slayer!

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.030
Something must've happened!

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.370
Hold up!

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.580
Are you all right?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.160 line:20%
What happened?

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.670
They were attached to me, too!

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.840
Help me!

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.730
I'm going.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.780
I'll go on ahead.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.530
You can follow me, shivering.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.530 line:20%
This is making me hungry.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.620
Inosuke...

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.870
This is challenging enough for you, right?

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.790
Let's go!

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.400
What the hell is this?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.990
A spider web?

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.410
Jeez, this place is full of spider webs!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.870
What a pain!

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120
You're right.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.790
Inosuke?

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.300
What do you want?

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.260
Thanks.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.760
You said you'd come with me,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.340
and I felt encouraged.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.100
That twisted, ominous scent
I was picking up from the mountain...

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.890
It made me freeze a little.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.810
Thanks!

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.570
<i>These are pleasant to the touch
and quite comfortable.</i>

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.410
<i>Always live your lives with great pride.</i>

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.450
<i>I wish you luck in battle!</i>

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.370
Inosuke...

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.630
Let's go.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.680
We've come for backup.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.100
I'm Tanjiro Kamado, Rank Mizunoto.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.860
Mizunoto...

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.110
Mizunoto?

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:00.950
Why didn't they send a Hashira?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.700
No matter how many Mizunoto
they send, it won't help!

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:04.950
It's pointless!

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.790
Inosuke!

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.870
Shut up!

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.250
As far as pointlessness goes,
your existence itself has no point at all!

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.090 line:20%
Now, tell us what's going on,
you spineless fool!

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.050 line:20%
Who the hell is this guy?

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.380 line:20%
Did you forget that I have seniority?

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.890 line:20%
Th-The crow gave us the order!

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.890
And ten of us Demon Slayers came here.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.650
Not long after we entered the mountain,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.150
the Slayers...

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.460
The Slayers started killing each other!

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.430
I...

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.810
I...

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.440
You did well to return.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.530
So, most of my children
have been slaughtered?

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.450
We might find
the Twelve Kizuki there, then.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.710
It seems I'll have to send in
some Hashiras.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.590
Giyu...

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.720
Shinobu...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:48.680
- As you wish!
- As you wish!

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.680 line:20%
If only humans and demons
could get along.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.020 line:20%
Don't you agree, Tomioka?

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.310 line:20%
Impossible...

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.730 line:20%
as long as demons eat humans.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.910
<i>I wonder if they hate me.</i>

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.580
<i>Would you really leave your friend
by the roadside?</i>

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.170
<i>Wouldn't you talk him through it
if you were friends?</i>

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.630
<i>If they both tried to talk me into going,</i>

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.050 line:20%
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.670 line:20%
<i>Zenitsu...</i>

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.220
<i>I would've gone, okay? Sure I would.</i>

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.720
<i>But no, off they went on their merry way
up that scary mountain.</i>

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.480
<i>Poor me left alone here...</i>

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.150
"Sulking isn't going to do you any good.
You have to go help your friends now."

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.410
Lucky you, you don't have
a care in the world.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.910
You don't understand a thing
about humans, do you?

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.160
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.170
You're not cute at all!
I mean it! Not that side of you!

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.670
Seriously, you've got zero charm!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.510
I mean, look how cute Nezuko is,
and she's a demon!

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.670
But you're a sparrow,
and you're so vicious!

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.760 line:20%
He took Nezuko with him!

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.140
Why did he have to take
my precious Nezuko with him?

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.520
Damn Tanjiro!

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.150
Don't take a young girl into danger!
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.190
Nezuko!

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.040
What is this sound?

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.660
There it is again.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.540
It's this sound again!

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.210
I heard this sound,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.550
and the next thing I knew,
everyone started killing each other!

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.090
Where's it coming from?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.640
These guys are all morons!

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.390
They don't know that it's taboo
for us Demon Slayers to fight each other!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.310
No, that's not it!

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.810
They're not moving normally!

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.140
They're being manipulated
by something!

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.440
All right.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.400
I'm gonna slash them to ribbons!

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.650
You can't do that!

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.650
They're alive!

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.780
Some of them are still alive!

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.660
Besides, we can't harm
the corpses of our teammates!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.160
Stop denying me

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.160 line:20%
at every turn!

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.350
<i>A strange sweet scent from his back!</i>

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.900
It's threads!
They're being manipulated by threads!

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.400
Slash the threads!

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.160
I already knew that
before you caught on!

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.290
<i>Where's the location
of the demon controlling them?</i>

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:51.460
<i>What's this? What an irritating odor!
Though it was just for a second!</i>

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.380
<i>What's this?</i>

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.060
<i>Spiders!</i>

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.730
<i>So, the spiders are attaching them
to the puppet strings?</i>

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.570
<i>That means...</i>

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.330
Now then, my sweet little dolls...

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.460
Dance until your arms and legs fall off.

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.920
It's not good enough
to just cut the threads!

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.380
The spiders are just gonna stick
more puppet strings onto them!

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.420
So...

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.010
<i>That acrid smell again!</i>

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.380
<i>What is it anyway?</i>

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.430
<i>It's being carried here by the wind!</i>

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.100
So, all we gotta do
is kill those damn spiders, huh?

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.430
That would be impossible!

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.100
Those spiders are tiny,
and I'm sure there are tons of them!

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.070
We gotta find the demon
who's controlling them!

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.240
It's no good, Inosuke!

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.700
Inosuke, if you have some kind of power
that can pinpoint the demon's location,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.250
then help me out!

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.620
This weird smell has been flowing in,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.000
and my nose isn't working great!

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.590
And also, um...

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.710
It's Murata!

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.210
Murata!

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.970
Murata and I will find a way to deal
with the people being controlled!

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.220
Inosuke, you...

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.820
Don't disturb my family's peaceful life.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.070
<i>He's floating!</i>

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.120
<i>No.</i>

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.870
<i>He's standing on the threads!</i>

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.750
<i>What did he mean by "family"?</i>

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.000 line:20%
Mother will kill you all right away.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.500
Mother?

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.810
Damn you!

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.140
Where the hell do you think
you're going? Fight me! Fight—

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.650
Inosuke!

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.400 line:20%
Why did he show up anyway?

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:20.650 line:20%
That kid probably isn't the demon pulling
the puppet strings! So, first, let's...

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.280
Okay, okay, okay!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.030
I hear you, all right?

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:27.200
You want me to find
where that demon's at, right?

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.330
Shut up already, Forehead!

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.340
<i>Beast Breathing Seventh Form,</i>

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.340
<i>Spatial Awareness!</i>

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:07.780 line:20%
Found it!

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.410
There you are!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.380
I won't let anyone get in our way.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.510
The five of us are going to live
in bliss as a family.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.800
No one can break our bond.

PREVIEW

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.190
Whoops-a-daisy!

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440
Nezuko!

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.820
Tanjiro!

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.150
Where are you?

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.280
"First, let's calm down
and listen to the sounds around us!"

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.660
Nezuko's in danger!

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.660
Stop chirping and help me
find her, Chuntaro!

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.910
"I told you to calm down!"

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.410
"Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!"

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.540
"My real name is Ukogi."

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.880
"That's because my favorite food
is ukogi rice."

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.090
"But Zenitsu hasn't noticed yet,
so all I get is beans."

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.170
What are you so mad about?
Here, eat this and calm down.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.670
"It's an ukogi rice ball!"

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.920 line:20%
When you're done with that,
help me look, okay?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.720 line:20%
I mean, Nezuko's in danger!

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.470
"He's seriously worried."

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.220 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.180
"I guess this is why
you just can't hate the guy."

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.810
Next, Episode 16,

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.810
"Letting Someone Else Go First."
