00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.190
It's about time for you to die!

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.700
<i>Twist!</i>

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.370
<i>Envelope!</i>

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.370
<i>Twisting Whirlpool-Flowing Water!</i>

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.630
<i>My sword's so heavy!</i>

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.300
<i>But...</i>

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.010
<i>Second Form...</i>

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.130
<i>Improved,</i>

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600
<i>Lateral Water Wheel!</i>

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.990
EPISODE 10:
TOGETHER FOREVER

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.130 line:20%
<i>I did it!</i>

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.420 line:20%
<i>The Whirlpool move loses force
when it's not underwater!</i>

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.130 line:20%
<i>But thanks to my opponent's attack,
it gained power,</i>

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.090 line:20%
<i>and I was able to envelope the arrows!</i>

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.430
Damn!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.020
Curse you! Curse you! Curse you!

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.230
All I had to do
was bring back your head,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.020
and I would've won his approval!

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.230
I'll never forgive you!

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
I'll never ever forgive you!

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.030
Shoving my face into this vile dirt!

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.780 line:20%
You're going down with me!

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.040
<i>Oh no! He's gonna get me!</i>

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.000 line:20%
<i>I'm getting pulled by a force
stronger than the arrows he's hit me with!</i>

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.670
<i>I gotta unleash move after move
and go on the defensive,</i>

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.170
<i>or my body's going to get smashed!</i>

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.130 line:20%
Fourth Form,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.550
Striking Tide!

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.010 line:20%
<i>The pressure is bearing down on my body,</i>

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.930
<i>and I can't swing my sword!</i>

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.270
<i>Unleash one!</i>

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.100
<i>Unleash a move!</i>

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.730
<i>Not here!</i>

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.190
<i>Don't let yourself get beat!</i>

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.940
<i>Second Form,</i>

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.650 line:20%
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.490
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.200
Water Surface Slash!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.210
Drop Ripple Thrust-curve!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.870
Whirlpool!

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.500
<i>I've never made this
many consecutive moves before!</i>

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.920
<i>It feels like both my arms
are about to get torn off!</i>

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.090 line:20%
Nowhere near enough!

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.510 line:20%
More...

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.470 line:20%
Suffer more!

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.230
<i>How many more times?</i>

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.150
<i>How many?</i>

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440
<i>Don't think about it!</i>

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.400
<i>Just keep unleashing moves!</i>

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.570
<i>Keep throwing them out!</i>

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.290
Not yet!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.040
It's still not enough yet!

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.270
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480
<i>Miss Tamayo...</i>

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.020
<i>Yushiro...</i>

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.690
<i>I've got a broken rib and leg.</i>

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.580 line:20%
<i>N-No good!</i>

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.160 line:20%
<i>I'm too exhausted to grip my sword!</i>

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.630
<i>I gotta get over there!</i>

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.630
<i>There's still one more demon!</i>

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.800
<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.220
<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.140
<i>So be safe, all right?</i>

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.390
<i>Please...</i>

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.890
<i>be safe!</i>

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.530 line:20%
Ridiculous!

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.070 line:20%
It's child's play for me
to evade a linear attack like this!

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.160 line:20%
Locating you is a breeze, as well!

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.580 line:20%
<i>The same goes for you!</i>

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.250
<i>No matter how well
you might conceal yourself,</i>

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.460
<i>I can see you clear as day!</i>

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.810
What fun this is!

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.810
Hey you!

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.690
Don't be so rash
just because you're immortal!

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.940
Wh-What's wrong?

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.740
What do you think you're doing?
Here it comes!

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.750
Look at her.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.290
Lady Tamayo...

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.510
<i>You little brat!</i>

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.220
<i>You little brat!</i>

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.020
<i>So, now you can kick
my temari back at me?</i>

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.940
<i>How insolent!</i>

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.710
You damn brat!

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.210
Unbelievable.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.470
Lady Tamayo, is this...

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.090
I used a healing serum on her.
Nothing more.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.600
Made exclusively for demons.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.770
It doesn't make one physically stronger.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.480
What we're seeing
is Nezuko's own power.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.190
Without devouring human blood...

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.190
Solely on her own...

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.320
Nezuko is gaining strength at a rapid rate.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.000
<i>However, her opponent
is also formidable.</i>

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.420
<i>If she were to go all-out,
Nezuko wouldn't stand a chance.</i>

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.050
<i>I've got to...</i>

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.050
<i>do something.</i>

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.680
You're an amusing little girl!

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.100
This time, I'm going all-out against you!

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.600
I wonder how long you can hold out!

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.400
Twelve Kizuki demon girl there.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.740
You're in my way!
Step back, you damn fugitive!

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.530
Just tell me one thing please.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.580
Are you aware of Kibutsuji's true identity?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.330
What the hell did you say?

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.290
That man is nothing but a coward.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.340
He lives in constant fear of something.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.590
Stop it!

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.510
Damn you! Stop it!

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.760
Do you know why it is
that demons can't band together?

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.560
The reason why demons
cannibalize each other?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:08.400
It's to prevent other demons
from banding together and attacking him.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.190
He manipulates demons to act this way.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.610
Demons like you.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.700
Shut up!

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.370
Shut up, shut up!

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.870
No way is he that petty!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.870 line:20%
<i>Lady Tamayo...</i>

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.080
<i>is casting a spell.</i>

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.540
The power he wields is mind-blowing!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.250
There's no one stronger than him!

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:33.880
Not Lord Kibutsuji!

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.390
You've uttered that name
out loud, haven't you?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.900
That will trigger the curse.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.900 line:20%
<i>Magical Aroma of Daylight.</i>

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.400 line:20%
<i>It weakens its target's brain functions,</i>

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.320
<i>rendering that person
unable to lie or keep secrets.</i>

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.660
<i>It's immensely potent, Lady Tamayo!</i>

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.170 line:20%
I do feel sorry for you, but...

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.420 line:20%
farewell.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.800
Please forgive me!

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.420
Please forgive me!

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.180
I'm begging you! Please!
Please forgive me!

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.230
Did she just die?

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.900
She will die momentarily.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.360
That's the curse.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:02.660
Her physical body will be destroyed
by Kibutsuji's cells still in her body.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.780
In general,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.410
battles between demons are futile.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.410 line:20%
It's pointless.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.920 line:20%
Because they can't inflict
fatal wounds on each other.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.760 line:20%
Only sunlight and the swords
of the Demon Slayers can do so.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.720
Kibutsuji alone appears
to be able to destroy demon cells.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.690
Don't go inhaling Lady Tamayo's spell!

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.730
It's harmful to the human body!

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.110
You got that?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.740
Tanjiro...

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.120
She is not one of the Twelve Kizuki.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.620
The Twelve Kizuki have numbers
engraved on their eyeballs,

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.370
but this demon doesn't have one.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.130
Most likely,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.670
the other demon isn't a member
of the Twelve Kizuki, either.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.300
They're too weak.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.920
Too weak?

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:04.180
At that level?

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.510
If Lady Tamayo says so,
there's no mistake.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.770
Still, who knew
there were such stupid demons?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.810
She physically injured Lady Tamayo.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.100
She got exactly what she deserved.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.070
I hope this blood will be instrumental
in developing the healing serum.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.950
I'm going to take care of Nezuko.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.460
Not only did I medicate her,
she also inhaled my spell inadvertently.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.380
I'm so sorry.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.960
Don't move a muscle!

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:43.460
You're on your own now!

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.760
I don't want to leave
Lady Tamayo's side!

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:46.970
Not for a second!

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.980 position:80% line:20%
DESTROY

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.980
Ma... ri...

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.610
Mari...

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.030
Mari...

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.250
Here's your mari.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.540
Play with me.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.460
Play with me.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.340
<i>You're just like a little kid.</i>

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.890
<i>Even though you must've murdered
scores of people.</i>

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.700
<i>You were deluded into thinking
you were in the Twelve Kizuki.</i>

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.620
<i>Deceived... Compelled to fight...</i>

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.250
<i>And now,</i>

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.630
<i>you were killed by the Kibutsuji curse.</i>

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.380
<i>There's no salvation.</i>

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.380
<i>Even after you die,
not even your bones will remain.</i>

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.930
<i>Is this the price you pay
for killing others?</i>

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.280 line:20%
<i>Kibutsuji...</i>

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.070 line:20%
<i>This is how that man treats
even those who revere him!</i>

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.120 line:20%
<i>He's a true...</i>

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.450 line:20%
<i>demon!</i>

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.720
Miss Tamayo!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.100
Yushiro?

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.720
Over here! Over here!

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.350
Not that you need to come at all.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.060
But if you want to,
then get down here.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:06.860
Yushiro!

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.400
Only joking!

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.490
Hurry down, then, Tanjiro!

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.240
Oh, right!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.960
Nezuko!

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.960
I moved her to this basement,

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.460
where the sunlight won't reach her,
ahead of daybreak.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:33.090
Nezuko?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.970
Why, you!

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.770
Step away from Lady Tamayo!

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.020
That's so rude!

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.900
Stop it, Yushiro.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.900
I don't mind at all.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.400
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.860
<i>You have such a kind heart,
Lady Tamayo.</i>

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.860
<i>You're too beautiful to believe!</i>

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.910
Cut... that... out!

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.540
Nezuko has been acting in this way
since she awoke.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.870
Do you think she's all right?

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.500
There's nothing to worry about.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:07.790
She's fine.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.300
She probably thinks
you're someone in our family.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.930
Cut it out!

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.720
Family?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.260
But I thought the spell
Nezuko is under

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.930
causes her to see humans
as her family.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.940 line:20%
And Yushiro and I are demons.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.940 line:20%
Cut it out!

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.940
But Nezuko has perceived
you two as humans.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.940
That's why she tried to protect you.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.620
At first, I didn't like the idea
of Nezuko being under a spell,

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.830
but since it looks like she has
a will of her own, I'm glad that—

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.210
I-I'm so sorry! Nezuko!

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.300
Nezuko! S-Step away from her!

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.090
It's rude, all right?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.130
Thank you...

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.720
Nezuko!

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.510
Thank you!

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.940
<i>Do you still wish to live?</i>

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.490
<i>Do you still wish to live
even if you're no longer human?</i>

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.290
<i>If this goes on, you will most likely
succumb to your illness.</i>

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.170
<i>However,</i>

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.630 line:20%
<i>losing your humanity
will cause you pain and grief.</i>

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.550
<i>Do you still wish to live?</i>

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.560
Yushiro and I will leave this region.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.440
We've gotten too close to Kibutsuji.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.240
We must conceal our whereabouts soon
or the risk will be too great.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.950
Not to mention, even if I think
I've concealed my identity,

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.200
when I interact with humans as a doctor,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.700
people sometimes
see through me as a demon.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.290
The young and the elderly
are particularly perceptive.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.460
Tanjiro...

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:13.710
Yes?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.840
Would you like us to take Nezuko in?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.510
I can't give you an absolute guarantee
that she'll be safe,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.520
but I believe it will be less dangerous
than taking her into battle.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.770
<i>That might be true.</i>

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.690
<i>She's right. It would be better
for Nezuko to be in their care.</i>

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.300
Miss Tamayo, thank you so much
for your concern.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.300
But...

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.680 line:20%
Nezuko and I are staying together.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.390 line:20%
We're not going to live
apart from each other.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.640
Never again.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.690
Very well.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.860
In that case, I wish you
long-lasting good fortune in battle.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.020
All right.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.280
We'll be leaving after we erase
all traces of ourselves.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.910
You two get going now!

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:24.370
Right!

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.830
Okay, Miss Tamayo, Yushiro,
we wish you well!

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.210
Let's go, Nezuko.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:33.210
Hey!

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.880
Don't go rushing off like that!

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.960
Tanjiro!

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.550
Your kid sister...

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.390
is a beauty.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.810
South-southeast! South-southeast!
South-southeast!

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.530
Your next location is south-southeast!

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.740
I heard you!

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.610
I heard, so give me a break
and quiet down!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.740
I'm begging you!

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.830
I got the message, so please!

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.120
Please!

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.410
Please! Please! Please!

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.080
Please marry me!

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.210
I could die any day, you know!

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:21.210
That's why I want you to marry me!

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.180
So please! Please, I'm begging you!

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.340
Wh-What's up with that?

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.390
What on earth?

PREVIEW

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:13.330 position:20% line:20%
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.650
South-southeast! South-southeast!

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.610
I mean, I just fought!
When can I get some sleep?

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.570
What? I nailed it?

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.580
Not that I was really trying to or anything.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.950
First, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.580
The Demon Slayer Corps' messengers,
the Kasugai Crows, each have a name.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.380
I hear that mine is named
Matsuemon Tennouji.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.000
Okay, one last impression.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.300
"This is your first assignment
as a Demon Hunter!"

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.800
Hey! We've been fighting constantly
from the start!

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.640
Next, Episode 11, "Tsuzumi Mansion"!

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.060
This isn't really the time
for a festival, is it?

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.020
