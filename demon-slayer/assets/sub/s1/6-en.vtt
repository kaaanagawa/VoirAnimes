DESTROY

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.570
Have you gotten changed?

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.690
Yes.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.980
EPISODE 6:
SWORDSMAN ACCOMPANYING A DEMON

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.020
Tanjiro...

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.030
Now that you're starting out
with the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.780
I'd like to explain a few things to you.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.240
Right.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.410
That Demon Slayer Corps outfit
you're wearing right now...

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620
It's made of a special kind of fiber.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.630
The fabric is quite breathable,
yet it repels moisture and won't burn easily.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.630
A low-level demon's talons or fangs
couldn't even manage to tear that uniform.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.090
It's that strong?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.890
Also,

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.600
that Nichirin Sword of yours...

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.140
The color varies from owner to owner,
and each hue has unique properties.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.940 line:20%
But since not many people end up with
black blades, little is known about them.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150
So little, in fact, that—

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.700
So little is known that...
What, Mr. Urokodaki?

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.200
Since so little is known about them,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.500
black blades are said to be wielded
by swordsmen who'll never go far.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.290
I don't know how I'll do
in the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.920
but I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human no matter what.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.640
Yes, you're right.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.760
I have faith
that you're going to make that happen.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.260
Right.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.140
One more thing.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.350
Take this.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.650
It's a box for you
to carry your sister in during the day.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.150
Built out of an extremely light wood
called "Cloud Mist Pine."

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.780
I coated it with rock lacquer
to reinforce its exterior

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.660
and to make it even more durable.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.910
Thank you very much!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.580
It's so light!
It's really light, Mr. Urokodaki!

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.340
Nezuko!

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.260
Get inside this, will you?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.220
Can you do it?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.990
Nezuko, from now on,
we're always gonna be together, okay?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.240
All right, I'll be going now.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.620
Hold on. Do you mind?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.110
Nezuko, are you all right?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.580
Nezuko?

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540 line:20%
<i>I'm just guessing here,</i>

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.750 line:20%
<i>but it could be that Nezuko's recovering
her strength by sleeping</i>

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.800
<i>instead of consuming human flesh.</i>

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.390
Nezuko...

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.770
You get lots of rest.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.750
Could this be the town to the northwest?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.860
Oh, look, there's Kazumi.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.110
Poor thing. He looks so haggard.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.160
Because he was with Satoko
when she was taken.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.170
Night after night... It's so creepy.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.340
It's so dreadful!

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.890
When night falls,
yet another young girl will be abducted!

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.350
Mr. Kazumi!

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
If you don't mind,
I'd like to hear your story.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.150
Is that all right?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.290
This is where Satoko vanished.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.660
You may not believe me.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.170
I do believe you!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.420
I believe you, all right!

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.250
I believe you!

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.350
<i>There's still a faint trace of demon scent,</i>

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.230
<i>but it's uneven, so to speak.</i>

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.360 line:20%
<i>There's something strange about this.</i>

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.490
<i>Who is this kid anyway?</i>

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.370
<i>How dare you!</i>

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.960
<i>What do you mean, "vanished"?</i>

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.500
<i>You bastard!</i>

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.710
<i>Dear!</i>

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.460
<i>That's enough! Please stop!</i>

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.270
I want you to believe me.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.100
She really did vanish.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.440
I believe you.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.780
After all, that's why I'm here.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.780
You're gonna keep going?

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.490
Yes.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.910
Look how late it's gotten.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.370
I'm flattered
that you're so concerned for me,

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.630
but shouldn't you pick up
again tomorrow and get some rest?

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.550
Those things are active during the night.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.680
So, I can't afford to rest.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.640
I've detected a new scent in this area.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.810
It's gotta be somewhere nearby.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.270
Those things...

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.360
Don't tell me you're...

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.980
You're seriously...

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.240
How terrifying.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.160
I want you to stay indoors
for the time being.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.910
Yes, Mother.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.330
Now then, good night.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.950
I wonder what became of the girls
who were taken.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.540
I just hope they're all right.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.700
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160
<i>So fast!</i>

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.670
The scent just got stronger!

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.540
The demon's at large!

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.630
<i>He jumped?</i>

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.260
<i>He spoke of demons.</i>

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.260
<i>The Demon Slayer Corps...</i>

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.930
<i>He really...</i>

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.020
<i>This is it.</i>

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.400
<i>They're here right now!</i>

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.870
<i>Two different scents.</i>

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.950
<i>A demon and a female human!</i>

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.870
<i>They're nowhere to be seen.</i>

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.090
<i>But...</i>

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.930
<i>The spot where the scent is strongest...</i>

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.510 line:20%
<i>is right here!</i>

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.040 line:20%
<i>A morphed demon!</i>

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.500 line:20%
<i>The demons who use a special spell
called the "Blood Demon Art"</i>

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.010 line:20%
<i>possess supernatural abilities.</i>

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.680
<i>You may have to fight those demons,
as well, from now on.</i>

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600 line:20%
Where are those girls you kidnapped?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.310
I've got two more questions for you!

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.450
Who was that?

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.660
Mr. Kazumi,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.710
Please hold this person and stand nearby.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.790
If you're inside my range of attack,
I can protect you!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.920
<i>From the ground or this wall...</i>

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.380
<i>It can probably emerge from anywhere.</i>

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.600 line:20%
<i>There's also the chance
that it could show up out of thin air.</i>

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.730
<i>But this demon...</i>

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.650
<i>Even when it's submerged,
it can't erase its scent!</i>

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:46.900 line:20%
<i>Here it comes!</i>

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:48.860
<i>Water Breathing,</i>

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.200
<i>Fifth Form!</i>

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.910
<i>There's three of them!</i>

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.580
<i>Settle down!</i>

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.330 line:20%
<i>You can do it!</i>

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.300
<i>Eighth Form...</i>

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.720
<i>Waterfall Basin!</i>

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.970
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.980
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.070
<i>Tanjiro, listen to me closely.</i>

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:31.410
<i>The type of demon with the blood
that can turn humans into demons...</i>

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.870
<i>There's only one in this world.</i>

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.990
<i>Just one...</i>

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.540
<i>The one who was the first
to become a demon</i>

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.170
<i>more than a thousand years ago.</i>

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.880
<i>In other words,
that is your family's foe.</i>

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.920
<i>Moreover, I believe he's the one...</i>

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:53.470
<i>who might know how to turn
your sister back into a human.</i>

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.890
<i>That demon's name is...</i>

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.270
<i>...Muzan Kibutsuji!</i>

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.940
Eighth Form,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.190
Waterfall Basin!

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.070
<i>Too shallow!</i>

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.950
<i>I missed all the vulnerable spots!</i>

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.870
<i>Because I switched forms
midway through!</i>

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.460
<i>All three of them
have the exact same scent.</i>

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.010
<i>I was told that demons
don't band together as a rule.</i>

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.680
<i>So, one demon has dispersed
into three.</i>

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.850
<i>I'm going to protect these two
while slashing those three demons!</i>

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.480
<i>Don't lose your nerve!</i>

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.270
<i>Make sure you get him to tell you...</i>

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.610
<i>about Muzan Kibutsuji...</i>

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.360
<i>and how to turn a demon
back into a human!</i>

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.490 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.030
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.740
<i>Second Form...</i>

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.410
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.960
<i>Too shallow again!</i>

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.340
<i>I can't chase him too far.</i>

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.600
<i>And I can't take a full swing
while guarding others!</i>

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.270
You bastard!

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.190
Back off for crying out loud!

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.360
That girl's gonna go stale on me, dammit!

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.030
That girl's already 16, okay?

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.940
If I don't devour her soon,

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.030
she's gonna lose flavor
by the second!

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.660
Calm down, my other self.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.620
Hey, so what?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
There are gonna be nights like this.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.420
I've already fed on plenty
of 16-year-old girls in this town.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.800
They were all quite meaty and delicious.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.010
I'm satisfied.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.180
Well, I'm not satisfied, my other self!

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.930
I wanna consume more!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.940
You monster...

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.270
Return Satoko to me.
The one you abducted the night before last!

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.620
Satoko?

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.290
Who are you talking about?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.550 line:20%
If her hairpin
is among these collectibles,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.550
then I've devoured her.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.930
<i>I missed again!</i>

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.090
<i>He can escape underground so fast!</i>

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.850 line:20%
<i>Oh no! I got too close to the wall!</i>

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.490
Why would a mere human
be accompanying a demon?

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.830
<i>What's the meaning of this?
Who are those two?</i>

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.090
<i>Are they a swordsman
and demon working together?</i>

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.180
<i>I don't get it at all.</i>

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.310
Nezuko...

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.530
<i>This may only be cold comfort,</i>

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.280
<i>but while Nezuko was asleep,</i>

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.780 line:20%
<i>I used hypnotic suggestion on her.</i>

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.200
<i>Suggestion?</i>

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.290
<i>"All humans are your family."</i>

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.040 line:20%
<i>"Protect humans."</i>

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.540
<i>"The demons are the enemy"!</i>

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.070
Your kicks really saved the day, Nezuko!

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.320
Thanks!

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.990
It didn't break even after
all those kicks from the inside.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.990
That box is super-strong!

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.620
But isn't it cramped in there?
Isn't it uncomfortable?

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:22.250
I'll build a much bigger box for you!

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.840
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:33.300
I heard today's demon has been grinding
his teeth like crazy since he was a human.
