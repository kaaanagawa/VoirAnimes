<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.560
<i>Exploding Blood!</i>

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.240
The bond between Nezuko and me...

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.240
can't be...

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.240
severed by anyone!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.010
EPISODE 20:
PRETEND FAMILY

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.240 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.740
Nezuko!

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.410 line:20%
I-I won!

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.240 line:20%
I won!

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.250
My father saved me!

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.830
I'm not sure why I was able
to unleash that attack

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.460
with the kagura that's been
in our family for generations.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.670
But that was what saved me!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.590
I was able to beat him!

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.560
Huh?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.980
I can't see Nezuko!

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.310
Is it because I took
way too many breaths?

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.570
This ringing in my ears is brutal!

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.200
My whole body is throbbing with pain!

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.870
<i>I gotta...</i>

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.620
<i>heal up fast!</i>

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.080
<i>I'm still not done fighting!</i>

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.880
<i>I gotta go save Inosuke!</i>

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.670
<i>Right away!</i>

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.220 line:20%
<i>The scent of blood just got stronger!</i>

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.350
<i>Come to think of it,
it didn't give off the smell of ash.</i>

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.060
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.070 line:20%
Even though I chopped off his head?

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.280
You thought you'd defeated me?

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.900
Poor kid.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.200
Did your pathetic delusion
bring you joy?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.410
I cut off my head myself
with my own threads...

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.290
before you could chop it off.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.460 line:20%
Enough.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.130 line:20%
I'll kill both you and your sister.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.090 line:20%
I haven't been this enraged in a long time.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.220
<i>Get up!</i>

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.390
<i>Get up right now!</i>

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.220
<i>Get your breathing under control!</i>

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.310
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.930
<i>Right now!</i>

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.940 line:20%
But I wonder why you're not burning up.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.310
It was only me and my threads
that caught fire, right?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.860 position:80% line:50%
LOWER FIVE

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.320
I don't know if it's your sister's power,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.860
but thanks for getting me super-annoyed.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.490 line:20%
Now I can carve you up with no regrets.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.580
<i>If you use the correct breathing technique,</i>

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.080
<i>it makes no difference
how exhausted you are!</i>

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.580
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.000
<i>Murderous Eye Basket!</i>

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.340
<i>Don't panic!</i>

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.760
<i>Don't let it disrupt your breathing!</i>

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.300
<i>Calm down...</i>

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.760
<i>if you can calm down!</i>

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.310
<i>I can't raise...</i>

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.020
<i>my arm!</i>

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.610
<i>Somebody's here.</i>

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.620
<i>Is it Zenitsu?</i>

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.120
You did a good job holding out
until I got here.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.870 line:20%
Leave the rest to me.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.380
You're like an endless stream...

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.380
of lowlifes always getting in my way!

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.470
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.430
<i>Cutting Thread Rotation!</i>

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.060
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.650
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.980
<i>Eleventh Form...</i>

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.070
<i>Dead Calm.</i>

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.110
Eleventh Form?

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.950
Who cares about your Eleventh Form?

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.490
What?

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.460
<i>What's going on? What did he do?</i>

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.340
<i>The instant I got up in his face,</i>

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.250
<i>the threads scattered.</i>

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.590
<i>Not one of them reached him?</i>

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.840
<i>The toughest threads of all got slashed?</i>

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.930 line:20%
That's impossible!

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.310
One more time!

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.820
<i>I messed up!</i>

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.440
<i>I messed up!</i>

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.030
<i>And I was the only one
who never messed up until now</i>

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.910
<i>in this "Pretend Family" game!</i>

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.970
We finally drove her into a corner!

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.470
Hey, look at that.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.480
A demon?

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.940
It's just a kid.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.030
But even if it looks like a kid,
it's still a demon!

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.990
If we let it go, it'll devour humans!

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.360
Hey...

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.910
Hey...

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.780
You want me save you?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.370
In return,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.120
will you do what I ask?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.670 line:20%
I'll do anything!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.290 line:20%
I'll do whatever you want,
so please save me!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.710
Then, become a part of my family.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.720
I will! I'll do it!

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.550
What are they talking about?

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.140
All right, it's over for you!

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.630
Welcome.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.720
Starting today,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.100
you're part of my family, too.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.580
Drink this.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.670
Our family's power belongs to Rui.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.550
Since we were all weak demons,
Rui shared his power with us.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.470
Because Rui is one of that person's favorites,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.180
he gets special permission
to do this kind of thing.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:12.900
Do you feel it?

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.910
You don't have to fear
those demon hunters anymore.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.370
Now then,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.540
time for the finishing touches.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.720
All right, you can look up now.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.140
Congratulations.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.810
You're truly part of the family now.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.850
We're only playing house.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.680
What?

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.430
We have no blood ties.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.940
We're just a clan of assorted strangers.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.860
I'm so sorry!

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.190
I'll do better, Rui!

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.860
I'll practice! Forgive me!

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.950
I'm so sorry I couldn't do it well!

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.620
It's just that I revert
by accident sometimes!

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.170
I don't want to hear
your excuses, Mother.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.050
Play the role of mother like you should.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.640
I know what I must do, Rui.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.180
We were all so scared
of the demon hunters

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.480
and just wanted companions.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.820
It's not like we wanted to take part
in this baffling "Pretend Family" game.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.910
But those who fail to go along
with Rui's demands and orders

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.580
get carved up or have their
intellect taken from them

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.120
or get strung up,
exposed to the sunlight.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.410
I've had enough of this.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.920
I'm going to pretend
I never heard you say that—

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.250
I know you're not a fool.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.170
Unlike all the others.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.590
Let's run away together.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.350
I wouldn't say this to anyone but you.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:53.350
You're the one person
I truly think of as my younger sister.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.120
Tomorrow, Rui is going to be summoned
by that person and descend the mountain.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.830
That's our chance to escape.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.240
How disappointing.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:11.850
<i>They were all fools,</i>

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.520
<i>but I'm not like them!</i>

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.190
<i>Even so, I messed up!</i>

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.230
Rui!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.610
Rui!

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.690
Mother's been killed!

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.410
And our elder brother, too!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.950
What should we do?

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.660
The demon hunters aren't far behind.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.370
Listen...

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.330
Sh-Shouldn't we make a run for it?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.840
Don't...

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.220
You know, don't you?

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.470
I really hate it when your face reverts.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.640 line:20%
What are you looking at?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.100 line:20%
This isn't some show, you know.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.280
<i>I only got my face slashed,</i>

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.190
<i>so I got off easy!</i>

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.700
A demon!

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.080
What the...

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.790
It's futile.
You'll never cut through them.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.000
You see, my Ball of Yarn may feel soft,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.380
but it's extremely hard.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.500
Whaaa...

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.800
First, the solvent will melt
those clothes out of the way.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.340
And then, it'll be your turn.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.430
You'll be reduced to mush in no time,
and then I'll feed on you.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.810
How amazing!

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.810
Do you release those threads
from the palms of your hands?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.480 line:20%
Good evening.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.940 line:20%
The moon is quite lovely tonight,
don't you think?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.920
I can see you have no intention
of being my friend.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.670 line:20%
W-W-Wait!

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920 line:20%
I beg of you!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.590
I'm being forced to do this!

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.680
If I defy him,
I'll be slashed to shreds!

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.520
Is that right?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.440
That does sound tragic!

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:20.980
I'll spare you!

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.770
Let's be friends!

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.860
Y-You're going to spare me?

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.900
Yes!

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.200
But in order for us to be friends,

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.700
I must ask you a few questions.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.370 line:20%
Sweet young girl,

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.290 line:20%
how many people have you killed?

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:40.540
Five.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.130
But I was ordered to!
I had no choice!

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.130 line:20%
There's no need to lie about it.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:52.800 line:20%
Because I already know.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:58.720
That spell you cast to turn one of our men
into a cocoon was most impressive!

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.890 line:20%
Help me!

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.310 line:20%
Somebody!

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.310 line:20%
You've devoured at least
eighty humans, haven't you?

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.850 line:20%
No, of course
I haven't eaten that many.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.230 line:20%
I only killed those five.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.490 line:20%
But I came here
from the west, you know.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.740 line:20%
The west, my dear.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.740
On the west side of the mountain,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.330
I saw hordes of cocoons
hanging from the trees.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.080
The human captives inside
had been liquefied.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.750
All massacred.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.000
In that spot alone, I counted
at least fourteen cocoons.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.340
Fourteen humans.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.260
All dead.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.050
Oh, it's not that I'm angry.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:38.810
I'm only trying
to confirm the accurate toll.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.770
What good will it do you
to confirm that?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.690
You'll receive the penalty
you deserve and be reborn!

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.020
Penalty?

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.030
That way, you and I
can become friends.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.780
If you go unpunished
after having taken all those lives,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.370
your victims will never get justice.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.450
I could gouge out your eyeballs

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.460
or slash your stomach
to rip out your organs.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.500
For every person you've killed,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.550
I shall torture you.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.380
And after you've suffered
through all of the pain and agony,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.970
your sins will be forgiven.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.930 line:20%
Let's both give it our all!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.600
Don't worry! Since you're a demon,
my dear, surely it won't kill you

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.730
and neither will there be
any after effects!

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.060
Who do you think you're kidding?

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.900
Die!

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.230
You damn witch!

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.830
I can see that we'll never be friends.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.120
Oh, what a pity!

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.620
<i>Insect Breathing Butterfly Dance...</i>

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.080
<i>Caprice.</i>

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.500
<i>My head...</i>

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.380
<i>hasn't been cut off!</i>

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.880
<i>That's the sword she's using?</i>

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.300
<i>I see.</i>

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.970
<i>She's too tiny and has no arm strength,
so beheading is beyond her.</i>

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.270
<i>That's someone I can defeat!</i>

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:08.080
You mustn't think you're safe
just because you haven't been beheaded.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.130
Because there are swordswomen
like me who use poison.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.430
Demon Slayer Corps, Insect Hashira,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.050
Shinobu Kocho.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.140
I may be the only swordswoman among
the Hashiras unable to decapitate demons,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.400
but as I've created a poison
lethal to demons, I'm also rather awesome.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.150
Oh! Pardon me!

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.740
You're dead,
so you can't hear me, can you?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.070
Careless of me!

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.540
Are you all right?

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.120
Just barely!

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.170
What happened to the demon?

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.050
Shouldn't you finish it off?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.220
I killed her with wisteria poison.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.680
She's already dead,
so if we leave her, she'll rot.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.850
I'm a pharmaceuticals expert!

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.850
Your clothes did get dissolved,
but your body is more or less unscathed!

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.150
I'm so glad!

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.360
Now then,

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.870
as for the whereabouts of the demon
that forced this girl to do his bidding...

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.040
Did Tomioka beat me to it, then?

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:30.870
Nezuko...

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.160
Nezuko!

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.460
<i>I'll kill them! I'll kill them!</i>

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.920
<i>I'll kill those siblings no matter what!</i>

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.180 line:20%
Siblings!

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.760
<i>What is it that you want to do, Rui?</i>

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.270
<i>What do you mean by "family"?</i>

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.480
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.400
<i>Because I have no memories
of when I was human.</i>

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.740
<i>Is that why you made us
pretend to be your family?</i>

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.870
<i>I thought that if I could feel
a family bond,</i>

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.450
<i>my memories would come back.</i>

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.960
<i>The bond of a real family...</i>

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.500 line:20%
<i>That's right.</i>

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.920 line:20%
<i>I...</i>

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.010
Nezuko!

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.360
That's amazing! To think you made
a poison that can kill demons!

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.570
I am a student
of the pharmaceutical sciences.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.660
Being a Demon Slayer isn't just
about swinging a sword, you know.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.160
I-I see.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.740
And now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.120
I formulate my poison
inside my scabbard,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.130
and no one knows how it's done
but myself and my swordsmith!

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.340
All right, I'm gonna shoot up
the ranks with a special sword, too!

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.590
First, you need to acquire the skill
not to get your uniform melted off!

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.300
Such a toxic way of putting it!

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.220
Next, Episode 21,
"Against Corps Rules."

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:37.390
It's always good to have high ambitions!
Let's give it our all!
