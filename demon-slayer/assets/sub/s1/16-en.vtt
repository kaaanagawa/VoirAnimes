<i>Beast Breathing Seventh Form,</i>

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.230
<i>Spatial Awareness!</i>

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.170
Found it?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.040
Yeah! That way!

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm picking up a powerful vibe
from over there!

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.800
You are?

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.430
Way to go, Inosuke!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.350
We gotta take care of these guys
or we'll never get anywhere!

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.400
Damn. Isn't there...

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.820
Isn't there any way at all?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.000
EPISODE 16:
LETTING SOMEONE ELSE GO FIRST

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.520
Ne... Ne... Nezu... Ne...

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.270
Whe... Whe... Wh-Whe...
Whe... Where are you?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.030
Dammit!

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.530
What a pain in the ass!
I'm just gonna demolish them all at once!

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.870
You can't do that! Back off!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.000
There has to be a way!

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.170
So, let's try not to hurt these—

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.300
Murata?

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.220
Leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.260
What kind of talk is that,
Mr. Pissed-My-Pants?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.180 line:20%
I never pissed my pants,
you stupid boar!

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.350 line:20%
I wasn't talking to you,
so you can just shut up!

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.770
I know that wasn't
my finest moment back there,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.150
but I'm a Demon Slayer, too!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.070
I'll find a way to hold them off!

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.110
Now I know I just need to slash the threads,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.830
and that these guys can only make
the most elementary movements!

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.950
I'll watch out for the spiders, too!

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.420
There has to be people under
even more control closer to the demon!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.130
So, you two go on!

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.550
Understood! We appreciate this!

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.000
Let's go, Inosuke!

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.510
Hey, let go of me, dammit!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.720
I wanna pound that guy's face first!

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.470
Who's he calling "a stupid boar"?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.720
Would you shut up?
Just drop it and get out of here!

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.270
I'm so gonna punch you when I get back!

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.730
Dammit! I'm gonna punch that guy
if it's the last thing I do!

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.440
Stop talking like that!

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.240
He called me "a stupid boar," okay, Monjiro?

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.700
It's "Tanjiro"!

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.790
So, anyway, we're heading
the right way, right?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.450
My senses never lie!

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.710
But...

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.790
what the hell are these annoying threads?

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.590
That's how close
we're getting to the demon!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.430
Here's another bunch.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.180
No.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.350
Don't come any closer.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.570
Please summon someone of higher rank!

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.990
Otherwise, everyone will get killed!

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.030
Please.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.740
Please!

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.500
I wonder if you can defeat them.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.090
The closer you get to me,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.380
the thicker and stronger
these threads are,

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.050
and the more powerful
my dolls become.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.970
Mother...

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.060
You can win, right?

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.770
Rui...

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.190
Don't you think
this is taking too much time?

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.870
You'd better hurry up

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.410
or I'm gonna tell Father.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.580
I can do it! I can do it, all right?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.420
I promise to protect you!

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.500
So, please! Not your father!

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.970
Don't tell your father! Just not him!

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.060
Then, hurry it up.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.660
Die! Die! Just die already!

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.620
Or else there'll be hell for me to pay!

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.960
Run!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.710
<i>So fast!</i>

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.760
I'm being controlled,

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.050
so my movements
aren't my own at all!

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.810
I was never this strong!

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.200
<i>The demon's forcing her
to move her body with the threads,</i>

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.320
<i>so it doesn't care if her bones get broken!</i>

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:19.790
<i>So cruel!</i>

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.290
So stubborn!

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.960
How about this?

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.090
This sound!

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.350
P-Please kill me!

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.770
My arms and legs...

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.560
The bones are piercing my inner organs!

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.610
Every time I'm forced to move,

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.440
the pain's intense!

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.190
I can't take it anymore!

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.620
Either way, I'll die.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.330
So, please help me!

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.460
Please deliver the finishing blow!

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.790
Sure, you got it!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.290
Hold up—

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.420
Hold up, will you?
We gotta find a way to help him!

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.420
Oh, shut up!

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.430
You really need to shut up!

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.800
But...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.310
He's asking us to kill him, all right?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.860
These guys are speedy, too.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.480
If we get caught napping,
we're gonna go down!

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.440
I know that!

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.690
Let me think!
Just hold up a second!

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.780
<i>I don't want to use any attacks.</i>

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.950
<i>But even if we slash the threads,
they'll only get reattached!</i>

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.120
<i>To stop them from moving...</i>

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.700
<i>I know!</i>

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.210
Hey! Hey!

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.090
<i>Good! She's following me!</i>

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.760
Hey, why are you running around
in circles like that?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.300
Quit fooling around!

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.730
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.030
<i>Unbelievable strength!</i>

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.660
All right! You're all tangled up
like I planned!

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.000
Wha...

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.460
What's up with that?

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.920
I wanna do that, too!

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.430
Take this!

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.230
You see that?
I can do whatever you can do!

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.940
My bad! I kind of missed it!

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.240
What?

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.490
I mean, you can't really blame me!

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.500
Damn!

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.500
They're all such useless dolls!

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.250
I have no choice
but to unleash that doll, then.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:26.980
Nezuko!

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.820
Nezuko! Where are you?

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.150
Nezuko...

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.820
Tanjiro...

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.280
Wild Boar...

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.160
Chuntaro!

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.330
Where did you all go?

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.330
I'm sorry for everything, okay?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.590
Chuntaro?

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.890
You mean you came after me?
You're so adorable!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.310
Second only to Nezuko, but still!

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.320
I'm sorry for everything! All right,
let's go look for Nezuko together!

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.450
Just look at that!

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.200
Check it out!
I've tossed up more than you!

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.830
Right! One more to go!

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.450
Okay. I'm gonna do it one more time,
so make sure you watch!

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.410
You got it! That's okay!

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.210
Just try not to be violent!

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.300
I don't need those fragile human dolls
anymore! They're useless!

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.710
They're useless!

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.350
Dammit! Now they're all dead!

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.130
Let's go.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.210
Yeah, good idea.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.810 line:20%
This way! I'm gonna catch up to 'em soon!

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.970
<i>Now that the wind's changed direction,</i>

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.140
<i>my sense of smell
is starting to come back!</i>

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.060
<i>So, I'll be able to pinpoint
the demon's location!</i>

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.690
<i>There are two more scents!</i>

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.730
<i>There!</i>

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.690
Inosuke!

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.650
I detected that thing before you did!

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.320
I'm gonna hack its head right off!

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.500
That thing...

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.500
has no head!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.300 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.590 line:20%
Where are you?

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.940
Where the hell are you,
Tanjiro, Inosuke?

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.650
Don't just leave me here all by myself
in this terrifying forest!

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.450
What was that?

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.210
You know what?

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.250
This is starting to make me really mad!

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.210
I'll find Nezuko as soon as possible,
and then it's so long, scary forest!

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.260
Nezuko!

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.360
That thing's got no weak spots!
I can't slash something that's not there!

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.820
Inosuke!

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.740
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.410
Calm down! We'll inflict
a monk's robe cut on it!

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.490
Let's try slashing from the base of its neck
on the right side to his left waist!

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.910
It's a lot to cover, and I'm sure
it's really tough, but I bet...

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:19.670
Hold up! In unison...

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.960
It's fast!

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.260
But not so fast I can't dodge it!

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.600
Crap! I forgot about the spiders!

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.850
I can't move!

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:37.980
I'm a dead man!

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.370
Inosuke, let's fight together!
Let's think together!

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.500
Let's work together
so we can bring down this demon!

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:02.080
Damn you!

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.880
Don't make me any giddier
than I already am!

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.380
You're in my way!

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.140
Inosuke, launch yourself off me!

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.780
Inosuke, jump!

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:35.700 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.490 line:20%
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.080
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.750
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.930
Now for the monk's robe cut!

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.180
<i>Dammit, what the hell? This is annoying!
It's all going his way, huh?</i>

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.680
<i>It's like this was preordained
or something!</i>

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.480
<i>Flowing as naturally
as the water from a river...</i>

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.490
<i>It's not about going first
for this guy. It's the battle!</i>

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.740
<i>It's the overall flow that he's watching!</i>

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.760
<i>Great! He cut it just right!</i>

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.680
All right! You defeated it, Inosuke!

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980
Inosuke?

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.320
Anything you can do,
I can do, too, dumbass!

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.050
This scent...

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.420
So, that's what this is about,
huh, Inosuke?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.430 line:20%
<i>They got me! They got me!</i>

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.430 line:20%
<i>Even though that doll
was my fastest and strongest!</i>

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.640
<i>It's Rui's fault for coming to me
with his threats!</i>

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.980
<i>That's why I panicked!
I panicked! Panicked!</i>

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.860
From above?

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.530
<i>Water Breathing, First Form!</i>

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.450
<i>He'll kill me! He'll chop off my head!</i>

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.290
<i>Think! You have to think!</i>

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.120
<i>But...</i>

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.250
<i>if I die, I'll be released.</i>

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.010 line:20%
<i>And then, I'll know peace.</i>

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.640
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.430
<i>Blessed Rain After the Drought!</i>

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.360
<i>This is...</i>

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.620
<i>It feels like I'm being showered
by a gentle rain.</i>

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.910
<i>It doesn't hurt at all.</i>

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.960
<i>It's not agonizing.</i>

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.420
<i>I just feel warm.</i>

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.680
<i>I never dreamed that my end
would be this tranquil.</i>

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.640
<i>And now,</i>

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.810
<i>I'll be released.</i>

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.160
<i>I'm so sorry! I apologize,
so please forgive me!</i>

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.870
<i>What made you angry?
What caused you such displeasure?</i>

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.000
<i>It's your own fault
for not realizing what made him mad.</i>

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.090
<i>But how could I?</i>

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.470
<i>Mom's in trouble with Dad again!</i>

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.400 line:20%
<i>Stop it! No! No!</i>

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.410
<i>Those eyes...</i>

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.290
<i>Such kind eyes...</i>

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.220
<i>Back when I was human,</i>

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.430
<i>I think someone used to look at me
with kind eyes.</i>

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.560
<i>I wonder who that was.</i>

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.360
<i>I can't remember.</i>

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.030
<i>It was someone who always treasured me.</i>

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.500
<i>I wonder how that person is doing now.</i>

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.630
There's a member of the Twelve Kizuki here.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.220
Wait!

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.930
Be careful.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.110 line:20%
A member of the Twelve Kizuki is here...

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.320
A genuine member of the Twelve Kizuki...

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.280
here on this mountain!

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.050
Anything you can do,
I can do, too, you know!

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.050
Yeah, but I know what it is
that you can't do, Inosuke.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:50.930
What did you say?

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.930
After all this time,
you still can't get my name right.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.190
I do remember your damn name,
Kamaboko Gonpachiro!

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.060
Wrong.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.980
Shakariki Gengoro!

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.810
Wrong.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:02.940
Itadaki Tontaro!

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.320
Totally wrong!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.070
But now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.950
I hear that Inosuke can call someone by their
correct name about once every seven times.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.700
You've already mangled it three times.
Can you really get it right?

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.950
Anago Kanjiro!

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:18.160
Hey, you're getting warmer!

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.330
Hamado Tangoro!

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:20.120
So close!

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.290
Amado Jangoro!

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.500
You're 99 percent there!

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.290
Kamado...

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.340
Hey, who cares
what your name is anymore?

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.630
I was this close to hearing it.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.010
Next, Episode 17,
"You Must Master a Single Thing"!

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.310
You're you and I'm me.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.760
Got that, Tanjiro?

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.060
