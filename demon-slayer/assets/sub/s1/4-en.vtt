EPISODE 4:
FINAL SELECTION

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.260
<i>The reason I won...</i>

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.840
<i>was because I learned to detect
the scent of the opening thread.</i>

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.890
<i>When I'm battling someone,</i>

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.690
<i>and I pick up this scent,
then I can see the thread.</i>

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.030
<i>The thread is connected from my blade
to my opponent's opening,</i>

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.780
<i>growing taut the instant I see it.</i>

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.330
<i>My blade is drawn
toward it with great force,</i>

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.370
<i>and then I slash the opening.</i>

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.310
Mr. Urokodaki...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.740
I had no intention of sending you
to Final Selection.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.410
I didn't want to see
children die anymore.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.330
I was sure you wouldn't be able
to slice this boulder, but...

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.300
Well done, my boy!

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.050
Tanjiro, you're...

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.340
a remarkable kid!

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.650
Make sure you come back alive
from Final Selection.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.440
Both your sister and I
will be waiting for you here.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.000
What's the occasion? There's so much.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.250
You've completed all your training,
so we're celebrating.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.880
Don't be shy. Eat up.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.760
Thank you very much!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.260
<i>Tanjiro,</i>

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.600
<i>there's nothing more I can do for you.</i>

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.440
<i>From here on out, you'll be going
through such hardship and strife.</i>

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.280
<i>Your training will seem
like nothing in comparison.</i>

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.400
<i>So, for now, at least,</i>

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.530
<i>you should rest well
without a care in the world.</i>

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.090
Hey, Tanjiro...

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.800
Yes?

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.180
Did you enjoy that hot pot?

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.940
Yes! I haven't had such a feast in so long!

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.820
A growing boy like you with a hearty appetite
should get stronger the more he eats,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820
as well as grow bigger in size.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.900
But that goes for demons, too.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.990
Remember this.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.280
Basically, a demon is as strong
as the number of humans he's devoured.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.290
So, the more they eat,
the stronger they get?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.250
That's right.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.540
There are demons who gain power,
become able to transform their bodies,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.670
and even use strange spells.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.640
When your sense of smell
becomes keener,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.390
you'll be able to tell how many humans
a demon's consumed.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.650
What's this?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.190
It's called a "warding mask."

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.950
I've charged it with a spell
to protect you from harm.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.870
Warding mask...

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.860
Nezuko...

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.450
I'm coming back here
no matter what, all right?

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.750 line:20%
Don't worry about your sister.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.710 line:20%
I'll take good care of her.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.250
All right! Thank you very much!

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.630
I'll be going, then, Mr. Urokodaki!

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.640
Say hello to Sabito and Makomo for me!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.060
Tanjiro...

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.810
How do you...

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.610
know the names of those dead children?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.040
<i>Wow.</i>

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.330
<i>Look at all these wisteria flowers.</i>

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.330
<i>Even though they're out of season...</i>

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.160
<i>There are so many.</i>

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.160
- Everyone...
- Everyone...

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.120
- ...we thank you for coming here tonight.
- ...we thank you for coming here tonight.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.420
- To the Demon Slayers Corps Final Selection.
- To the Demon Slayers Corps Final Selection.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.050
There are demons imprisoned
here on Mt. Fujikasane,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.380
captured alive
by the Demon Slayer swordsmen,

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.680
and unable to leave.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:02.770
That is because wisteria,
which demons hate so much,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.440
blooms year-round from the bottom
to halfway up the mountain.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.940 line:20%
However, there is no wisteria
from this point on,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.820 line:20%
and so demons abound.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.580 line:20%
You'll need to survive here for seven days
to pass Final Selection.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.830
- And now, be on your way.
- And now, be on your way.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.180
<i>Survive for seven days...
That's all I'm going to think about.</i>

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.810
<i>First, I'm going to survive tonight.</i>

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.400
<i>Once the sun comes up,
the demons won't be able to do anything,</i>

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.490
<i>so I can get some rest then.</i>

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.990
<i>So, I'll have to head east!</i>

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.740
<i>I'm gonna make my way
to where the sunlight will hit first!</i>

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.210
<i>This smell... It's a demon!</i>

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.580
<i>And it's nearby!</i>

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.340
<i>Where is it?</i>

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.930
<i>Where's it coming from?</i>

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.430
<i>I can't pinpoint
the direction of the scent!</i>

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.180
From above?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.610
Demon...

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.910
Damn you!

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.080
Don't even try to grab my prey, man!

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.790
Get off my turf, dammit!

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.000
The hell with you! Just beat it!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.840
<i>Two of them right from the get-go?
I wonder if I can take them!</i>

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.550
That's my prey, you know!

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.550
Shut up!

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.090
It's first come, first served!

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.390
<i>I'm okay! Just calm down
and watch their movements!</i>

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.560
<i>Remember the training!</i>

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.020
It's been ages
since I last had human flesh!

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.480 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration!</i>

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.110 line:20%
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.740
<i>The scent of the thread!</i>

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.120
<i>Fourth Form!</i>

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.750
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.840
<i>I did it!</i>

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.100
<i>I defeated demons!</i>

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.100
<i>I've grown stronger!</i>

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.940
<i>All that training wasn't for nothing!</i>

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.190
<i>I've mastered it!</i>

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.280
<i>If I slash a demon with the sword
Mr. Urokodaki gave me,</i>

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.450
<i>not even the bones are left behind, huh?</i>

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.540
<i>A demon's weak spot is its neck!</i>

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.630
<i>But you can't kill it with a normal sword
even if you slash its neck.</i>

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.970
<i>Then, how can I take it down?</i>

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.300
<i>The swords wielded
by the Demon Slayer Corps</i>

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.800
<i>were forged with a special kind of steel.</i>

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.890
<i>That's the only way to kill a demon.</i>

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.890 line:20%
<i>They're called the "Nichirin Swords."</i>

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.780
<i>Rest in peace.</i>

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.240
What's this rotten smell?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.830
No one ever told me!
I never signed up for this!

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.920
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.770
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.780
Hey, Sabito...

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.070
Do you think Tanjiro can beat that one?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.240 line:20%
I don't know.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:36.210 line:20%
No matter how hard you try,
it's never enough.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.210
You know that well yourself, don't you?

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.890
What's this morphed demon
doing here anyway? They didn't tell us!

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.120
<i>He got eaten!</i>

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.020
<i>Don't wimp out!</i>

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.770
<i>Save him! Save him! Save him!</i>

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.110
<i>I'm not powerless anymore!</i>

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.270 line:20%
<i>Move!</i>

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.190
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form!</i>

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.610
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.460 line:20%
Another sweet little fox has come to me.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.040
"Another"?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.920
Little fox cub,
what is the year of Meiji now?

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.260
It's the Taisho Period now!

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.390
Taisho?

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.770
Holy crap!!

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.770 line:20%
Time has passed into a new period?!

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:30.280
Again! Again while I've been
held prisoner inside this place!

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.530
Unforgivable! Unforgivable!

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.040
Damn you, Urokodaki!
Damn you, Urokodaki!

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.460
Damn you, Urokodaki!
Damn you, Urokodaki!

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.460 line:20%
How do you know Mr. Urokodaki?

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.090
I know him, all right! Because Urokodaki
is the one who captured me!

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.050
I'll never forget that day 47 years ago!

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.640 line:20%
Back when he was still hunting demons!

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.550 line:20%
It was the Edo Period during the Keio Era.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.890
Hunting demons? Edo Period?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.230
You're lying!

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.940
No demon has ever lived that long!

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.070
The only demons in here should be the ones
who've eaten just two or three humans!

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.360
They don't live long because they're killed
during Final Selection,

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.070
and they even eat their own kind!

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.450
Yeah, but I've survived all this time.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:22.080
Inside this wisteria prison,
I've eaten at least fifty of you brats.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:23.750
Fifty?

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.250
11, 12...

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.630
13.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.010
That makes you Number 14!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.720
What are you talking about?

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.060
The number of Urokodaki's disciples
I've eaten, that's what.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.150
I promised myself to kill
every one of his disciples.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.490
Let's see... The ones who particularly
stand out to me... It's those two.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.070
Those two...

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.160
That brat's hair was an unusual color.
He was the most powerful.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.370
He had pinkish hair.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.500
A scar by his mouth.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.750
The other one was a female brat
in a flowery kimono.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
She was small and lacking in power,
but she was awfully agile.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.260
<i>They had already been killed
by this demon?!</i>

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.590
<i>But I was with them!</i>

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.010
That mask.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.100 line:20%
I can tell by the fox masks.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.690 line:20%
I know the texture of the masks
Urokodaki carved.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:31.110 line:20%
The same style of carving
he used for his own goblin mask.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.490
Warding masks, right?

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.360
Everyone got eaten just because
they were wearing them.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.780
They're all here inside my belly.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.870
Urokodaki might as well
have killed them himself!

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.670
When I said that to the girl,
she was crying and fell into a rage.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.420
And right after that,
she lost control of her movements.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.760
I ripped off her limbs, and then...

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.860 line:20%
Calm down, Tanjiro.
Your breathing's uneven.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.400 line:20%
It's all right. Never mind us!

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.710
<i>I'm getting out of here
while the demon's taking out that guy!</i>

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.760
Another of Urokodaki's brats is dying.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:50.440
I wonder how he's gonna feel
when another of his kids doesn't come home.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.940
I wonder what kind of look
he'll have on his face.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.190
Oh man, I wish I could see it.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.950
I really do.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.290
Big Bro!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.710
Big Bro!

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.580
<i>He dodged it!</i>

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.500
<i>So, he can still move?</i>

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.010
Great! I can have some fun!

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.720 line:20%
<i>Damn! No matter how many arms I cut,</i>

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:27.930 line:20%
<i>they grow back in a second!</i>

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.940
You can't defeat me
just by slashing off my arms.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.320
Then again, even that pink-haired brat
couldn't slice off my head!

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.080
<i>I can't just let this one go!</i>

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.170
<i>Before any more lives are sacrificed,</i>

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.550
<i>I gotta bring him down now!</i>

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.840
<i>A demon's scent
coming from the ground?</i>

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.770
<i>H-He jumped! Dammit, I missed him!</i>

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.900
<i>Yeah, but no way can he dodge
this attack in mid-air!</i>

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.450
Do you think Tanjiro's going to lose, too?

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.950
His neck is so tough after all.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.410
He may lose, and yet, he may win.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.080
Either way, there's one irrefutable fact.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.550 line:20%
That Tanjiro...

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.550
is the man who sliced
the toughest, largest boulder of all.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.140
<i>He deflected me!</i>

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.440 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration!</i>

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.310
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.440
<i>He got too close to me!</i>

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:07.370
<i>Not to worry. My neck is tough!
He can't slash it!</i>

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.780
<i>First Form!</i>

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.540
<i>As soon as he fails to cut my neck,
I'm going to crush his head!</i>

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.620
<i>Just like I did to the other one!</i>

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.470
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:24.170 position:20% line:20%
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:04.360
Water Surface Slash!

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.190
How was that Nezuko?
How cool am I?

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.030
What? Sabito was cooler than me?

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.030
C-Come on, Nezuko!

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.500
R-Right!

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.130
I saw beautiful wisteria flowers
blooming around the exam hall.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.290
Let's go see them
when you turn back into a human.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.170
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.840
A blond boy named Zenitsu...
I heard he was brought here

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.930
after he got slapped by his master
for refusing to take the selection exam.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.850
Next, Episode 5, "My Own Steel"!

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.980
