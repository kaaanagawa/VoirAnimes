00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.980
Come on out, demon!

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.480 line:20%
Stop it!

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.860
Look, it's the human blood
you love so much!

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.870 position:20%

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.010
EPISODE 23:
HASHIRA MEETING

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.440
What's the matter, demon? Come on!

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.190
You know you want it.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.370
Iguro, you're digging into him too hard.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.450
Ease up a bit please.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.170 line:20%
I'm only holding him down
because he's trying to move.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.590
Kamado,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.470
if you use any breathing techniques
while your lungs are being squeezed,

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.260
your veins will burst.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.640
His veins will burst!

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.180
I like it! Sounds flamboyant!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
Come on! Start bursting!

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.350
Poor soul...

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.650
Such a weak, pathetic child.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.650 line:20%
Namu Amida Butsu.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.420
Kamado?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.220 position:80% line:20%
DESTROY

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.800
Nezuko!

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.940
She's my sister!

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.900
She's my younger sister!

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.820 line:20%
Nezuko is different!

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.910 line:20%
Though I don't know how it happened!

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.600
<i>All humans are your family.</i>

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.730
<i>Protect humans.</i>

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.210
<i>Humans are to be protected and saved.</i>

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.750
<i>Never hurt them.</i>

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.090
<i>I will never hurt them.</i>

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.240
What just happened?

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.780
The demon girl turned her back in disgust.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.830
Although she'd been stabbed
three times by Shinazugawa,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.660
and despite his flaunting
of his bloody arm in her face,

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.370
she restrained herself and did not bite.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.510
So now, it's been proven
that Nezuko won't attack humans, right?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.600
What do you think you're doing, Tomioka?

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.890
Tanjiro...

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.520
I'm sure that even after this,
there are some who can't accept Nezuko.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.530
You must prove it to them starting now.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.070
That you and Nezuko can fight
as Demon Slayers.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.370
That you can be useful.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.160
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.290
<i>It's like I'm floating.</i>

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.170 line:20%
<i>His voice...</i>

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.970 line:20%
<i>Is it because of this man's voice
that I'm feeling light in the head?</i>

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.840
Go out and defeat a Twelve Kizuki.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.680
Do that, and you'll be accepted by all.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.230
And it will give more weight to your words.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.310
I...

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.740
Nezuko and I will defeat Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.280
Nezuko and I will do it for sure!

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.620
Strike with the sword
that will stop the chain of grief!

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.410
As you're ill-equipped to do so
right now, Tanjiro,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.370
let's start by defeating
a Twelve Kizuki, all right?

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.960
Yes, sir.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.760
<i>You mustn't laugh!
You mustn't, you mustn't, you mustn't!</i>

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.430
It goes without saying

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.850
that the Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps
have phenomenal skills.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.980
After training themselves to death,
they have defied death,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.940
and they've also defeated Twelve Kizuki.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.060
A good attitude to have!

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.110
That is why Hashira receive
respect and preferential treatment.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.070
So, Tanjiro, mind your manners
when you speak.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.450
Y-Yes, sir!

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.370
One more thing. Sanemi...

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.120
Obanai...

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.710
Don't torment the younger ones too much.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.750
As you wish.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.340
As you wish.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.260
Tanjiro, we have concluded
our business with you.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.510
You may step back.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.270
In that case, allow me
to take Kamado into my house.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.320
All right, then!
Take them away please!

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:57.910
Pardon me for cutting in front of you!

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:57.910 position:80% line:20%
KAKUSHI

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.130
Now then, let us begin the Hashira Meet—

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.470
Hold on a second!

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.470 line:20%
Come back here!

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.560
Please allow me to head-butt
that man covered in scars!

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.900
I gotta—

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.610
Shut up! Keep your mouth shut!

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.820
I gotta head-butt him as many times
as he stabbed Nezuko!

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.200
Head-butting isn't a violation
of the Corps rules, right?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.320
Shut up! Settle down now!

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.080
- Let go of me!
- Cut it out!

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.090
You're not allowed to interrupt the Master.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.760
- We beg your pardon!
- We beg your pardon, Master!

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.590
- Master Tokito!
- We beg your pardon!

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.220
We beg your pardon!

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.560
We assure you that this boy
will be severely reprimanded, so—

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.050 line:20%
<i>Muichiro!</i>

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.810 line:20%
<i>What a fine boy!</i>

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.600
So please! Please!

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.600 line:20%
<i>So cool!</i>

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.520
Just get out of our sight.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.980
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:09.570
Tanjiro...

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.990 line:20%
Give Miss Tamayo my regards.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.450
Hold up a second!

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.870
I just heard him
mention Miss Tamayo's name!

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.870
Don't you say another word!

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.290
- We got yelled at because of you!
- I thought I'd pee my pants!

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.920
You don't know
how terrifying the Hashira are!

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.510
Try to read the room! Read it!

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.130
- I'll never forgive you as long as I live!
- I'll never forgive you!

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.390
- Apologize!
- Apologize! Apologize!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.510
I...

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.180
I'm sorry.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:48.100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.110
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.440
Hello! Is anyone home?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.490
Hello! Is anyone home?

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.990
Hello...

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.370
Jeez, no one's coming to the door.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.370
Let's go check out the yard.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.500
Hey, walk on your own.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.670
I'm sorry.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.800
It's just that my whole body
is aching like crazy.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.560 line:20%
The headquarters was huge, too,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.980 line:20%
but this mansion's something else, huh?

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.900
<i>Come to think of it, was this place
called the "Butterfly Mansion"?</i>

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.660
Hey, there's someone.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.910
Someone's here.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.660
That would be, um...

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.330
Oh, right! The Tsuguko...

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.630
Her name is...

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.000
Tsuguko?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.300
It's Master Kanao Tsuyuri.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.180
It's the girl from Final Selection.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.230
Hey, somebody's forgotten how they got
stomped on by Master Kanao last night.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.530
A Tsuguko is a swordsman
trained by a Hashira.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.030
Only the ones with mind-blowing
skills and talent get chosen.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.780
She's a girl, but she's awesome!

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.500
Please forgive us, Master Tsuyuri.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.460
We were ordered to come here
by Master Kocho.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.130
Permission to enter the mansion?

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.390
Uh, do you mind?

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.270
You don't mind, do you?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.060
And who are you?

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.110
- Uh...
- We were ordered by Master Kocho!

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.530
Are you a Kakushi?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.320
You've brought an injured person, right?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.320
Please come this way.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.320
Uh, right!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.950
She's fast!

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.710
Five times?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.210 line:20%
I gotta take this five times? A day?

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.050
And I have to keep taking
this medicine for three months?

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.550
If I take this, I can't eat
anything, you know!

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.600
I mean it's really bitter!
It's such an ordeal!

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.600
So, you mean my arms and legs will heal
just by taking medicine? For real?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.480
Listen, are they really gonna heal?
Tell me how they're gonna get healed!

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.850 line:20%
Please stop shouting, will you?

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.320
Somebody explain this to me better!

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.070 line:20%
So, that guy is still making
a commotion.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.530
What's gonna happen if I forget
to take it even once? Hey!

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.110
Listen! My arms and legs!
What's gonna happen to my arms and legs? Hey!

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.490 line:20%
What's gonna happen if I forget
to take it? Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.740
Zenitsu!

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.240 position:20% line:50%
MEDICINE
For Zenitsu Agatsuma
Take 5 times daily
7 days' worth
After each meal

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.080
Please try to be quiet!

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.750
Didn't we already explain it
to you numerous times?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.670
If you don't stop this nonsense now,
we'll tie you up!

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.550
Really now!

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.010
Zenitsu!

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.890 line:20%
Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.390 line:20%
So you did come up the mountain after all!

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.270
T-Tanjiro...

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.810
Tanjiro! Listen to me, will you?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.900
I got stung by this stinky spider,
and the poison hurt like crazy, okay?

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:30.450
And that girl's been yelling at me
all this time! I hate my life!

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.870 line:20%
Hey, get away from me.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.740 line:20%
I've got nothing to do with this.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.250 line:20%
Zenitsu, did you get smaller or something?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.300
I almost got turned into a spider.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.510
My arms and legs
are really short right now.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.010
Is that right?

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.680 line:20%
Where's Inosuke?

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.640 line:20%
Have you seen Murata?

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.560 line:20%
I don't know about anyone named Murata,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.140
but Inosuke's right next to me.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.980
Hey, you're right!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.820
He's been here all this time!
And I didn't notice!

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.740
Inosuke, I'm so glad you're all right!

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.830
I'm so glad you're all right!

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.410 line:20%
I'm so sorry! I couldn't rescue you!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.210
It's okay.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.670
Don't worry about it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.710
Paper! Paper!
Do something about this!

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.170 line:20%
Your voice...

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.090 line:20%
Is that you, Inosuke?

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.260
Wipe it! Hey! Do you hear me? Hey!

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.100 line:20%
I heard he lost his voice or something.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.100
I don't have all the details,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.310
but I heard he, like, got hit in the neck,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.440
and when he yelled at the top of his lungs
at the end, that finished it off.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.110
And it did a number on his throat.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.450
He's depressed now, so it's made him
gentle, and it really cracks me up!

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.370
Why are you cackling
in that creepy way all of a sudden?

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.370
What's going on?

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.840
I'm sorry for being so weak.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.510
Hang in there, Inosuke!

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.760
It's not like you to get depressed!

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.970
Come on, you did good!
You're awesome!

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.930
I'm just so happy that you're alive!

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.520
Did I take my morning meds?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.770
Did you see me take them?
Somebody? Did you see?

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.650
Somebody? Did you see?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.580
Zenitsu...

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.120
Inosuke...

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.750
Thank goodness.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.670
You're alive.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.740
It's all right now.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.490
They said you could use
this room, Nezuko.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.040 line:20%
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.250 line:20%
I really got roughed up
on Mt. Natagumo.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.920 line:20%
It hurts a lot.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.300 line:20%
To be honest, it hurts like crazy.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.590
Nezuko...

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.060
Thanks for protecting me
on the mountain.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.020
Who would've guessed that not only you,

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.190
but Mr. Urokodaki
and Mr. Tomioka, as well...

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:50.320
They're all risking their lives for us.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.570
They're all taking care of us.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.120
I need to...

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.200
become stronger.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.370
Even today...

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:09.250
The Master more or less
saved both your life and mine.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.130
That man's voice...

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.180
It was so soothing in a mysterious way.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:21.810
Just listening to him speak
made my head feel light.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.640 line:20%
I wonder what kind of person he is.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.660
Oh, right.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.950
You're sleep-deprived, aren't you?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.540 line:20%
I'm hurting, and this is tough,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.000 line:20%
but I gotta keep on fighting.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.340 line:20%
Because...

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.340 line:20%
I'll be a grown man one day.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:54.670 line:20%
And then,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.640 line:20%
I'll become an old guy and die.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.220 line:20%
And then,

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.350 line:20%
the demon Nezuko will end up all alone.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.150
That would be too lonely,
wouldn't it, Nezuko?

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:16.360
I promise you I'll turn you
back into a human, okay?

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.700
Just as you've all reported,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.330
the demons' carnage
has increased more than ever.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.340
Meaning that the threat to human life
is greater than it's ever been.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.800
We'll have to bolster the ranks
of the Demon Slayers.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.800
What do you all think?

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.100
The incident on Mt. Natagumo
made it crystal clear.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.020
The caliber of Demon Slayers
has nose-dived to unbelievable levels.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.940
Most of them are useless.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.860
The trainers must be blind.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.610
You'd think they could at least tell
if someone's competent or not.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.030
Well, that kid today
sure seemed competent.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.790
He did land that flamboyant blow on you,
Shinazugawa. He's got potential.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.080
The more the human population increases,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.300
the harder it becomes
to control and unify them.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.050
Not to mention that the times
have changed considerably in this era.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.760
Other than those who've had their loved ones
brutally massacred, and joined the Corps,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.730
or those of distinguished pedigree
who have hunted demons for generations,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.350
to ask anyone to harness as much

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:36.030
or even greater resolve and drive
to produce results would be cruel.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.950
Still, considering that boy ran into a Twelve Kizuki
so soon after joining the Corps...

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.030
He may have the power to draw them!

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.950
Even we rarely get the chance
to confront one! It makes me envious!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.460
Agreed.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:57.590
But the fact that Lower Five
made such a drastic move

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.180
probably means that Muzan
is nowhere near Mt. Natagumo.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.090
After all, as in the case of Asakusa,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.760
whenever Muzan wishes
to hide something,

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.230
he creates a clever diversion
to throw us off.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.650
It's really quite frustrating.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:24.490
But those demons are still freely devouring
humans, gaining strength and surviving.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.250
For the sake of those who have died,
there is only one thing for us to do.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:35.630
I believe that among you Hashira
who are present today,

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:41.420
I've assembled the finest unit since
the First Breathing swordsmen of the feudal era.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.930
Tengen Uzui.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.430
Kyojuro Rengoku.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.560
Shinobu Kocho.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.680
Mitsuri Kanroji.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.190
Muichiro Tokito.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.560
Gyomei Himejima.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.940
Sanemi Shinazugawa.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.070
Obanai Iguro.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.150
Giyu Tomioka.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.660 line:20%
My children,

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.870 line:20%
I look forward to your success.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.880
Muzan Kibutsuji,

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.180
I swear I'll defeat you
if it's the last thing that I do.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.890 line:20%
We will bring you down without fail.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:17.290 position:80% line:50%
PREVIEW

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.440
I still find it hard to believe
that some demons don't attack humans.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.150
It must be a miracle or something.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:11.740
If you're gonna go there, then,
us trying to find a clue about Kibutsuji is...

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.990
well, what you call a "millennial miracle"!

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.290
That's a typical and flamboyant
idea if I ever heard one!

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.920
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.710
I hear that the Master is the 97th leader
of the Demon Slayer Corps!

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.800
To make sure we don't squander
this opportunity,

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.220
we Hashira need to be the glue that holds
the Demon Slayer Corps together!

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.220
Are you mentally prepared
for that, Sound Hashira?

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:33.300
You don't have to remind me,
Flame Hashira!

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.930
Next, Episode 24,
"Rehabilitation Training"!

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.060
