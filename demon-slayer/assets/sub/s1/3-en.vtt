JOURNAL
Tanjiro Kamado

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.340
Let's go.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:11.270 position:20% line:50%
DESTROY

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.940
The Demon Slayer Corps has
around several hundred members.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.360
It's an organization
unrecognized by the government.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.490
Yet it's existed since ancient times,
and we continue to hunt demons today.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.990
But as for who's leading
the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.500
that remains a mystery.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.500
Demons.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.130
Staple food... Humans!

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.840
They kill humans and feed on them.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.300
No one knows when and where
they first appeared.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.470
Their physical prowess is remarkable.
Wounds heal in the blink of an eye.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.140
Flesh is restored after being hacked off,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.440
and limbs can be newly regenerated.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.690
Some demons can shape-shift.
Others have otherworldly powers.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.280
They can only be killed by sunlight
or by decapitation with a special sword.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.910
The Demon Slayers battle the demons
with their own mortal bodies.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.580
Since they're human,
their wounds are slow to heal,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.710
and, once lost,
their limbs don't grow back!

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.540
Even so, they battle the demons...

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.460
to protect other humans.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.550
EPISODE 3:
SABITO AND MAKOMO

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.100
I am a trainer.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.480
I literally train swordsmen.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.820
There are many trainers,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.110
and each of them trains their pupils
with their own regimen in their location.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.530
To join the Demon Slayer Corps,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.670
you must survive the Final Selection
process held on Mt. Fujikasane.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.130
Whether or not you're eligible
for Final Selection is up to me.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.880
<i>Starting today, I'm going to keep
a journal for Nezuko.</i>

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.760
<i>I'm descending the mountain again today.</i>

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.970
<i>I'm going to train my hardest
so I won't die during Final Selection.</i>

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.940
<i>After repeatedly descending
the mountain, day after day,</i>

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.190
<i>I'm starting to learn
how to avoid most of the traps.</i>

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.030
<i>It's because I'm much stronger now,</i>

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.370
<i>and because I'm even more adept
at detecting scents than before.</i>

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.950
<i>Even so...</i>

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.790
<i>the traps are getting
more and more difficult.</i>

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.420
<i>He may really want to kill me!</i>

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.600
<i>I made my descent today,
sword in hand,</i>

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.980
<i>but the sword really hampered
my movement.</i>

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.440
<i>With the sword,</i>

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.650
<i>I can't stop getting ensnared
in all the traps!</i>

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.820
991!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.200
<i>I swing the sword today.</i>

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.080
<i>Well, it's not just today. I've been swinging
the sword every single day.</i>

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.960
<i>After descending the mountain,
I swing my sword until my arms nearly fall off.</i>

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.080
1,000!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.800
500 more!

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.310
Swords break easily.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.900
<i>That's what he told me beforehand.</i>

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.740
<i>Though it's strong vertically,
it's weak horizontally, so...</i>

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.830
<i>you need to apply the force
straight along the blade.</i>

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.790
<i>The blade's direction and the direction
in which you apply the force</i>

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.170
<i>must be exactly the same.</i>

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.920
<i>And he added, "If you ever damage
the blade, in other words, break it,</i>

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.640
<i>I'll snap your bones, as well"
in a threatening tone of voice.</i>

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.390
Nezuko...

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.890
I'll keep working hard, okay?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.080
<i>Today, I did nothing but fall.</i>

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.920
<i>Training to break my fall
and get up quickly from any position.</i>

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.090
<i>I wield my sword,</i>

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.340
<i>and I charge Mr. Urokodaki
really trying to kill him.</i>

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.590
<i>In contrast,</i>

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.760
<i>Mr. Urokodaki is bare-handed
and unarmed.</i>

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.680
<i>But he's ridiculously powerful!</i>

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.350
<i>He flings me away
to roll on the ground every time.</i>

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.110
I'm home, Nezuko.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.120
<i>Today, I learned breathing
techniques and some forms.</i>

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.380
Total Concentration Breathing?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.000 line:20%
That's right.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.880 line:20%
And I'm going to teach you
all ten of the Water Breathing forms.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.970
Remember to take a long breath
so the oxygen flows into every cell in your body.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.690
This will enhance
your body's natural healing power,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.810
and both stabilize
and energize your spirit.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.400
Relax your upper body

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.650
while bracing your lower half.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.410
All right, breathe!

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.000
Wrong!

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.670
Next! Forms!

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.090
Right! Like this?

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.250
Wrong!

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.300
Like this?

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.260
Wrong!

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.960
This?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.760
Wrong!

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.510
This?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.340
Wrong!

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.640
<i>I get yelled at
for not bracing my stomach</i>

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.600
<i>and clobbered to a pulp.</i>

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.600
<i>Next, he told me
to become one with the water.</i>

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.770
Get in there!

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.530
Nezuko!

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:44.250
Nezuko! I am water!

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:51.090 line:20%
<i>And now it's been six months
since Nezuko was last awake.</i>

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.470
<i>Mr. Urokodaki summoned the doctor
right away and had him examine her,</i>

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.390
<i>but he found nothing wrong.</i>

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.850
<i>But it's not normal for her
to stay asleep like this.</i>

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.110
<i>I was scared.</i>

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.400
<i>I worry that one morning,</i>

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.940
<i>I'll wake up to find her dead.</i>

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.620
<i>Not a day goes by that I don't worry.</i>

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.040
<i>My descents are getting more dangerous,</i>

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.050
<i>and the air's even thinner where I train.</i>

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.930
<i>Time and time again,
I think I might die.</i>

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.660
I have nothing more to teach you.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.040
<i>A year after I arrived at Mt. Sagiri,</i>

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.160
<i>he told me all of a sudden...</i>

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.790
The rest is up to you!

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.920
Whether or not you can improve
to the next level.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:20.430
Come with me!

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.070
If you can slice this boulder,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.450
I will allow you to enter Final Selection.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.460 line:20%
<i>Is a boulder...</i>

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.920
<i>something you slice?</i>

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.460
<i>Something you can slice with a sword?</i>

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.970
<i>I don't think I can do it.</i>

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.470
<i>My sword will snap!</i>

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.350
Mr. Urokodaki, please wait!

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.230
Mr. Urokodaki!

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:17.320
<i>After that, Mr. Urokodaki
never taught me anything again.</i>

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.390
<i>Every day,</i>

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.220
<i>I practiced over and over
what I'd learned from Mr. Urokodaki.</i>

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360
<i>The basics like holding the breath
and flexibility...</i>

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.860
<i>I was glad I had written those
down in my journal.</i>

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120 line:20%
<i>But...</i>

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.130 line:20%
<i>even after six months had passed,
I still couldn't slice the boulder.</i>

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.250
<i>I felt frustrated.</i>

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.340
<i>Not enough!</i>

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.420
<i>I wasn't training hard enough!</i>

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.260
<i>I gotta do more!</i>

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.720
<i>More!</i>

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.810
<i>Am I...</i>

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.690
<i>hopeless?</i>

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.820
<i>Is Nezuko going to die
without ever waking up?</i>

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.740
<i>I'll almost give in! I'm breaking down!!</i>

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.320 line:20%
Keep working, Tanjiro! You can do it!!

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:49.790
Shut up!

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.630
A man shouldn't whine.
It's unseemly.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.380
<i>When did he show up?</i>

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.470
<i>There's no scent. A fox mask?</i>

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.720
Now matter how you suffer,
bear it in silence...

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.470
if you're a man.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.810
If you call yourself a man.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.320
Slow.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.700
Weak.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.160
Immature.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:30.160
That's not what you call a man.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.920
What are you doing?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.430
I'd like to know
what you think you're doing.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.970
What do you mean?

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.470
I'm training.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.680
How long do you plan
to keep your butt on the ground

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.430
without even taking a stance?

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.940
Come on. Come at me.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.490
But you have a wooden sword,
and I have a real sword!

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:26.300
Well, well! Thank you
for worrying about me.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.930
So, you think
you're actually going to injure me!

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.640
Well, you have
absolutely nothing to worry about!

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.810
I'm more powerful than you

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.190
because I've sliced that boulder!

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.190
<i>He's sliced that boulder?</i>

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.880
You've learned nothing.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.460
You haven't mastered a single thing!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.920 line:20%
Particularly, the breathing technique
Mr. Urokodaki taught you...

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.470 line:20%
Total Concentration Breathing.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.350 line:20%
<i>He knows Mr. Urokodaki?</i>

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.640 line:20%
<i>And the breathing technique, too?</i>

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.520
All you did was memorize it as fact.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.650
Your body has no clue
what it needs to do.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.650
What the hell were you doing
for a whole year and a half?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.740
Slam it into your flesh!

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.450
More!

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:36.790
More!

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.790
More!

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.210
So that you'll never forget the secrets
Mr. Urokodaki taught you!

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.130 line:20%
Pound it into the marrow of your bones!

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.880
I'm trying!

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.550
I'm trying every single day!

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800
With everything I've got!

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.890
But I'm not making any headway!

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.430
I just can't go any further!

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.850 line:20%
Go further!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.060 line:20%
If you're a man!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.190
If you call yourself a man!

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.690
There's no other way
to go but forward!

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.150
Bring it on!

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.030
Show me what you're capable of!

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.380
I'm leaving the rest to you.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.770
Are you all right?

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.230
Did you see that just now?

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.820
What a strike that was!

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.240
Not a single bit of wasted motion!

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.450
It was really beautiful!

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:59.160
I want to become like that!
You think I can become like him?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.910
I'm sure you can...

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.330
since I'll be looking after you.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:11.840
<i>She's so cute.</i>

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.720
Who are you?

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.810
<i>This girl's name was Makomo.</i>

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.770
<i>She told me the boy's name was Sabito.</i>

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:28.360
<i>Makomo also pointed out my defects.</i>

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.740
<i>She corrected my unnecessary
movements and bad habits.</i>

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.860
<i>But when I asked her
why she was doing that,</i>

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.660
<i>and where she came from,
she didn't tell me anything.</i>

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.290
Both he and I love
Mr. Urokodaki very much.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.420
<i>That was Makomo's pet phrase.</i>

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.800 line:20%
<i>She and Sabito weren't siblings.</i>

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.590 line:20%
<i>She said Mr. Urokodaki raised them
after they'd been orphaned.</i>

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.720 line:20%
There are other children besides us.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.470 line:20%
They're always watching you, Tanjiro.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.270 line:20%
<i>Makomo is a somewhat strange girl.</i>

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.320 line:20%
<i>She speaks in such an abstract,
dreamy way.</i>

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.860
See, Total Concentration Breathing
accelerates your blood circulation

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.780
and your heart rate.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.200
That causes
your body temperature to spike,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.750
making you as strong as a demon
while staying human.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.920
The important thing
is to expand your lung capacity.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:35.090
When you bring lots of air into your blood,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:37.300
and when your blood gets excited,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.050
your bones and muscles scurry
to heat up and grow stronger.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.640
<i>I'm not sure I get that.</i>

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.600
How can I do that?

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.820
Train to death.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.030
At the end of the day,
there's nothing else you can do.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.530
<i>Until my arms and legs
were ready to fall off...</i>

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.790
<i>Until my lungs and heart
were ready to burst,</i>

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.960
<i>I swung my sword.</i>

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.790
<i>But still...</i>

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.130
<i>I just couldn't beat Sabito.</i>

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.630
<i>Not until six months later.</i>

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.730
<i>When I challenged him that day,</i>

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.150
<i>Sabito was wielding a real sword.</i>

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.650
After six months, finally,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.070 line:20%
you have the look of a man.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.040
Today's the day I win!

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.960
<i>Head-on battles are simple.</i>

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.970
<i>Whoever's stronger and faster wins.</i>

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.980
<i>The battle was over in an instant.</i>

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.360
<i>On this day, in this moment,
for the first time,</i>

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.870
<i>my blade reached Sabito first.</i>

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.250
<i>The moment I won,</i>

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.510
<i>Sabito smiled.</i>

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.300
<i>He looked sad and happy.</i>

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.140
<i>A relieved kind of smile.</i>

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.060
Tanjiro...

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.020
You did great.
Don't forget what you just did.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.190
Win, okay, Tanjiro?

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.030
Beat that guy, too.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:08.950
<i>The next thing I knew,</i>

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.950
<i>Sabito was gone.</i>

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.750
<i>And my sword, which I was sure
had slashed Sabito's mask...</i>

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.470
<i>...had sliced the boulder.</i>

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.570
Yeah, I was shocked, too!

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:08.570
I could never imagine
I'd be able to cut a boulder like that.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.910
I couldn't have done it
without Sabito and Makomo.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.660
I can't thank them enough.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.120
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.120
Why does Mr. Urokodaki wear a mask?

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.800
I heard that's because demons used to make fun
of his face for looking too kind.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.970
Sabito, Makomo and Mr. Urokodaki!

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.100
I'll work harder
to turn Nezuko back into a human!

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.060
Next, Episode 4, "Final Selection"!
