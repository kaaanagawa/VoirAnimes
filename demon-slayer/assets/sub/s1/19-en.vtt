00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.240
<i>No way!</i>

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.700
<i>My sword!</i>

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.010
EPISODE 19:
HINOKAMI

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780
<i>Amazing!</i>

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
<i>He's on a different level! The force
of his stroke is in a different class!</i>

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.780
<i>He's head and shoulders above the rest!</i>

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.540
<i>He slashed that
tough-as-nails monster like tofu!</i>

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.040
<i>Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!</i>

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.210
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.210
<i>I still have goosebumps, dammit!</i>

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.720
Hold up a second!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.140
Fight me, Mismatched Haori!

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.770
You beat that Twelve Kizuki!

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.860
And I'm gonna beat you!
That's how I've drawn it up!

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.480
If I can do that...

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.410
that'll make me the most powerful of all!

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.580
Go back to training, idiot.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.000
What the...

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.870
That was no Twelve Kizuki
or anything close to one.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.080
You can't even tell that much?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.290
Sure I can tell!

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.050
I never thought that scrub could be
one of the Twelve Kizuki, either!

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.130
It was Tanjiro who said
it was one of the Twelve Kizuki!

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.800
All I did was repeat what he said, all right?

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.560
<i>What's going on? Did he just tie me up?</i>

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.020
<i>So quick!</i>

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.560
<i>This guy's so quick!</i>

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.070
Wait, you! Come back here!

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.950
Stay out of battle if you don't
even realize how hurt you are.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.330
I can't hear you! Your voice
is too soft, and you walk too fast!

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.120
I said hold up a second!

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.870
Untie these ropes right now!

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.620
Hey! Hey!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.630
Hey!

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.140
Yoo-hoo!

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.230
Are you all right?

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.820
Gramps...

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.240
Who are you calling "Gramps"?

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.740 line:20%
Just now, Gramps showed up,

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.740 line:20%
and told me not to give up.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.620 line:20%
You saw your life flashing before your eyes.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.330 line:20%
According to one theory, the reason
one sees such images just before death

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.170 line:20%
is because you're searching
for a way to avoid death

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.180 line:20%
by going through all your
past experiences and memories.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.930
Well, not that I can say for sure,
since I've never experienced it myself.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.350
Right, you did a good job slowing down
the poison's path with your breathing.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.940
If you hadn't been able to do that,
you would've turned into a spider long ago.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.240
I'll inject you with the antidote now, okay?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.410
Hurry! Over here, over here!

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.330
Can we get them down?

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.910
Be careful, okay?

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.750 line:20%
It's all good! Everyone's still alive!

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.020
<i>My sword got snapped!</i>

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.230
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.150
<i>The threads this boy is controlling...</i>

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.530
<i>Does this mean they're even tougher
than the body of that demon I couldn't slash?</i>

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.110
<i>Forgive me, Mr. Urokodaki,
Mr. Haganezuka!</i>

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.910
<i>Thanks to my inexperience,
my sword is now broken!</i>

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.620
No, this isn't the time for that!

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.580
<i>Think! Think!</i>

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.880
<i>If I can't slash those threads,</i>

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.050
<i>then let me get right up in his face!</i>

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.050
<i>It's no good!</i>

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.470
<i>Those threads have a life of their own,
and I can't get through their attacks!</i>

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.850
<i>Even though he's holding back
enough not to kill me,</i>

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.230
<i>he's still overwhelming me
to this degree!</i>

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.900
Well?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.490
Do you still refuse to take back
what you just said?

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.490
Fine.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.080
In that case,
you'll get slashed to ribbons.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.330
<i>I can't dodge them all!</i>

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.590
Nezuko!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.470
Nezuko! Nezuko!

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.730
You protected me! I'm sorry!

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.850
A girl emerged from that box
on his shoulders.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.060
But she has the aura of a demon!

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.820
Hey, you...

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.740
Is that...

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.490
That girl...

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.830 line:20%
Is she your sibling?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.660
So what if she is?

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.830
<i>The wound's so deep!</i>

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.670
<i>Her left wrist is about to fall off!</i>

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.050
<i>Hurry up and heal! Hurry up and heal!
Hurry up and heal!</i>

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.130
Siblings...

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.510
Siblings...

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.970
The sister's been turned into a demon.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.260 line:20%
R-Rui?

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.260
Yet, she stays by his side.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.480
The younger sister
protected the elder brother.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.350
Risking her own life...

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.900
That's a genuine bond!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.070
I want it!

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.570
W-Wait a minute!

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.610
Wait a minute! Please!

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.820
I'm your elder sister!
Don't desert me!

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.700
Shut up!

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.880
None of you ever managed
to fulfill the roles you were given.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.880
Never. Not once.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.390
W-Wait.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.390
I was the elder sister you wanted, wasn't I?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.310
Give me a chance to redeem myself!

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.400
In that case, go kill those people
wandering all over this mountain.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.820
If you do that, I'll forgive you
for what just happened.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.280
F-Fine.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.200
I'll go kill them.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.250
Boy...

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.000
Boy, let's talk.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.420
Come on out.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920
<i>Boy?</i>

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.920
<i>Talk?</i>

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.140
The thing is, I was really moved.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.930
Seeing the bond you two share
gave me the chills.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.440
I doubt there are any words in this universe
that can describe how moved I was.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.060 line:20%
But now the only thing left
for you is death by my hand.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.110 line:20%
It would be sad
if it were to come to pass, right?

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:16.660
But there's just one thing.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.330
Just one thing that will
let you escape that.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.200
Your sister...

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.580
Give your sister to me.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.250
If you hand her over without a fight,
I'll at least spare your life.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.430 line:20%
I have no idea what you're talking about!

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.640
Your little sister will be my little sister.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.010
Starting today.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.270 line:20%
You don't actually think
I'd ever agree to that!

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.850
Not to mention, Nezuko's not a thing!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.320
She has her own feelings and will!

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.530
There's no way she'll ever be your sister!

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.780
It's all right.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.530
No need to worry.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.820
Because I'll create a bond between us.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.200
I'm stronger than you.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.450
I'm talking about the bond of terror.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.120
I'll teach her what will happen
if she defies me.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.710 line:20%
I've had enough of this crazy talk!

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.260
Using terror to shackle someone
hand and foot is not the bond of a family!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.380
Unless you fix that basic misunderstanding,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.100
you'll never get what you desire!

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.600
So irritating.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.850
Would you mind not shouting?

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.020
We don't see eye to eye, do we?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.900
I'll never hand Nezuko over to you!

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.240
That's okay, I guess.
I'll just kill you and then take her.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.030
I'll cut off your head first!

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.740
That's the spirit!

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.500
I'd like to see you try it.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:55.000 position:80% line:50%
LOWER FIVE

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.340 line:20%
That is, if you can actually defeat
a Twelve Kizuki like me!

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:05.350
Family...

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.890
A father has his role as the father,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.310
and the mother has
her role as the mother.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.570
The parents protect the children,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.280
and the elder brother and sister
protect their younger siblings.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.570
No matter what.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.700
At the risk of their own lives.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.160 line:20%
The way I see it,

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.580 line:20%
if you don't understand your own role,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.500 line:20%
there's no reason for you to live.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.170
What about you?

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.840
What is your role?

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.550
Your role is to relinquish
your younger sister to me and disappear.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:48.310
If you can't do that,
your only option is to die.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.190 line:20%
Because you can't defeat me.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.190
<i>Lower Five...</i>

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.230
<i>Just as I thought! That power...</i>

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.110
<i>This kid is a true Twelve Kizuki!</i>

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.070 line:20%
<i>It won't be easy to slash those threads.</i>

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.620 line:20%
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.700 line:20%
<i>With this broken sword...</i>

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.500 line:20%
<i>If that kid's neck turns out to be
tougher than the threads...</i>

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.040
I don't like that look in your eyes.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.630
Glittering like that...

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.630
What a fool you are.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.250
Don't tell me...

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.300
you think you're going to beat me?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.510
Nezuko!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.810
All right, I've taken her now.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.520
Now, do you recognize
what your own role is?

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.980
Let her go!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.650
But I told you I'd spare your life,
at least, if you didn't defy me.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.500
Nezuko's gone!

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.460
Nezuko!

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.350
Stop that hollering.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.770
I'm sure that's not enough to kill her.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.310
After all, she's a demon.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.230
But it looks like I'll have to teach her
a lesson after all.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.570
I'm going to let her bleed for a while.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.990
If she still doesn't learn to be docile,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.490
I'll just leave her like that until daybreak...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.950
and let her roast a bit.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.660
You let Nezuko...

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.410
Let her go!

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.270
Look, you...

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.520
I'm sure I'm mistaken, but...

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.190
You don't think that if you get close enough
to me, you can chop off my head, do you?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.700
Fine by me. Here. Give it a shot.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.710
<i>The blade...</i>

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.670
<i>won't go through!</i>

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.800
Didn't I tell you?

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.430 line:20%
You have no chance against me.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.770
My body is more durable
than any thread I manipulate.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.190
If you can't even slash those threads,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.150
you don't have a chance in hell
of slashing my neck.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.290
<i>S-So powerful.</i>

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.630
<i>His power is on a whole different level
than any other demon I've fought!</i>

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.010
<i>So, this is a Twelve Kizuki's...</i>

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.340
<i>The power of a demon
closely related to Kibutsuji?</i>

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.430
You're making too much noise.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.850
Quiet down a bit.

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.770
Stop that!

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.110
I'm your elder brother now.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.530
Enough of that infernal wailing.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.080
<i>Calm down! Don't get emotional!</i>

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.790
<i>If you keep this up,
you'll be playing right into his hands!</i>

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.920
Did she pass out?

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:47.460
Is she asleep?

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.840
This demon has a unique aura.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.680
There's something about her
that's not like the rest of us.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.800
Interesting.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.560
<i>Concentrate!</i>

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.350
<i>Control your breathing!</i>

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.980
<i>Unleash the most precise, final Form!</i>

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.480 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.320
You still don't realize how futile it is?

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.370
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:18.700
<i>Tenth Form!</i>

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.750
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.340 line:20%
<i>I slashed them!
I was able to slash the threads!</i>

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.800
<i>Gathering force with each rotation...</i>

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.300
<i>This could be trouble.</i>

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.970
<i>I can do it!</i>

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.060
<i>If I can keep closing the distance
between us, I can defeat him!</i>

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.400
Hey...

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.110
You don't think these threads
are at maximum strength, do you?

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.320
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.740
<i>Cutting Thread Cage.</i>

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.070
I have no more use for you.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.320
Goodbye.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.740 line:20%
<i>No good!</i>

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.330 line:20%
<i>I can't slash these threads!</i>

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.410 line:20%
<i>I'm still not getting enough spin!</i>

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.540
<i>These are giving off a totally different
scent than the other threads!</i>

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.670
<i>But I can't afford to lose no matter what!</i>

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.460 line:20%
<i>I'm gonna die!</i>

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.590 line:20%
<i>I'm gonna lose!</i>

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.510
<i>I'm...</i>

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.910
<i>Father...</i>

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.870
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.000
<i>Breathe.</i>

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.340
<i>Get your breathing under control
and become Hinokami.</i>

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.020
<i>Tanjiro?</i>

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:04.770
<i>Look.</i>

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.730
<i>It's your father's kagura dance.</i>

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.230
<i>Our family works with fire,</i>

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.650
<i>so to ward off injuries and disasters,</i>

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.030
<i>we offer this dance to Hinokami,
along with our prayers, on New Year's Day.</i>

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.620
<i>Hey, Mother...</i>

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:33.210
How can Father dance like that in the snow
for so long when he's so frail?

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.550
<i>I bet my lungs would freeze.</i>

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.600 line:20%
<i>There's a breathing technique.</i>

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.480 line:20%
<i>A way to breathe so that you won't exhaust
yourself, no matter how much you move.</i>

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.060
<i>Breathe?</i>

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.900
<i>Right.</i>

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.690
<i>If you can master the correct way to breathe,</i>

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.320
<i>you'll be able to dance forever, too.</i>

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.160
<i>The cold won't bother you, either.</i>

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.910
<i>Tanjiro,</i>

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.950
<i>if nothing else, make sure
this kagura and these earrings</i>

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.500
<i>get passed down to you uninterrupted.</i>

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.920
<i>That's what I promised.</i>

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.300
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.350
<i>Dance!</i>

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.560
<i>The threads...</i>

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:31.600
<i>Don't stop!</i>

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.190
<i>Keep running!</i>

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.940
<i>If you stop now,</i>

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.980
<i>it'll bring on the repercussions
of forcibly switching</i>

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.700
<i>from Water Breathing
to Hinokami Dance Breathing!</i>

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.490
<i>When that happens,</i>

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.200
<i>I'll be immobile for a while!</i>

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.160
<i>That's why I gotta do it now!</i>

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
<i>Run!</i>

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.960
<i>You gotta protect Nezuko!</i>

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.550

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.480 line:20%
<i>I see the Opening Thread!</i>

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.020
<i>You gotta take him down now!</i>

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.030
<i>Even if it means...</i>

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.530
<i>getting slashed by him at the same time!</i>

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.990
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:26.580
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.450
<i>Wake up, Nezuko.</i>

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.370
<i>You have to save your brother.</i>

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.170
<i>I know you can do it now, Nezuko.</i>

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.000 line:20%
<i>Do your best.</i>

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.470
<i>Please, Nezuko.</i>

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.020
<i>Or your brother will be killed, too!</i>

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.730

<i>The threads burned and snapped!</i>

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.790
The bond between Nezuko and me...

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.790
can't be...

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.800
severed by anyone!

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.240
I wonder why I suddenly remembered
the Hinokami Kagura at that moment.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.860
Thanks, Father.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.200
Thanks to that, I was able to slice
through that demon's neck with my blade!

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.450
Thanks to you, too, Nezuko!

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.580
This week, I have a Taisho secret
about the Kamado Family!

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.170
After every festival, Father and Mother
would always toast rice crackers for us.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.460
Those were good times, making
loud cracking noises while we ate them!

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.800
Thanks, Nezuko.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.720
This is no time
to bask in memories, right?

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.850
Next, Episode 20, "Pretend Family"!

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.770
Did I actually... defeat a Twelve Kizuki?
