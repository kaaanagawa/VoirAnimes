Dear, what's the matter?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.360
Dear?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.870
Stop!

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.010
EPISODE 8:
THE SMELL OF ENCHANTING BLOOD

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.550
What's this?

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.470
What's going on?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.850
I-Is that blood?

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.810
Stop it!

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.820
Dear!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.450
Ma'am!

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.410
You need to worry about yourself!

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.160
Please take a cloth
and press down hard on the wound!

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.670
<i>It's all right.
Somehow, it's going to turn out fine.</i>

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.040 line:20%
<i>The wife's wound isn't fatal!</i>

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.670 line:20%
Do it harder!

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420
Do it harder! Tie it up with a rope!

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.220
<i>It's going to be all right.</i>

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.430
<i>This man hasn't killed anyone!</i>

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.680
<i>Just a second ago, this man
was just walking down this street!</i>

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.560
Are you all right?

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.690
You mustn't look.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.650
It's dangerous here, Rei.
Let's move over there.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.940
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.960 line:20%
<i>Dammit!</i>

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.210
<i>Dammit!</i>

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.920
<i>I can't leave this man here!</i>

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.510
Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.840
I'm not letting you get away!

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.430 line:20%
No matter where you go!

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.520
What's the matter with that child?

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.440
What do you think, Tsukihiko?

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.400 line:20%
No matter where you go,
you're not getting away!

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.400
I'll follow you to the ends of Hell,

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.110
and I swear I'll slice off
your head with my blade!

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.620
I'll never forgive you no matter what!

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.370
What the hell are you doing?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.790
Is it a drunk?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.210
Kid, step away from that man!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.250
I can't!

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.040
Bring some restraints please!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.040
Please!

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.710
Shut up and step away!

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.130 line:20%
Please don't do that!

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.460 line:20%
No one can hold
this person down but me!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.260 line:20%
Move!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.720 line:20%
Please don't do that!

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.800
Just look at this guy's face!
Has he lost his mind?

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.560
Pull the kid off him!

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.020
Please stop!

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.060
I don't want this person to kill anyone!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.560
Just stay out of my way, will you?
I'm begging you!

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.520 line:20%
Dammit! Look, you...

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.070 line:20%
If you're going to keep resisting...

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.330
Enchanting Blood.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.410
Aroma of Visual Fantasy.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.080 line:20%
<i>What's this scent?</i>

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.960 line:20%
What are all these patterns?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.840
What's going on? I can't see anything!

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.140
<i>Is this some kind of attack?</i>

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.800
<i>If it is, that means trouble!</i>

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.220
<i>Is the scent growing stronger?</i>

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.230
You still use...

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.740 line:20%
the term "person"...

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.700
to refer to even a transformed demon.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.490
And you're trying to save him.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.750 line:20%
Allow me, then, to lend you a hand.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.750
But why?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.830
You...

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.460
Your scent tells me...

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.460
That's right.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.960
I am...

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800 line:20%
...a demon, but I am also a doctor,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.520 line:20%
and I wish to annihilate
that man, Kibutsuji.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.520
Aren't you coming, Daddy?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.610
Daddy has work.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.070
I have a business meeting to attend.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.030
I'm also concerned
about that disturbance just now.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.570 line:20%
Dear...

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.870 line:20%
Don't worry.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.660 line:20%
I'm only going to speak with the police.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.540
Now, get in.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.630
Daddy, come home soon, okay?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.380
All right. You be a good girl now.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.260
Take them back to the house.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.680
Go on.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.480
Big Bro, let's hit one more bar!

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.990
Yacchan, are you okay?

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.740
I'm fine! I'm fine!

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.490
I'm not even drunk yet—

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.410
What the hell, you bastard?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.330
Forgive me.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920
Hey, come back here!

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.760
I'm very sorry,
but I happen to be in a hurry, so...

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.130
What did you say?

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.300
Hey, look at you, decked out
in those posh-looking threads!

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.010
You piss me off!

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.980
You and your pale face...

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.520
You look like you're about to fall over dead!

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.610
Hey, say something, will you?
Or did you just croak?

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.530
Yacchan!

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.370
What did you do to my kid brother?

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.910
Yacchan!

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.120
He's dead!

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.500
Yacchan's not breathing!

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.290
You bastard!

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.690
Does my complexion
look unhealthy to you?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.070
Is my face pale?

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.830 line:20%
Do I look sickly to you?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.000
Do I look like I'm not long
for this world?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.790
Do I look like I'm about to die?

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.000
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.380
I'm a living being
who's infinitely close to perfection.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.230
What do you think will happen
if I keep flooding you with my blood?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.410 line:20%
The human body is unable to withstand
the speed of transformation.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.500
And its cells are destroyed.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:14.150
Bring me the head of the Demon Slayer
who wears hanafuda-like earrings.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.910
Understood?

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.030
As you wish.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.990
Your wish is our command.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.090
Those earrings...

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.100
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.020 line:20%
Now, listen to me! Here's the deal...

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.270
My point is this, okay?

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.320
It's not about the money!

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.530
What I can't forgive is your lack of intent
to eat my udon, all right?

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.410
I'm so sorry!
Please serve me another bowl!

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.620
So, you're gonna eat it?

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.410
Yes!

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.040
You're definitely gonna eat it?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.120
Yes, I shall!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.410
Okay!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.710
You, too!

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.710
If you're gonna have udon,
take off that bamboo thingie first!

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.170
What is that thing anyway?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.300
Take these chopsticks! Chopsticks!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.930 line:20%
I'd like a bowl of udon!

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.850 line:20%
I'd like two bowls of udon!

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.470 line:20%
R-Right.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.490
Thank you very much for the meal!

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.360
That was delicious!

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.580
As long as you get it! It's all good!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.870
Thanks for your business!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.580 position:80% line:50%
UDON

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.160
Sorry about that, Nezuko.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.210
Leaving you behind like that...

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.040
What's wrong, Nezuko?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.680
So, you've been waiting for us?

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.180
Because I was told
to bring you to see her.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.520
I could've tracked you by scent.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.810
She's in a place
that's under a cloaking spell.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.610
No way could you find it.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.570
Cloaking?

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.610
Anyway...

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.490
Isn't that woman a demon?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.490
And an eyesore to boot.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.910
<i>Eyesore?</i>

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.460
<i>Eyesore?</i>

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.880
<i>Does he mean "ugly"?</i>

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.500
<i>Who?</i>

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.090
<i>Nezuko?</i>

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.510 line:20%
Who in their right mind
would call her an eyesore?

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.890 line:20%
Just take a good look at her features!

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.720
She was the beauty
of our hometown! Our Nezuko!

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.440
Let's go.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.060
Sure, we'll go, but still...

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.060
No way is she an eyesore!
Not on your life!

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.480 line:20%
Take a look at her
where there's a bit more light!

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.490 line:20%
Come on, let's go over there!

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.080
Oh, I know what it is!
It's this muzzle, right?

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.160
It might be because of this muzzle!

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.380
I'd like you to behold Nezuko
without the muzzle!

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.170
Hurry it up.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.880
While no one's around.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.560
There's a house
behind the dead end!

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.190
Get over here!

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.070
Listen. Make sure you don't offend
that person in any way.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.990
Personally, I couldn't care less
what happens to you.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:47.070
But I brought you here
because she insisted!

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.700
R-Right.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.200
Come in.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:54.830
I have returned.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.920
Welcome back.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.550
I'm sorry that I left you
to take care of things just now.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.970
How is the lady?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.590
She'll be just fine.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.850
Unfortunately, I have to keep
her husband restrained in the basement.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.110
Isn't treating human wounds
unbearable for you?

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:28.570
You think demons treat humans while choking
back their own drool at the smell of blood?

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.040
Sorry.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.620
Stop it. Why would you
resort to violence?

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.340
I never introduced myself, did I?

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.840
My name is Tamayo.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.720
That boy is Yushiro.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.970
I hope that you'll be his friend.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.020
<i>I don't think that's gonna happen.</i>

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.060
It's not unbearable, you know.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.810
I believe it's much easier for me
than for normal demons.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.820
Because I've tweaked
my body considerably.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.030
I've also removed Kibutsuji's curse.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.950
Curse? T-Tweaked your body?

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.000
Come this way.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.510
Hey, Nezuko, that's bad manners!

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.430
That's quite all right.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.390
Please make yourselves at home.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.480 line:20%
Sorry.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.900 line:20%
Now then, allow me to continue.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:44.320 line:20%
I adjusted our bodies so that we can live
without devouring humans.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.070 line:20%
A small amount of human blood
is all we need.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.610
Blood?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.320
You mean...

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.410
You may find it distasteful,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.830
but what I do is buy blood

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.870
under the guise of transfusions
from those unable to make ends meet.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.880
Of course, no more
than would impair them.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.880
<i>I see.</i>

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.720
<i>So, that's why I'm not picking up that strange
scent unique to demons from these two.</i>

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:13.890
<i>But they do need human blood after all.</i>

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.310
<i>If blood is all they need, then Nezuko...</i>

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.310
Yushiro can get by with even less blood.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.060
I'm the one who turned him
into a demon.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.440
You did that?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.780
But...

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.860
You're right.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.700
It's generally held that no one
but Kibutsuji can reproduce demons.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.120
That's more or less accurate.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.120 line:20%
After more than 200 years,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.040 line:20%
I was only able to transform Yushiro
into a demon after all.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.340
Two...

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.090
Two hundred years...

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.260
You were only able to transform Yushiro
after more than 200 years?

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.230
Exactly how old are you, Miss Tamayo?

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.360
Don't ask a lady her age,
you ill-mannered scoundrel!

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.480
Yushiro!

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.320
The next time you hit that boy,
I'll make you regret it!

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.360
Yes, ma'am!

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.860
<i>She's beautiful even when she's angry!</i>

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.790
There's one thing
I'd like to clear up with you.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.540
I'm not trying to create more demons.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.460
I only perform the procedure
on the terminally ill

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.710
or those so gravely injured
that they don't have long to live.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.680 line:20%
And in those cases,

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.220 line:20%
I always ask them beforehand
if they wish to live on even as demons.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.810
<i>The scent she's giving off is pure
and devoid of deception.</i>

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.230
<i>She's someone I can trust.</i>

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.900
Miss Tamayo,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.570
is there a way to return a transformed
demon back to human form?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.130
See anything?

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.640
I can see.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.640
I can see footprints.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.980
This is it. This is it.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.190 line:20%
Making a huge turn over there.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.030
There are three of them.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.070
And one's carrying some kind of big box.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.540
How should we kill them, I wonder.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.420
I can feel the flow of power.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:51.420
Because of all the blood
he shared with me.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.380
Of course we're going to
slay them vindictively.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.260
There is a way to turn a demon...

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.100
back into a human.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.890
Please tell me how!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.270 line:20%
Don't you dare get so close to Lady Tamayo!

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.650
Yushiro...

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.110
Yes, ma'am! I only threw him.
Lady Tamayo. I did not hit him.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.780
You mustn't do either.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.530
Yes, ma'am!

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.030
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.370
Please tell me how.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.870
For any kind of wound, there's always
some kind of medicine or treatment.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.920
At this time, I'm unable to turn
a demon back into a human,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.880
but surely, that, too...

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.880
However,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:44.470
we are dedicated to establishing
such a method of treatment.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.350 line:20%
Towards that end, I'd like to ask you
to do something for me.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.230
To produce such an elixir,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.570
it is necessary to study
the blood of numerous demons.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.030
I have two favors to ask of you.

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.990
One, permission to study
your sister's blood.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:08.960
Two, to retrieve
blood samples from demons

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.790
as closely related to Kibutsuji
as possible.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:17.170
Nezuko's current condition
is extremely rare and unique.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.430
I understand that she was asleep
for two straight years,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.050
and I believe that her body underwent
changes during that time.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.600
Normally, any demon who went that long

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.270
without consuming the flesh
or blood of a human or beast

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.400
would unquestionably go berserk.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.400
<i>Lady Tamayo is beautiful today, too!</i>

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.820
<i>I'm sure she'll be
beautiful again tomorrow!</i>

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.120
And yet, surprisingly,
Nezuko shows none of those signs.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.000
This miracle will be the key
to finding a solution.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.050 line:20%
The other request I have for you
is a harsh one.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.510
By "demons closely related to Kibutsuji,"

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.770
I meant demons whose powers are more
on par with that of Kibutsuji himself.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.730
It won't be easy to extract blood
from such demons.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.530
Are you still willing
to go along with my requests?

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.540 line:20%
If there's no other way, then I'll do it.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.790 line:20%
If it means you're going to research
all these demons' blood

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.960 line:20%
and create this medicine...

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.670 line:20%
If that happens, that means
it won't just be Nezuko.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.380 line:20%
Lots of other people
will be saved, too, right?

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:48.470
That's right.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.350
Get down!

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.540
Did you decide how to kill them?

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.910
Vindictively, of course!

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.230 position:80% line:20%

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.230 position:20% line:20%
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.070
I'm starting with the Taisho secret today!

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:12.320 position:80% line:20%
LADY TAMAYO

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.990
Yushiro's hobby is to write
in his Lady Tamayo journal.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:12.320
I hear that he churns out
seven to ten pages a day.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.910
And now, I've found that very journal.
Let's take a peek, huh?

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.580
Let's see.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.040
"January 10. Lady Tamayo was ethereal
and gorgeous again today.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.380
At 17:10, she called my name.
Twice, no less!

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.130
Her voice was beautiful.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:31.090
At 17:29, when Lady Tamayo,
deep in thought, slipped on the step..."

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.510
Next, Episode 9,
"Temari Demon and Arrow Demon"!

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.640
Let's pretend we never saw this.
