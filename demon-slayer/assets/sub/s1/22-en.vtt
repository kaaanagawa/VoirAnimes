C'mon, you! C'mon!

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.250
Are you gonna sleep all day?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.120 line:20%
Wake the hell up, will you?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.130
Bummer. I heard he was
a Demon Slayer with a demon in tow,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.720
so I was looking forward
to seeing someone flamboyant,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.760
but that's one drab-looking dude, huh?

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.720 line:20%
And now, we'll put this boy on trial!

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.890 line:20%
I see!

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.900
<i>To think that he's been protecting
his sister who's now a demon...</i>

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.400
<i>Now that's beautiful sibling love!
How brave!</i>

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.160

Just who do you think
is standing before you?

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.540
You're in the presence of the Hashiras!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.790
<i>Hashiras?</i>

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.540
<i>What is a Hashira?</i>

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.880
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.550

This is the Demon Slayers' headquarters.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.070
And you're about to be put on trial...

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.110
Tanjiro Kamado.

EPISODE 22:
MASTER OF THE MANSION

Before we start the trial,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.680
why don't you explain
the crime you've comm—

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680
There's no need for a trial!

FLAME HASHIRA
KYOJURO RENGOKU

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.230
Protecting a demon
is a clear violation of the code!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.810
We're within our rights
to deal with him on our own!

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.110
We're going to behead him
along with the demon!

TENGEN UZUI

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.150
In that case, I'll be glad
to decapitate him flamboyantly.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.660
I'll show you the most flamboyant
bloodspray you'll ever see.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.120
I'm talking max flamboyance.

<i>What?</i>

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.670
<i>You'd kill such an adorable child?</i>

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.130
<i>That pains my heart!
It fills me with anguish!</i>

Ah, what a pitiful sight this boy is.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.800
The poor soul...

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.510
I pity him for having been born at all.

<i>Where's Nezuko?</i>

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.820
<i>Nezuko!</i>

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.280
Hey you...

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.780
The Hashiras are speaking.
What are you looking at?

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.000
These are the nine highest-ranking
swordsmen in the Demon Slayer Corps.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.710
Hashiras...

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.670
Let's put him out of his misery.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.590
Yeah! Let's do it. Flamboyantly.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.800
Hey!

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.340
Nezuko...

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.390
Nezuko, where are you?

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.970
Nezuko!

Murata!

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.060
Forget that.
What will we do with Tomioka?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.280
Seeing him there without any restraints
is giving me a headache.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.370
Based on what Kocho told us,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.040
Tomioka's just as guilty
of breaking the Corps rules.

How will we deal with him?

How should we make him
take responsibility?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.340 line:20%
What kind of lesson
should we teach him?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.380
Don't you have anything to say, Tomioka?

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.680
<i>Because of me, now even Tomioka...</i>

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.810
<i>Iguro, you're as serpent-like
as ever! Such a nag!</i>

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.560
<i>I love how pesky you are!</i>

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.240
<i>Tomioka! All by himself at a distance!</i>

Oh, where's the harm?

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.290
He did come along without resisting.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.540
Let's come up with a penalty later.

INSECT HASHIRA
SHINOBU KOCHO

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.430
What I'm more interested in
is hearing this boy's story.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.100
The reason he's going on missions with a demon
in tow despite being a Demon Slayer...

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.190
I'd like to hear the explanation
from the boy himself.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.610
Needless to say, what he's done
is against the Demon Slayer Corps rules.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.400
You are aware of that, aren't you?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.620
Tanjiro Kamado...

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.120
Why are you traveling with a demon
when you're a Demon Slayer?

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.540
No need to ask.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.510
You can take your time.
Just tell us why.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.720
She's my...

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.300
She's my younger—

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.730
I do believe you need some water.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.740
You've injured your jaw,
so please drink slowly.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.950
It contains a painkiller,
so it will make you feel better.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.090
It's not as if your wounds are healed,
so you mustn't push yourself.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.300
Now then, Tanjiro Kamado...

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.180
That demon is my younger sister!

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.730
While I was away, my family
was attacked by a demon,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.900
and when I got home,
they were all dead!

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.190
My sister got turned into a demon,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.070 line:20%
but she's never devoured anyone!

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.690
She never has...

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.280 line:20%
and never will!

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.530
She'll never hurt humans no matter what!

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.950
Spare us your absurd ravings.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.210
If she's family,
no wonder you're defending her.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.460
I can't trust a single word you're saying.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.920
I, for one, don't believe you.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.090
She's been possessed by a demon.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.180
Let us kill this poor child immediately
so that she can be liberated!

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.850
Listen to me please!

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.770
I became a swordsman
so that Nezuko could be cured!

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.230
It's been two years
since Nezuko became a demon!

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.280
And in all that time,
she hasn't devoured one human!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.200
Your story's spinning
in the most drab way possible, idiot.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.530
The fact that she hasn't eaten anyone,
that she won't from now on.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.700 line:20%
Don't just give us lip service.
Prove it to us with max flamboyance.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.840
What was that bird again?

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.340
Um...

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.050
Excuse me?

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.800
I do have my doubts, you know.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:59.720
I just can't imagine the Master
being in the dark about this situation.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.940
Do you really think it's okay
to deal with him without his permission?

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.190
Shouldn't we at least wait
until he arrives?

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.240
My sister...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.070 line:20%
My sister will fight with me by my side!

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.200
She can fight as a Demon Slayer
to protect humans!

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.450
So please...

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.880 line:50 %
KILL

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.880
Well, well, I see you have
some fun brewing here.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.510
Is that the moron Slayer
who has a demon with him?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.930 line:20%

This won't do, Master Shinazugawa!

What did you say about that demon, kid?

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.300 line:20%
That she can fight as a Demon Slayer

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.550
You know what we call that?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.140 line:20%
A total delusion, you moron!

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.270
Anyone who hurts my sister...

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.530
Hashira or not,
I won't let you get away with it!

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.490
Is that right? Good for you!

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.030
Stop it!

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.910
The Master will be arriving soon!

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.390
Pardon me.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.940
Damn you!

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:20.200
<i>Even though Tomioka ran interference,
he still landed a blow on Shinazugawa.</i>

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.200
If you can't tell the difference
between good demons and bad,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.740 line:20%
you should just quit being a Hashira!

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.710

Good morning, everyone.

The weather is amazingly good today.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.880
I wonder if the sky is blue.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.760
It pleases me that we've made it

I am pleased to see you
in good health, as well, Master.

I fervently pray

Before we start the Hashira Meeting,
would you mind enlightening us

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.270
about this swordsman, Tanjiro Kamado,
accompanied by a demon?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.240 line:20%
<i>He didn't seem to have
a drop of intellect or logic,</i>

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.610 line:20%
<i>but he's speaking so formally now!</i>

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.080 line:20%
Right.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.250 line:20%
I apologize for startling you all.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.960 line:20%
About Tanjiro and Nezuko...
I've sanctioned their situation.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.590
And I'd also like you all to accept it.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.810
Even if it's what you desire,
Master, I cannot agree to it.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.980
I'm flamboyantly opposed, as well!

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.730
A Demon Slayer traveling
with a demon is unacceptable!

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:47.030
I shall do whatever it is you wish, Master!

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.660
I'm fine either way...

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.830
since I'm going to forget anyway.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.460
I won't trust them. I won't trust them.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.380
In the first place, I loathe demons.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.590
Although I respect you with all my heart,
that's an incomprehensible notion, Master!

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.890
I oppose it with everything I've got!

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.390 line:20%
The Demon Slayer Corps' mission
is to annihilate demons.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.390 line:20%
I request that you penalize
both Kamado and Tomioka!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.520
The letter.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.230
Yes, Master.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.830
This is a letter received
from a former Hashira,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.120
Sakonji Urokodaki.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.830
I shall read you an abridged version.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:50.170
"Please allow Tanjiro to be accompanied
by his sister, a demon.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.590 line:20%
Because of her resilient mental strength,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.510 line:20%
Nezuko has not lost her human emotions.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.100
<i>Even in a starved state,
she never devoured humans,</i>

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.850
<i>and this has held true
more than two years later.</i>

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.940
<i>Although the situation seems somewhat
far-fetched, it is an indisputable fact.</i>

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:14.700
<i>In the event that Nezuko does assault
a human, Tanjiro Kamado, as well as...</i>

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:20.830
...Sakonji Urokodaki and Giyu Tomioka
will atone by committed seppuku."

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.850 line:20%
So, what if they commit seppuku?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.900
If you want to die,
then rot to death for all I care!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.230
It's no guarantee! Not by a long shot!

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.480 line:20%
Shinazugawa is right!

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.450 line:20%
If she kills and devours human,
there's no coming back from that!

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.360 line:20%
It won't bring back
the people who were killed!

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.080 line:20%
You do have a point.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.620
In that case...

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:01.950
Master!

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.290 line:20%
We can't guarantee
that she won't attack humans.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.460 line:20%
We can't prove it.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.340 line:20%
That said...

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.760
We also can't prove
that she will attack humans.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.770 line:20%
The fact is that Nezuko has refrained from
devouring humans for more than two years,

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.400 line:20%
and also that there are three people
risking their lives for her.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.570 line:20%
To reject this notion,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.780 line:20%
those who reject it must offer
an even more convincing argument.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.200
Do you all have the will to do so?

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.080
Also, there's something
I'd like to relay to you, my children.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.880 line:20%
Tanjiro here has met Kibutsuji.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.590 line:20%
No, impossible!

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.800 line:20%
Even when no Hashira has ever
crossed paths with him?

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.010 line:20%
You mean this kid...

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.640 line:20%
What did he look like?
What about his powers?

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.350 line:20%
Where did this take place?

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:07.480
Did you battle him?

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.520 line:20%
What was Kibutsuji doing?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.150 line:20%
Did you find his stronghold?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.440 line:20%
Hey, answer me!

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.240
Shut up! I asked him first!

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.700
First, tell us what powers Kibutsuji has!

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.920
Kibutsuji has sent pursuers after Tanjiro.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.800
Though his purpose may simply
be to silence him,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.760
now that Kibutsuji's given himself away
for the first time, I don't want to let go.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:47.730 line:20%
I also believe something's happening
to Nezuko that Kibutsuji never saw coming.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.980 line:20%
Can you try to understand?

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.990
No, I can't understand, Master.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.780
If it were human, I'd be okay
with letting it live, but not a demon!

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.370
Not after all that we the Demon Slayers
have gone through in battle!

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.250
Not after so many people
have lost their lives!

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.290
It's unacceptable!

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.260
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.600
<i>You're soiling the garden!</i>

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.770
Master!

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:29.890
I will prove it to you myself!

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.610
The sheer ugliness of a demon!

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.570
Sanemi...

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.280
Hey, demon!

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.280
It's time to eat!

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.030
Sink your teeth in this!

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.380
No need to force yourself to hold back.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.760
Just show us your true colors,

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.220
and I'll obliterate you right here!

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.220
Nezuko!

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.810 line:20%
Shinazugawa, it's no good
doing it in the sunlight.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.980 line:20%
We have to go into the shadows,
or the demon won't show its face.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.190
Master,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.320
please forgive this discourtesy.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.830 line:20%
Stop it!

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.330
Come on out, demon!

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.340
Look, it's the human blood
you love so much!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.170
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.920
<i>I can't move!</i>

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.460 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.360
PREVIEW

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.940
Imagine, Shinazugawa falling victim
to a head-butt by a mere rookie.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.740
That was a mighty fine head-butt!

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.780
Yeah! The sound it made was flamboyant!

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.580
How painful it must've been...
Namu Amida Butsu.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.870
But the way that boy stood up
to a Hashira was so brave!

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.370
What is this, a free-for-all?

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.210
You know I could've dodged it
if Tomioka hadn't gotten in the way!

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.540
Excuses, excuses.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.090
I see none of you have changed.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.340
And now, time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.050
The first one among us to speak
gets to greet the Master,

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:33.430
so we all had butterflies in our stomachs
until the Master got here!

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.730
Oh, next, Episode 23, "Hashira Meeting."

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.980
TO BE CONTINUED
