WEBVTT

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.740
I've done a good job until now!

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.950
I have what it takes!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.080
And not today...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.910
or any time in the future!

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.870
Even if I'm broken...

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.010
I'll never give up no matter what!

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.980
EPISODE 13:
SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN LIFE

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320
Where are you, Tanjiro?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.650 line:20%
<i>I can still hear that creepy sound.</i>

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.410 line:20%
<i>Just be safe and sound, Tanjiro!</i>

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.660
Um, Zenitsu,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.160
is it just me, or are we
just going around and around in circles?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.200 line:20%
I knew it!

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 line:20%
I was getting the same feeling!

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.040 line:20%
That's my boy, Shoichi!
I knew I could count on you!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420
All right, could you check to see
if this room is safe?

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.760
What the heck? All right, all right,
just stop giving me that look!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.890
Fine, I'll do it myself!

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.480
There's nobody around.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.730
Let's go this way!

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.360
Tanjiro,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.900
please show up!

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.110
Th-The room...

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.240
just flipped!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.970
<i>I can do it!</i>

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.470
<i>I know I can do it!</i>

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.810
<i>I'm a guy who gets things done!</i>

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.320
<i>Broken bones or not...
No matter what...</i>

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.070
<i>I can do it!</i>

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.490
<i>I can fight!</i>

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.450
<i>Show him how unstoppable you are!</i>

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.080
<i>Broken bones or not!</i>

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.590 line:20%
<i>It's no good! Nothing's changed at all!</i>

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.390 line:20%
<i>Spirit alone isn't gonna get me anywhere!</i>

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.560
<i>Your head...</i>

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.980
<i>Use your head, not just spirit!</i>

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.730 line:20%
<i>Think! Think! Think!</i>

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.150
<i>Close call!</i>

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.490
<i>I barely survived that one!</i>

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.950 line:20%
Damn! This is so annoying!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.410 line:20%
<i>I gotta consume some marechi!
There's no time to lose!</i>

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.540
<i>There isn't even time to stop and think!</i>

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.340
Hey you!

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.420
What's your name?

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.890
Kyogai.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:47.930
Kyogai!

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.520
I'm not handing over Kiyoshi...
the marechi to you!

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.180
I'm not gonna cave!

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.810 line:20%
I'm not giving up!

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.730
<i>Just give it up, will you?</i>

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.240 line:20%
I'm going to get my hands
on some marechi

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.660 position:20% line:50%
LOWER MOON SIX

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.030 line:20%
and reclaim my place
among the Twelve Kizuki!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.960 line:20%
<i>Just give it up, will you?</i>

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.140 line:20%
<i>It's so boring!</i>

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.150
<i>Your writing is just so boring.</i>

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.280
<i>Every last word is utter trash!</i>

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.410
<i>No beauty, no fragility, no impact.</i>

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.160
<i>Why don't you forget about writing?</i>

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.960
<i>It's just a waste of paper and fountain pens!</i>

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.420
<i>You never even step outside
anymore these days.</i>

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.590
<i>So no wonder you're so boring!</i>

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.220
<i>You should just enjoy your hobby,
playing the tsuzumi</i>

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.470
<i>as long as you're shut in here.</i>

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.600
<i>Not that you have the skills
to teach that, either!</i>

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680 line:20%
Out of my sight!

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.260 line:20%
You damn insect!

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.010
Rapid Drumming!

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.600
<i>Don't tell me he can strike
that tsuzumi even faster!</i>

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.790
<i>The speed of these rotations
is making me dizzy!</i>

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.870
<i>This is bad!</i>

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.540
<i>What an amazing skill!</i>

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.880
<i>Not only that,</i>

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.710
<i>but now he's got five claws
instead of three!</i>

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.060
<i>Got it.</i>

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.900
<i>Because I dodged his blows
without stepping on the papers,</i>

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.400
<i>I now know how to move my body
without aggravating my wounds,</i>

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.610
<i>and how to breathe!</i>

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.450
<i>Take shallow breaths. Quickly!</i>

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.290
<i>Use that breathing technique to reinforce
the muscles around your broken leg!</i>

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.790
<i>And right before the claw attack,</i>

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.300
<i>there's the scent of mold!</i>

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.630
<i>Here it comes! The claw attack!</i>

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.890
<i>Above!</i>

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:17.180
<i>Left!</i>

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.260
<i>Right!</i>

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.640
<i>Behind!</i>

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.480
<i>He's evading all of my attacks!</i>

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.360
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.980
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.580
<i>Ninth Form,</i>

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.290
<i>Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent!</i>

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.420
<i>Minimize the landing time and area
as much as possible!</i>

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.250
<i>He's adapting
to the room's orientation changes!</i>

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.960
<i>Go! Get in there!</i>

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.670
<i>Within striking distance!</i>

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.010
<i>Forward!</i>

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.090
<i>Get right up in his face!</i>

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:00.850
<i>I see the Opening Thread!</i>

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.350
Kyogai!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.100
Your Blood Demon Art was incredible!

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.080
<i>Ouch, ouch, ouch!</i>

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.210
<i>I took a deep breath by mistake!</i>

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.380
<i>I'm the eldest son!</i>

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.430
<i>The eldest son!</i>

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.050
Boy...

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.770
Answer me.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.690
You think my Blood Demon Art...

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.980
was incredible?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.950
It was amazing.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.490
But...

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.040
I can't forgive you for killing others.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.710
I see.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.630
Oh, wait. I gotta get a blood sample.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:27.690
<i>It extracted the blood.</i>

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.560
<i>So, it really does extract blood
automatically if you stick it in there.</i>

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.440
<i>That Yushiro sure is skilled,
creating something like this.</i>

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.660
A cat?

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.370
So, you're the one who's going to deliver
this to Miss Tamayo, huh?

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.960
There, there. Thanks!

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.590
Now you're all set.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.630
All right, take care now!

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.380
Hey—

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:05.100
<i>I was told that under Yushiro's spell,
it would be invisible until it meowed,</i>

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.850
<i>and then vanish again
when it meowed a second time.</i>

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.390
<i>So it's true, huh?</i>

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.820
Where are those two?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.900
I gotta search for them!

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.070
<i>My...</i>

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.410
<i>writing...</i>

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.580
<i>Your writing is just so boring.</i>

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.050
<i>Every last word is utter trash!</i>

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.220
<i>No beauty, no fragility, no impact.</i>

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.430
It wasn't trash at all.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.650
At the very least, not to that kid.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.360
He saw fit not to trample on it.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.280
Rest in peace.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.450
Both my Blood Demon Art...

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.960
and my tsuzumi playing...

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.290
have been recognized.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.010
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.020
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.600
Kiyoshi!

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.020
Teruko!

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.600
Kiyoshi!

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.940
Teruko!

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.110
Kiyoshi!

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.190
Teruko!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.740
Tanjiro...

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.740 line:20%
Why are you throwing stuff at me?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000 line:20%
We're so sorry!

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.620 line:20%
The tsuzumi vanished, so we panicked.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.250 line:20%
I see.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.590 line:20%
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.260
You did a good job hanging in there.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.970
You, too, Kiyoshi.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.770
Come on, let's head outside.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.520
Climb onto my back.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.610
Is your leg okay?

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.690
Yes!

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.980
You just have to be brave
a little longer.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.700
I'm picking up
Zenitsu and Shoichi's scent.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.620
They must be outside.
Both of them safe—

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.410
<i>I smell blood!</i>

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160
What's wrong?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:35.540
Nothing.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.920
Let's hurry!

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.970
Take this!

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.470
Move it!

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.640
Take this!

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.850
Draw your sword and fight me!

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.100
You spineless punk!

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.230
Tanjiro...

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.570
I protected it.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.740 line:20%
Because you said...

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.370 line:20%
this was more important
to you than your life.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.670
The thing is...

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.300
<i>I've always had really good hearing.</i>

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.600
<i>One time, I knew
what people said while I was asleep,</i>

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.350
<i>and that creeped everyone out.</i>

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:44.320 line:20%
<i>I'm not hearing any more demon sounds.</i>

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.400 line:20%
<i>Tanjiro, you defeated
that demon, didn't you?</i>

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.040 line:20%
<i>I can hear you guys, and also these
weird-sounding, loud footsteps.</i>

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.250
...itsu! Zenitsu!

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.830
Zenitsu!

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.840
Thank goodness! Are you all right?

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.100
When the room spun around,
we got thrown outside.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.600
We fell from the second-story window.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.060
Did we now?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.570
You were protecting me,
so I'm totally fine. But...

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.820
I'm glad to hear that.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.200
So, tell me, why all the tears?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.160
Now I get it!

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.290
I fell right onto my head, didn't I?

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.630
Yes.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.750
Am I gonna...

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.210
Am I gonna die?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.470
My head is starting to spin.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.470
What's this? What's this? What's this?

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.220
Comin' through! Comin' through!

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.270
There it is again!

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.440
The monster boar!

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.190
I'm getting a demonic vibe.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.070
It's him!

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.110
I was able to tell from his voice!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.360
He's the fifth survivor!

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.240
During Final Selection,

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.450
he was the first to rush up the mountain,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.080
and then he came down
from the mountain before anyone else!

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.620
Mr. Impatient!

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.960
Hey, found it!

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.630
Cut it out!

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.140
Who the hell are you?

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.060
Get out of the way!

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.520
I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma!

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.270
I'm with the Demon Slayer Corps like you!

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.270
Demon Slayer Corps?

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.070
Then I shouldn't have to tell you!

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.530
We gotta get rid of that thing!

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.860
Now, get the hell out of my way!

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.240
I'm not moving!

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.780
This is Tanjiro's—

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.330
Don't argue with me!

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:04.460 line:20%
In that case, I'm gonna demolish him
and the box together!

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.500
I said move it!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.380
Why, you...

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:11.880
Inside this box...

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.550
Inside this box is something
I'm not letting you touch!

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.800
Something precious to Tanjiro!

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.100
Oh, hey, come on!

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.770
What are you talking about?

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.190
There's a demon inside that box!

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.940
Don't you get that?

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.110 line:20%
I've known that from the very start!

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:33.490
I knew he was traveling with a demon.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.370
Because the sounds demons make
aren't anything like human sounds.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.740
But...

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.960
I can pick up a sound so gentle and kind
from Tanjiro, it makes me want to cry.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:51.090
So kind, I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it before.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.680 line:20%
All living creatures
constantly give off sounds.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.010 line:20%
The world is full
of all these sounds spilling out.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:05.270
Breathing, heartbeats,
the sound of blood circulating...

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.100
By listening closely,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.110
I could tell what someone was thinking.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.610
But I've been deceived by others
time and time again.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:21.240
I've always believed
in whomever I wanted to believe in.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.870
Tanjiro, despite being a Demon Slayer,
is traveling with a demon.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.750
But I'm sure he has a reason for that.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.720
And that it's a reason I can accept!
I believe that!

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.930
I...

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.270
I'm going to ask Tanjiro directly myself!

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.140
So, you...

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.310
You can just back off!

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.860
Let go of me, dammit!

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.120
You're so annoying!

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.540
You're not laying a finger on that!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.050
That's something...

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.840
precious to Tanjiro!

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.260
You're not touching it until he gets back!

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.680 line:20%
Damn you!

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.060
Take this!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.940
Move it!

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.360
I won't!

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.910
Take this!

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.450
Move it!

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.580
Take this!

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.790
Draw your sword and fight me!

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.040
You spineless punk!

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:56.920
Tanjiro...

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.550
I protected it.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.680 line:20%
Because you said...

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.310 line:20%
this was more important to you...

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.560
than your life.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.520
After all that bluster,

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.490
you won't even draw your sword,
you dumbass?

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.490 line:20%
If you're a fellow Demon Slayer,
then let's see you fight!

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.380
If you're not gonna fight,
get the hell out of my way!

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.260 line:20%
Move it!

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.730
Enough!

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.940 line:20%
If you won't get out of my way,

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.030
I'll just have to skewer you
along with that box!

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.160
Knock it off!

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.670
Knock it off!

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:15.910 position:80% line:20%
PREVIEW

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:15.910 position:20% line:20%
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.690
That was some Blood Demon Art

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.610
to make the room spin around and still attack!

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.240
Maybe the closer a demon is to Kibutsuji,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.620
the more potent and troublesome
his Blood Demon Art will be.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.200
I wonder if I really have
a chance of beating them.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.250
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.830
Kyogai, the demon in that house, is a fan
of "The Legend of the Eight Samurai,"

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.500
and I hear that he was writing
a biographical novel of his own.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.720
Right, this is no time to be banged up!

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.180
Next, Episode 14,
"The House with the Wisteria Family Crest."

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.800
Your big brother's gonna kick some butt!

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.640
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
I forgot about my broken bones!

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.020
