00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.310
<i>The blood of the Twelve Kizuki</i>

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.730
<i>should have a high degree
of Kibutsuji's blood.</i>

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.820
<i>If I can extract it,</i>

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.240
<i>the medicine that will turn Nezuko
back into a human can be completed sooner!</i>

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.030
Hold on! Inosuke!

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.330
So, did you defeat it?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.040
Are you all right, Inosuke?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.710
I asked you whether you defeated
that thing or not!

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.800
Uh, yeah, I did!

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.170
But anyway, Inosuke,
how are you feeling?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.550
Don't go showering me
with your sensitivity and kindness!

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.890
You hear me? Got that?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.560
After all, anything you can do,
I can do, too!

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.560
Before you know it,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.560
my head will be harder than yours!

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.690
Not to mention... Not to mention...

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.820
Um...

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.570
<i>He's wounded severely.</i>

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.820
<i>I couldn't save our other friends, either.</i>

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.290
<i>That person gave off
the scent of terror and suffering.</i>

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.670
<i>Enough to make her yearn for death.</i>

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.920
<i>What's the deal
with this mountain anyway?</i>

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.510
<i>With one of the Twelve Kizuki present...</i>

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.510 line:20%
Stay still, Inosuke!

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.800 line:20%
Cut that out! I don't need that!

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.800
<i>...and a demon family living here...</i>

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.180 line:20%
I'm totally fine!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.640
<i>But...</i>

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.060
<i>I thought demons never herded together!</i>

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.570
Ouch!

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.820
<i>Something just pricked me!</i>

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.160
<i>What the hell? This is so annoying!</i>

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.080
I can't find Tanjiro and Inosuke
anywhere! This sucks!

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.490
Where did they go?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.910
Which way?

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.670
And it stinks around here, too! Stinks!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.040 line:20%
I think I'm gonna cry!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.300
And this sound of spiders
rustling around is so creepy!

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.840
I'm sure these spiders are doing their best
to survive, too, but still!

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.430
Dammit! Shut up! Just stay still!

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.980 line:20%
Is this even possible?

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.990
EPISODE 17:
YOU MUST MASTER A SINGLE THING

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.710
That's a spider with a human face!

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.330
What's up with that? What's up with that?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.750
Please be a dream! Please be a dream!
Please be a dream!

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.840 line:20%
If this can just be a dream,
I promise to do my best!

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.760 line:20%
If I wake up to find myself
resting my head on Nezuko's lap,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.760 line:20%
then I promise to give it all I have!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.390
I'll even plow fields!

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.270
I'll be glad to plow a whole acre,
no, even two acres!

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.730
So, please!

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.770
Let me wake up from this nightmare!

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.790
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.330
<i>Are those humans
who got turned into spiders?</i>

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.300 line:20%
<i>Is that house floating?</i>

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.260 line:20%
<i>I can see a glimpse of something,
but are those threads?</i>

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.130
<i>And it really stinks!</i>

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.180
<i>Talk about pungent!</i>

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.180 line:20%
<i>This would kill Tanjiro
with his keen sense of smell!</i>

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.600
<i>This smell is making my throat ache!</i>

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.190
<i>I'm tearing up!</i>

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.770
<i>My eyes hurt, too!</i>

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.030 line:20%
<i>It's huge!</i>

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.700
<i>It's huge! It's huge!</i>

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.460
<i>It's so huge!</i>

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.210
<i>That thing is too huge!</i>

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.340
You know what! I refuse to speak
with anyone like you!

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.560
It's no use running away.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.680
You're already losing.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.690
What are you muttering about?

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.610
I don't wanna hear it,
so stop talking to me!

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.020
I don't like guys like you, all right?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.030
You already know
how dire your situation is, don't you?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.490
What are you talking about?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.240
Take a look at your hands.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.530
My hands?

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.580
What's wrong with my hands—

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.080
What's this?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.670
It's poison.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920
You got bitten by a spider, right?

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.840
That poison will turn you into a spider, too.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.800
In another 30 minutes,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.560
you'll be my slave, crawling all over the ground!

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.310
Look at this. It's a clock.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.600
Do you understand?

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.860
By the time this long hand
goes around once,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.860
you'll have become
a member of the spider clan!

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.490
When the needle arrives here, you'll start
to feel tingling and pain in your limbs.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.620
When it's here,
you'll also feel dizzy and nauseous!

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.620
Here, you'll experience intense pain,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.870
your body will start to shrink,
and you'll black out!

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.920
And by the time you wake up...

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.890
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.900
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.500
Running away...

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.170
...is futile! Right, right, right!

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.710
I know that, all right? I know that!

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.670
What do you think you're doing?

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.930
Shut up! Just shut up!

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.350
There's no need to be afraid.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.270
Once the poison makes its rounds and you turn
into a spider, you'll lose all intelligence, too!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.640
No! That's just what I don't like about this!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.650
Why can't you understand that, huh?

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.480
I have no friends or girlfriend,
all right? No one will like me!

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.360
Huh! I can see that you want an extra dose
of poison to turn into a spider faster.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.620
No! No! I don't want to turn into that!

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.620
<i>Get a hold of yourself!</i>

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.750 line:20%
<i>Stop crying! Stop running away!</i>

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.300 line:20%
<i>Doing that won't get you anywhere!</i>

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.880
<i>Zenitsu!</i>

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.800
<i>Come down from there!
We're going to continue training!</i>

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.300
<i>Oh no! I'm sure I'll die
if I do any more training!</i>

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.310 line:20%
<i>I'm sure that I'll die, so...</i>

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.810
<i>You won't die!
Not from this level of training!</i>

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.980
<i>Come down from there, you little moron!</i>

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.270
<i>Gramps!</i>

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.190
<i>Call me "Master"!</i>

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.690
<i>But I love you, Gramps!</i>

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.160
<i>When the girl I loved made me raise money
so she could run off with another guy,</i>

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.950
<i>you did rescue me
from my mountain of debt!</i>

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.620 line:20%
<i>Well, maybe all you wanted
was to train a swordsman!</i>

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.710
<i>I want to live up to your expectations, too!</i>

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.380
<i>But it's totally beyond me!</i>

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.380
<i>I do feel terrible
about the fact that I'm like this!</i>

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.970
<i>Just so you know, I've been training
on my own in secret, too!</i>

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.890
<i>I haven't been getting any sleep!</i>

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.510
<i>But I have absolutely nothing
to show for it!</i>

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.980
<i>What does this mean?
I mean, really, what does this mean?</i>

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.900
<i>Calm down, Zenitsu!
You do have the ability to...</i>

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.900 line:20%
<i>I've had enough!</i>

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.110
<i>Zenitsu!</i>

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.160
<i>How tragic is my life anyway?</i>

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.540
<i>I got hit by lightning.</i>

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.660
<i>My hair color changed.</i>

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.840
<i>I was thankful just to be alive, but...</i>

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.130 line:20%
<i>I...</i>

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.300 line:20%
<i>I hate myself more than anyone else.</i>

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.180
<i>I always think
I have to get my act together,</i>

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.600
<i>but I end up cowering,
running away, sniveling.</i>

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.650
<i>I want to change.
I want to be a competent person.</i>

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.240
Even still!

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.740 line:20%
I'm doing everything I can, all right?

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.490 line:20%
So, why do I have to end up going bald
and turning into a monster?

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.990 line:20%
It can't be true, right? It so can't be true!

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.000
<i>What's up with this guy?</i>

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.500
Oh, crap! Don't climb up here!

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.920
Just leave me alone for a minute!

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.180
Just for a minute, all right?

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.850
<i>My hair's falling out already?</i>

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.810
<i>My hair is falling out.</i>

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.940
<i>Hey, he never mentioned that part to me!</i>

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.040
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.210
<i>Isn't he a demon hunter
who came here to kill our family?</i>

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.000 line:20%
<i>Did he just faint?</i>

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.340 line:20%
<i>I can't believe how spineless he is.</i>

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.670
<i>He's gonna fall onto his head and die.</i>

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.890
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.230
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form.</i>

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.910
<i>Poison Sputum!</i>

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.460
<i>Did he just twist his body
in midair to dodge that?</i>

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.130
<i>Such quick reflexes!
It's like he's a totally different person!</i>

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.130
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form.</i>

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.430
Hey, you guys! Pounce on him!

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.230
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form.</i>

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.650
<i>He's been assuming
the same stance over and over.</i>

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.450
<i>No question about it. This guy...</i>

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.370
<i>is only capable of that one attack!</i>

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.080
<i>That's all right, Zenitsu.</i>

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.210
<i>That's good enough for you.</i>

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.750
<i>If you can master one,
that's cause for celebration!</i>

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.720
<i>If you can only do a single thing,
hone it to perfection.</i>

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.810
<i>Hone it to the utmost limit!</i>

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.600
<i>Hey, but Gramps...</i>

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.310
<i>Just a little while ago,
you were hopping mad.</i>

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.980
<i>Because Thunder Breathing has six forms,
and all I can manage to do is one.</i>

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.240
<i>Do you know how to forge a sword?</i>

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.410
<i>I have no idea.</i>

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.250
<i>Will you keep hitting me? I think I'll cry.</i>

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.290
<i>The thing about swords...</i>

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.790
<i>You strike and strike and strike</i>

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.340
<i>to get rid of impurities
and anything you don't need,</i>

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.880
<i>and to increase the purity of the blade,
so a durable sword can be forged.</i>

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.390 line:20%
<i>So that's why you keep
clobbering me day in, day out?</i>

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.640 line:20%
<i>But I'm not made of steel, am I?</i>

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.810 line:20%
<i>I'm living flesh, you know.</i>

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.230
<i>You're not much of a threat, are you?</i>

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.280
<i>You call yourself a demon hunter?</i>

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.070
<i>Any minute now, you'll be rendered
immobile by that poison.</i>

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.870
<i>Zenitsu, perfect it!</i>

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.830
<i>It's all right to cry.</i>

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.790
<i>It's all right to run away!</i>

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.580
<i>Just don't ever give up!</i>

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.170
<i>Just believe.</i>

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.880
<i>You endured all that hellish training!</i>

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.920
<i>You'll be rewarded for that without fail!</i>

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.010
<i>Hone it to the utmost limit!</i>

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.640
<i>Become the most durable blade of all!</i>

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.020
<i>Hone that one thing to perfection!</i>

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.030
<i>Get out of my sight.</i>

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.580
<i>Don't make me repeat myself.
Get out of my sight.</i>

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.580
<i>You know what I'm talking about.</i>

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.460
<i>Aren't you ashamed
of crying like a baby all day long?</i>

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.590
<i>You laggard...</i>

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.260
<i>Any time spent on you is wasted.</i>

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.800
<i>Sensei is an extraordinary man.</i>

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.560
<i>But Gramps said—</i>

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.100
<i>"Gramps"? Don't speak of him
in that familiar way!</i>

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.600
<i>Sensei is a former Hashira!</i>

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.940
<i>Someone who earned the highest title
in the Demon Slayer Corps!</i>

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.070
<i>Almost no one ever gets the chance
to be trained by a former Hashira!</i>

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.830
<i>The time Sensei spends training you
is all for nothing!</i>

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.330
<i>You're an eyesore, okay?
Get out of my sight!</i>

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.620
<i>Why are you here?</i>

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.330
<i>Why do you insist on clinging here?</i>

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.310
<i>I have no parents,
so no one has any hopes for me.</i>

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.690
<i>There's no one who dreams that I'll grasp
or accomplish something one day.</i>

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.400
<i>That I'll prove myself useful to somebody.</i>

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.480
<i>That I'll manage to protect somebody</i>

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.490
<i>and make that person happy,
just once in my life.</i>

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.450
<i>Not even a simple future like that.</i>

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.410
<i>There's no one who hopes that I'll have one.</i>

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.250
<i>If you fail, cry and run away even once,</i>

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.170
<i>they say, "Oh, this guy's no good,"
and they walk away.</i>

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.000
<i>But not Gramps!</i>

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.260
<i>Time and time again,
he steadfastly reprimanded me.</i>

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.520
<i>All those times I kept running away...</i>

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.940 line:20%
<i>Time and time again...</i>

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.020
<i>He'd drag me right back.</i>

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.150
<i>Clearly, he did smack me around
a bit too much.</i>

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.870 line:20%
<i>But he never abandoned me!</i>

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.290 line:20%
Pierce him!
Inject him with more poison!

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.090
That should do it for him!

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:41.100
<i>What's this?</i>

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.100
<i>The air is vibrating.</i>

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.520 line:20%
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form...</i>

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.110
<i>Thunderclap and Flash!</i>

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.030
<i>Sixfold!</i>

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.370
He vanished?

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.440
<i>Did I get slashed?</i>

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.640
<i>Me?</i>

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.310
<i>Slashed?</i>

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.400
<i>By him?</i>

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.860
<i>By a guy like him?</i>

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.280
But that's absurd!

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.160
By a guy who can barely move
his arms and legs?

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.590
<i>Dream...</i>

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.260
<i>It's a happy dream.</i>

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.140
<i>I'm powerful.</i>

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.020
<i>More powerful than anyone.</i>

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.140
<i>I can help the weak and anyone in trouble.</i>

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.190
<i>Anytime.</i>

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.690
<i>Everything that Gramps taught me,</i>

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.690
<i>all the time he spent on me...</i>

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.450
<i>It wasn't for nothing!</i>

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.570
<i>A dream that, thanks to Gramps,</i>

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.290
<i>I became powerful
and helped out a lot of people.</i>

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.130
<i>But now, it's all over!</i>

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.300 line:20%
Chuntaro...

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.390
I'm so sorry.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.820
<i>Don't ever give up!</i>

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.250
<i>Don't ever give up.</i>

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.920
<i>Use the breathing technique to slow down
the poison as much as you can.</i>

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.210
<i>Even if it's painful, even if it's agonizing,</i>

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.670
<i>don't try to take the easy way out...</i>

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.880
<i>or Gramps is gonna let you have it!</i>

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.600
<i>Right.</i>

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.890
<i>And Tanjiro's gonna yell at you, too.</i>

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.230 line:20%
What was that sound?

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.190 line:20%
Did lightning just strike?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.690 line:20%
How should I know?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.990
But I'm not smelling any thunderclouds.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.860
The acrid odor in the air
is stronger now, so I can't tell.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:42.990
Inosuke!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.000
I think I'll go that way.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.290
Go ahead and do whatever you want!

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.290
Are you descending, Inosuke?

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.130
Are you going down the mountain?

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.340
Why would I? Just beat it!

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.140
No, no, because you're severely wounded.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.970
I am not wounded at all!

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.860
N-N-No, Inosuke! Your injuries...
Anyone can see that...

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:20.570
<i>A demon!</i>

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.910
<i>Because of the odor wafting
all over this mountain,</i>

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.570
<i>I couldn't pick it up at all!</i>

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.960
I'm gonna tear you to shreds,
you damn demon!

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.270 line:20%
Don't come near my family!

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.280
Stay away!

It's not what it looks like!
That was just a dress code check!

Before you start finding fault
with other people's clothing, fix your hair!
