EPISODE 7:
MUZAN KIBUTSUJI

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.510
Nezuko!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.930
Don't chase after him!

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.560
Get back here!

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.060
Come to me.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.780
Nezuko!

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.000 line:20%
<i>Mr. Urokodaki did tell me...</i>

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.960 line:20%
<i>that Nezuko is a demon now.</i>

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.590
<i>And that she's not necessarily so weak
that I have to protect her.</i>

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.930
<i>Is it all right to let her handle this?</i>

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.600
<i>If I have her watch over those two,
I can focus on my attacks.</i>

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.950
Nezuko!

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.330
Nezuko!

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.960
I'm going underground!

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.290
I want you to protect those two!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.340
You can do that, right?

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.410
<i>Inside a swamp...</i>

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.710 line:20%
<i>And these are...</i>

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.220
<i>Are these the clothes and belongings
of the people who were kidnapped?</i>

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.560
<i>Just look at all the innocent people
they've murdered!</i>

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.390
<i>It's unforgivable!</i>

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.020
<i>Unforgivable!</i>

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.690
Getting hard to breathe, brat?

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.660
There's hardly any air inside this swamp.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.080
On top of that, the darkness coiling
around your body must feel pretty heavy.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.330 line:20%
You can't move the way you would
aboveground! Serves you right!

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.460 line:20%
You should've looked
before you leaped in, you damn fool!

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.600 line:20%
<i>Don't underestimate me!</i>

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.270 line:20%
<i>Just where do you think
I got my training anyway?</i>

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.070
<i>The air was thinner on top of Mt. Sagiri!</i>

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.950 line:20%
<i>Not to mention...</i>

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.040
<i>there are moves that only unleash
their full potential underwater!</i>

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.810
<i>So, they can move at angles
like that inside this swamp?</i>

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.850 line:20%
<i>But it doesn't matter!</i>

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.480 line:20%
<i>All I have to do is slash
when they get near enough to attack!</i>

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.440
<i>The form that can be utilized
even when there's no sure footing...</i>

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.740
<i>Generating a powerful vortex</i>

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.280
<i>with a violent twist
of my upper and lower body!</i>

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.000
<i>Here comes the scent!</i>

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.040
<i>The opening thread!</i>

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.000
<i>Total Concentration!</i>

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.210
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.220
<i>Sixth Form!</i>

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.550
<i>Whirlpool!</i>

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.210
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.840
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.590
<i>Nezuko!</i>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.790
<i>This girl is powerful!</i>

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.710
<i>She doesn't seem to have mastered
any morphing skills yet,</i>

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.840
<i>but look how strong she is anyway!</i>

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.510
<i>She must have gotten
a huge amount of blood from him!</i>

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.350
<i>She moves so fast!
I can't dive back into the swamp!</i>

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.940
<i>But hey,</i>

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.940 line:20%
<i>I'm getting used
to these one-note attacks of hers!</i>

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.200
<i>Even if she kicks my head clean off...</i>

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.740
<i>Even if my internal organs explode,</i>

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.040
<i>demons can regenerate in a flash!</i>

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.420
<i>All right!</i>

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.390
<i>Now I'm gonna drill a hole
right through your face!</i>

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.980
Hands off my sister!

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.330
<i>Did I just get taken out?</i>

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.960
<i>Both of my other selves
got taken out by this guy!</i>

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.340
You give off a scent like rotten oil.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.720
It's a horrible smell!

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.010
How many people have you killed?

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.970
Listen!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.680
If women live any longer,
they turn ugly and start tasting like crap!

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.810
So, we killed them for their own good!

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.360
You should be thankful to us demons—

00:09:58.450 --> 00:09:59.820
Never mind.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.670
You're going to tell me
what you know about Muzan Kibutsuji.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.690 line:20%
Talk to me!

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.020
Start talking!

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.230
I-I can't tell you.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.200
I can't tell you!

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.040
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.460
I can't tell you!

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.680
I can't tell you!

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.470
<i>You mustn't tell.</i>

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.060
<i>You mustn't tell anyone about me.</i>

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.940
<i>If you do tell anyone,
I'll know right away.</i>

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.990
<i>I'm always watching you.</i>

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.160
I can't tell you!

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.080
I can't tell you!

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.460
I can't tell you! I can't tell you!
I can't tell you!

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.670
<i>The smell of fear is strong.</i>

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.710
<i>He's trembling
all the way down to his bones!</i>

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.300
I can't tell you, all right?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.570
Once again, I failed
to get any information.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.080
Nezuko!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.960
She's asleep.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.170
She stopped bleeding, too.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.760
So, she's sleeping in order to recover?

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.180
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.930
Wait just a little longer, okay?

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.230
I promise to turn you
back into a human again!

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.090
Mr. Kazumi?

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:03.720
Are you all right?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.930
I've lost my fiancée.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.890
How can I be all right?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.690
Mr. Kazumi...

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.940
No matter how many people
you may lose,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.240
you have no choice but to go on living.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.580
No matter how devastating
the blows may be.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.080
What do you know about it?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.000
A kid like you?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.520
I'll be on my way now.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.020
Take this.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.780 line:20%
I hope you'll find something
of Miss Satoko's in there.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.140
<i>So, you went through the same thing, too?</i>

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.310
<i>Is that it?</i>

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:40.560
I...

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.230
I'm sorry!

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.020
That was an awful thing to say!

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.070
Please forgive me!

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.570
I'm so sorry!

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.450
<i>His hand was heart-breaking to see.</i>

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.080
<i>Hardened by relentless training
and so thick.</i>

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.840
<i>It wasn't a boy's hand.</i>

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.090
I'm leaving that young woman
in your hands!

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.970
All right!

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.890
All right!

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.860
<i>It's not just me.</i>

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.870 line:20%
<i>How many people have you killed,
tortured and tormented?</i>

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.250
<i>Muzan Kibutsuji,</i>

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.380
<i>I'll never forgive you as long as I live!</i>

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.560
Next up, Asakusa, Tokyo!

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.770
Rumors of a demon lurking there!

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.810
I'm heading to my next mission already?

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.940
Oh yes, you are!

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.030 line:20%
Hold on a minute.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.820 line:20%
No can do!

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.320 line:20%
Come on, just give me
a minute! Hold on! What?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.320
Just shut up and go already!

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.810
<i>Are the cities this advanced now?
It's nighttime, but it's so bright out!</i>

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.110
<i>The buildings are so tall!</i>

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.700
<i>What is this?</i>

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.200
<i>The cities...</i>

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.990
<i>The cities...</i>

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.090
I feel dizzy.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.930
Uh, let's go that way, Nezuko!

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.970
I-I beg your pardon!

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.490 position:80% line:50%
UDON

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.990
Excuse me.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.750 line:20%
A bowl of udon
with grated yam on top please.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.580 line:20%
Uh, sure thing!

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.590
I've never been to a place like this.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.720
It's way too crowded.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.980 line:20%
Here's your udon with grated yam on top!

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.110 line:20%
Thank you very much.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:48.980 line:20%
<i>This scent!</i>

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.690 line:20%
<i>Why would I catch it here all of a sudden?</i>

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.410
<i>It's the same scent
that was left in my house!</i>

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.330
<i>Muzan Kibutsuji!</i>

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.840 line:20%
<i>Is this the guy giving off that scent?</i>

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.980
<i>It's him!</i>

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.560
Daddy?

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.570
Who's that?

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.360
<i>He's...</i>

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.990 line:20%
It's all right.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.700
<i>He's...</i>

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.530 line:20%
Don't worry.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.950
<i>He's...</i>

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.950
<i>He's living here,
pretending to be a human!</i>

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.580
Is there something I can do for you?

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.130
You seem to be quite flustered.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.590
Oh my. What's going on?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.430
Mother!

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.140
<i>They're humans!</i>

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.020
<i>The girl and the woman...</i>

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.650
<i>Their scent is human!</i>

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.360
<i>Don't you know?</i>

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.530
<i>Can't you tell?</i>

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.320
<i>That this guy is a demon?</i>

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.120
<i>That he devours humans?</i>

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.250 line:20%
Do you know him?

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.250 line:20%
No.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.130 line:20%
Much to my consternation,

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.760
I've never seen this child before.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.600 line:20%
He must have mistaken me
for someone else.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.850
Oh, you think so?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.320 line:20%
Dear, what's the matter?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.490
Dear?

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.080
Stop!

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.360
I've finally tracked down Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.740
If I can bring him down,
then Nezuko can be human again!

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.990
Still, everyone in Asakusa
sure is stylish, huh?

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.000
I bet you'd look great
in an outfit like that!

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.000
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.380
Toyo from the udon shop
was born and raised in Asakusa.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:26.260
He makes udon in Asakusa
because he loves Asakusa so much, I hear.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.180
A suit, huh?

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.090
Now I feel kind of grown-up!

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.550
I'd better get back to my mission!

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.890
Next, Episode 8,
"The Smell of Enchanting Blood"!

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.020
TO BE CONTINUED
