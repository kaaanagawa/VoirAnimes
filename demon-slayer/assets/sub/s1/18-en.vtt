00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.650
Were you acquainted with any of them?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.240
There don't seem to be
any survivors around here.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.330
We were advised that several rookie
Mizunoto had joined the battle,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.630
but they might be dead by now,
don't you think?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.880
Let's go.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.220
Isn't the Moon lovely?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.470
Since we've been given this
joint mission, let's try to get along.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm only here to slay some demons.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.150
How callous of you!

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.440
All right, then, let's split up here.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.900
I shall proceed from the west.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.490
Agreed.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.540 line:20%
Don't come near my family!

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.130
Stay away!

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.130
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form!</i>

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.010
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.030
EPISODE 18:
A FORGED BOND

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.910
<i>It's no good!</i>

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.420
<i>The blade won't go through!</i>

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.470
So hard!

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.730
I can't slash him even if I use an attack!

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.900
What should I do?

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.190
What should I do?

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.690
Don't come near my family!

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.950
Stay away!

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.370 line:20%
What are you looking at?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.580 line:20%
I'm over here!

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.080 line:20%
Curse you!

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.260
Ouch!

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.430
All that force
with just one swipe of its arm!

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.760
It's no good! I'm not at full power!

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.850
Not to mention,
the bleeding's making me stumble!

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.230
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form...</i>

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.450
<i>Improved, Lateral Water Wheel!</i>

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.970
What was that?

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.890
What's going on?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.010
Inosuke! You okay?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.520
<i>He did that?</i>

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.020
<i>That was some move, dammit!</i>

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.360
<i>All right!</i>

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.030
<i>I should be able to chop off
that tough neck now!</i>

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.080
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.040
<i>The final and most powerful form!</i>

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.420
<i>He's got a different air about him now.</i>

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.010
<i>He's about to do
something totally mind-blowing!</i>

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.050
<i>Now I'll finish him off!</i>

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.010 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.720 line:20%
<i>Water Breathing...</i>

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.480
<i>Tenth Form!</i>

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.900
L-Look out!

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.570
Kentaro!

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.830
I-Inosuke!

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.830
Don't die until I get back!

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.210
That's one of the Twelve Kizuki!

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.420
Don't die!

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.830
Don't die!

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.800
Whatever you do, don't die!

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.020
Oh, crap!

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.620
<i>It's getting really hard to breathe now.</i>

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:43.420
<i>I have no feeling
in my arms and legs anymore.</i>

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.640
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.310
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.490
<i>Don't give up!</i>

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.450
<i>Don't give up!</i>

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.580
<i>Don't give up!</i>

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.660
<i>Don't...</i>

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.920 line:20%
<i>give up!</i>

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.070 line:20%
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.280 line:20%
Yoo-hoo!

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.320 line:20%
Are you all right?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.420
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form!</i>

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.420
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.390
I managed to land somehow!

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.640
I beg of you! Please stop!

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.010
What are you looking at?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.840
This isn't some show, you know.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.810
Wh-What are you doing?

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.430
Aren't you two allies?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.390
Allies?

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.190
Don't put us in the same category
as something that flimsy.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.440
We're family.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.280
We're joined by a powerful bond.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360
And besides,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.200
this is between me and my sister.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.120
So don't interfere.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.160 line:20%
Or I'll carve you up.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.500
You're wrong!

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.710
Whether it's your family or an ally,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960
if you have a strong bond between you,

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.220
then either one should be just as precious!

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.390
Calling it flimsy
if you're not related by blood...

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.180
That's not true at all!

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:46.190
Not only that, but those who have
a strong bond give off the scent of trust!

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.360
But all I'm picking up from you two
is the scent of terror, hatred and repulsion!

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.400
That's not what you call a bond!

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.950
It's counterfeit!

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.450
It's forged!

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.750
You...

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.000
Hey! Look at that,
a demon that's just the right size.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.760
Even I can take down
a kid demon like this one.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.930
Hold up a second please!

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.640
You can just back off!

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.640
I want to take the safe route
up the ladder.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.520
Since once you move up,
you get more money from the top guys.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.940
My unit's practically been wiped out,

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.490
but I'll slay myself a decent-sized demon
and head down the mountain.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.570
Take this!

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.530
Don't do it! Stop!

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.250
<i>Shattered to pieces in an instant!</i>

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.790
<i>But how did he...</i>

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.800
Hey, what did you say?

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:01.470
Look, you...

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.470
What was it that you just said?

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.060
<i>Just look at that intimidation factor!</i>

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.560
<i>The air just got heavy</i>

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.320
<i>and denser!</i>

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.900
<i>Inosuke,</i>

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.240
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.160
<i>Hang in there, okay?</i>

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.660
<i>Just a little longer!</i>

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.950
<i>I'll be there
as soon as I defeat this demon!</i>

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.250
<i>I'll come save you no matter what!</i>

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.210
Hey, you...

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.960
What you said just now...

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.960 line:20%
Let's hear you say it again.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.420
Come on.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.680
Say it, will you?

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.680 line:20%
Sure!

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.680 line:20%
I'll repeat it as many times as you want!

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.260 line:20%
Your bond is forged!

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.420
<i>O-Oh, crap!</i>

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.050
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.050
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640
<i>Dammit!</i>

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.100
<i>Hiding myself in a place like this...</i>

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.650
<i>How pathetic is that?</i>

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.730 line:20%
<i>Still, I gotta come up with a way.</i>

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.610 line:20%
<i>How do you slash someone
who's sword-proof?</i>

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.490 line:20%
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.200 line:20%
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.830 line:20%
<i>Just how do I slash it?</i>

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.500 line:20%
<i>Think! Think! Think! Think—</i>

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.040
Whoa!

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.000 line:20%
This is bad! This is really bad!

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.840 line:20%
Until...

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.970 line:20%
Until he gets back,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.760 line:20%
I gotta somehow...

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.020
What the hell kind of attitude is that?

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.270
Don't mess around, dammit!

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.940
Curse you!

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.070
Looks like I got infected
by Tontaro's germs!

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.040
Messing around like that...

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.250
That was way too close a call!

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.250
Using my head? That's so not me!

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.670
All right!

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.510
Slashed you!

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.300 line:20%
It's really simple.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.350 line:20%
If you can't slash something
with one sword,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.770 line:20%
all you gotta do is pound it
with another sword!

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.350 line:20%
I mean, look!

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.230
I have two swords!

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.440
I'm the almighty!

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.950
Are you running away on me?

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.200
Hey you!

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.200
Come back here, dammit!

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.930
I just want to let you know...

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.140
I won't kill you in one blow.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.100
After ripping you to shreds,
I'll carve you up.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.360
But...

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.400
If you take back
what you said just now,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.990
I'll do you a favor
and kill you at once.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.570
I won't take it back!

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.070
What I said was the truth!

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.160
You know who's not making any sense?

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.490
It's you!

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.130
You're the one who's mistaken!

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.270
Damn! That bastard...
Where the hell did he go, dammit?

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.650
I'm telling ya,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.360
this doesn't hurt!

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.870
What doesn't hurt doesn't hurt!

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.330
Now that it's come to this,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.960
I'll sniff it out for sure!

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.510
So, there you are!

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.600
You idiot piece of crap!
How high did you climb up?

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.930
Damn you!

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.690
So, you're plotting to make me
use my head again, huh?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.400
In your dreams!

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.530
What the...

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.860
Oh, I get it!

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.740
He's trembling with fear and dread
at the sight of me, huh?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.500
Well, it's a little too late for that!

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.000
What the...

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.340
Now what?

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.850
D-Did it just shed its skin?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.020
<i>Jeez.</i>

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.900
<i>Come on, that's bulking up way too much!</i>

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.900
<i>This is looking really bad for me!</i>

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.580
<i>I've never sensed this much force
from an opponent before!</i>

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.910
<i>I'll get crushed just by his force!</i>

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.710
<i>It's no good.</i>

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.670
<i>I can't win.</i>

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.760
<i>I'm gonna die.</i>

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.020
<i>I'm gonna be killed.</i>

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.230
