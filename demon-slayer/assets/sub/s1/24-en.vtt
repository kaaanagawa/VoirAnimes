WEBVTT

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.230
Are you heading into battle?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.440
Is that you, Kocho?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.910
We just got some new information
about a demon,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.740
and the Slayers who confronted him
got taken out.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.540
We're losing rank and filers, too, now.
We can't stand by and do nothing!

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.250
Could it be the Twelve Kizuki?

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.380
Most likely, yes. It might be
a member of the Upper Ranks.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.880
It sounds like a difficult mission,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.880
but as long as you're going, Rengoku,
there's nothing to worry about.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.510
Kocho, what's your plan
taking in that head-butting kid?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.020
You said you were going to add
more Tsuguko,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.140
but I'm sure that's not the reason.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.650
Don't worry, it's not as if
I'll gobble him up, all right?

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.060
Well, of course you wouldn't!

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.320
Be careful.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.000
EPISODE 24:
REHABILITATION TRAINING

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.000
Nooooo!

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.510
I can't possibly take any more!

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.630
We go through this every single day!

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.340
You're the most severely injured, Zenitsu!

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.510
Take your medicine this second!

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.600
Seriously!

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.150
Tanjiro, your medicine is right over there.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
Here you go.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.770
Thanks.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.530
Hey!

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.410 line:20%
Tanjiro's medicine goes down easy,
doesn't it? Right?

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.910 line:20%
It's different than mine, isn't it?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.910
I call favoritism! I call favoritism!

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.410
Zenitsu, this is a hospital ward!
Pipe down!

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.670
You seem to be doing well!

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.420 position:80%
DESTROY

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.130
Murata!

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.670
Hey!

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.800
Are you all right?

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.100
Well, I came this close to getting
melted away, but I made it somehow.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.810
But I hear you guys got really banged up.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.430
It looks like it's going to take some time.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.560 line:20%
And Wild Boar Kid,
in your case, was it the throat?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.730 line:20%
What's the matter with him?

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.820 line:20%
He went through a lot.
If you could please let him be...

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240 line:20%
But for this guy of all people
to be so listless—

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.450 line:20%
Tanjiro!

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.240
Who is that person?

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.750
He's Murata. He fought
with us on Mt. Natagumo.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.710
I'm Murata! Nice to meet you!

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.000
Hey, your arm...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
I almost got turned into a spider,
and my arms and legs are still short...

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.170
And that's why you need this medicine!

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.340
But it tastes so gross!

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.720
There's only so much gross
a person can take!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.600
Don't come crying to me
if your arms don't go back to normal!

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.180
So cold! That's such a cold thing to say!

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.100
You don't know how good you have it!

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.150
I mean, if you take this medicine and get
lots of sunlight, there'll be no lasting effects!

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.400
I can't do it!

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.740
Gross is gross! No two ways about it!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.280
Looks like fun. Lucky you.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.490
Murata?

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.170
I was summoned to the Hashira Meeting
to give my report on the Mt. Natagumo incident.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.250
And it was like hell!
Those Hashira are way too terrifying!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.800 line:20%
All pissed about how the quality
of the newer Slayers has gone downhill...

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.220 line:20%
Because there were some of us
who didn't follow orders on Mt. Natagumo.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.890 line:20%
And they were like, "Who trained them?"

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.610
What good would it do
to ask someone of my rank anyway?

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.400
Hashira terrify me!

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.780
Hello!

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.910
Hashira! Lady Kocho!

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.910
Hello!

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.910
Oh hello! Goodbye!

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.540
Oh my! Goodbye!

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.920
How is your recovery coming along?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.420
I think we're a lot better now.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.300
Then, let's have you start
your Rehabilitation Training, shall we?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.180 line:20%
Rehabilitation Training?

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.390
Yes!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.810
Forgive me for being weak.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.810 position:20% line:20%
TWO WEEKS LATER

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.480
<i>Tanjiro and Inosuke were taken away
by the Hashira, Lady Kocho,</i>

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.560 line:20%
MIRROR

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.560
<i>and started something
called "Rehabilitation Training."</i>

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.900
<i>Lady Shinobu's voice is totally unique.</i>

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.530
<i>I don't think I've ever heard
anything like it.</i>

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.570
<i>It lacks regularity,
and it scares me a little.</i>

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.410 line:20%
<i>But when she was treating the people
who got turned into spiders,</i>

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.120 line:20%
<i>she sure seemed like a goddess.</i>

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.830 line:20%
<i>No wonder everyone ran
to Lady Shinobu in tears.</i>

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.130 line:20%
<i>Not only that,
but she's unbelievably cute!</i>

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.840 line:20%
<i>I bet she could make a living
on her looks alone.</i>

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.800
So, this cute lady has taken Tanjiro and Inosuke
to Rehabilitation Training to rebuild their stamina.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.470
And any minute now...

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.020
<i>...they'll be back in this kind of state.</i>

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.150
Welcome back, Tanjiro, Inosuke!

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.530
How did it go today?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.740
What happened?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.360
What's the matter? Hey...

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.370
Sorry.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.120
Don't mind us.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.000
You gotta tell me about it!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.120
Because I'll be joining you
a little late starting tomorrow!

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.130
Nooooo!

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.960 position:20% line:20%
THE NEXT DAY

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.180
Scary! Scary! Scary!

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.720
I don't wanna go!

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.730 line:20%
CALM STATE OF MIND

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.020
All right, since you'll be joining us
from today, Zenitsu,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.730
I'll explain the process again now.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.310
You'll start over there.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.730
Those girls will make your bodies limber again
after having been bed-ridden for so long.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.990
Next, reflex training.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.780
These cups contain medicated water.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.620
The objective is to throw
that medicated water onto each other,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.960
but if your opponent blocks your cup
before you can pick it up,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.750
you can't move that cup.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.500
Now!

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.420 line:20%
Again!

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.970 line:20%
Now!

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.510
That's it!

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.260
Last up, full-body training.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.220
In simpler terms, you'll be playing tag.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.140
You'll be up against myself,
Aoi and Kanao over there.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.400
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.190
Is there something that's not clear to you?

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.990
No, it's just...

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.990
Come on, both of you.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:55.780
Not going.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.200 line:20%
Just shut up and come with me like I said!

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.710
Come on!

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.710
Come on, dammit!
You lowlifes! You dirtbags!

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.710
What the hell are you doing?

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.220
Sit up straight! I said sit up straight!

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.260
You miserable bastards!

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.890
What did you say?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.890
Inosuke!

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.400
What were you thinking, Zenitsu?
Tell Inosuke you're sorry!

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.070
You guys say you're sorry!
Apologize to me!

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.530
How dare you act like you'd come back
from Hell when you were in Heaven!

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.450
All you did was frolic with girls all day,
so why did you look so haggard?

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.290
Get down on your hands and knees
and apologize! Commit seppuku!

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.790 line:20%
How can you say such a thing?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.040 line:20%
Shut up, you goody-goody,
talking forehead!

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040 line:20%
Just shut up and listen, got that?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.300
You're allowed to touch girls!
You get to have your bodies massaged!

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.300
When you play that cup game,
you get to touch their hands!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.220
When you play tag, you get to touch
their whole freakin' bodies!

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.310
Each girl has two boobs,
one behind and two thighs!

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.480
They smell so nice when they pass by,
and it's mad fun just to look at them!

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.730 line:20%
Heaven! Sheer heaven!

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.900 line:20%
Cut the crap!
You're not making any sense!

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.740 line:20%
When you lose to someone smaller
than you, it destroys your soul!

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.410
Oh, poor you! Inosuke, you've never been
chummy with a girl before, right?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:24.250
Right, you were raised in the mountains!
No wonder you're a late bloomer!

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.000
I feel so sorry for you!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.370
Snap!

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.050 line:20%
Oh please, I've stomped
on female kids before!

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.510 line:20%
That's the worst thing you could do!

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.380
Not good, no good!
That's not gonna get you any girls!

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.840
I can get as many girls as I want!

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.100
Please train me well!

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.240 line:20%
It's all good! All good!

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.780
That guy has what it takes.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.120
I'm always fighting back tears
from the pain, but he's laughing.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.500
I shall take you on.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.250
Begin!

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.210
I would never splash tea on a girl.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.010
Now then, full-body training!

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.090
Begin!

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.930
I win!

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.930
I won the battle but lost the war!

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.940
I'm gonna kick some butt, too!

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.310
All right!

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.310 line:20%
All right!

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:31.310 line:20%
Ouch!

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.030
<i>I'm the only one
on a losing streak and soaked.</i>

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.610
<i>So embarrassing!</i>

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.200
<i>But...</i>

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.620
<i>I just can't beat Kanao.</i>

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.490
<i>None of us can get to her cup before her</i>

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.710
<i>or grab it away from her.</i>

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.710
<i>For the next five days,</i>

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.590
<i>I continued to lose to Kanao.</i>

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.710
<i>So did Inosuke...</i>

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.960
<i>and Zenitsu.</i>

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.470
<i>We couldn't so much as lay a finger
on a strand of her hair.</i>

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.310
<i>And then one day, the other two
stopped coming to the training room.</i>

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.230
Z-Zenitsu? Inosuke?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.610
Please train me!

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.610
Thank you for a good workout.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.530
<i>Why can't I beat her?</i>

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.240
<i>What gives her the edge over me?</i>

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.660
<i>First of all, her reflexes are way faster.</i>

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.790
<i>Even if I were 100 percent,
I'd probably lose to her.</i>

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.250
<i>Her scent is totally different.</i>

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.420
<i>It's similar to the scent of the Hashira.</i>

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.420 line:20%
Master Tanjiro?

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.140 line:20%
<i>Also... her eyes?
Her eyes are different!</i>

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:43.760
Master Tanjiro?

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.510 line:20%
<i>It seems.</i>

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:44.930
Um...

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.680
Master Tanjiro, are you all right?

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.310
We've been calling to you over and over.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.060
Sorry! I didn't hear you.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.310
What's up?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.820
Here's a towel for you.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.820
Thanks! That's a big help!

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.450
You're all so kind!

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.870
Um, Master Tanjiro,

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.580
do you maintain the Total Concentration
Breathing state around the clock?

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.000
Morning, noon and night. And all through
the night while you're asleep.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.420
Do you use the Total Concentration Breathing
technique nonstop?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.300
No, I don't. I've never done that.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.180
Is that even possible?

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:26.300
Yes!

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:31.430
We're told that being able to do that
makes all the difference in the world!

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.270
Even just using that technique
for a short time really takes it toll on me,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.070
but I should do it
around the clock, huh?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.110
Some people have already mastered it.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.990
All of the Hashira and Miss Kanao!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.200
Please work hard at it!

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.450
I see!

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.450
Thanks! I'll give it a try!

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.180
Isn't it about time
you came to training, Inosuke?

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.680 line:20%
Sulking and feeling sorry for yourself
won't do you any good.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.810 line:20%
Zenitsu, you should come, too!

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.810
Yes!

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.810
For me, that was a good job!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.190 line:20%
Just tell them my injury's taken
a turn for the worse!

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.980 line:20%
Hey, Kakushi lady over there!

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.070 line:20%
Would you like to have
some tea with me?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.160
<i>Total Concentration Breathing...</i>

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.330
<i>Morning, noon and night.</i>

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.250
<i>Even while I'm asleep. I said I'd try
to keep it up around the clock.</i>

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.380
<i>But I can't do it at all!</i>

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.090
<i>I can't do it!</i>

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:48.180
<i>If I try to do Total Concentration Breathing
longer, it makes me feel like I'm gonna die!</i>

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.800
<i>It's too painful!</i>

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.770
<i>My lungs hurt! My ears hurt!
My ears are ringing like crazy!</i>

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.180
<i>My eardrums!</i>

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.770
<i>That scared the heck out of me!</i>

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.030
<i>For a second there, I thought
my heart had burst through my ears!</i>

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.990
<i>I'll never make it at this rate!</i>

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.660
<i>When you're in trouble,
go back to basics!</i>

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.160
You spineless fool!

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.630
<i>Breathing is all about the lungs.</i>

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.550
<i>If I can't get the hang of it,
that means my lungs are too weak.</i>

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.090
<i>Work at it!</i>

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.300
<i>All I can do is work hard!</i>

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.260
<i>That's the story of my life!</i>

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.180
<i>Hard work is the sum of daily efforts!</i>

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.810
<i>It can be one step at a time!
Move forward!</i>

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.940
Right!

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.940
Master Tanjiro is working hard every day!

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.690
Yes! Let's bring him some rice balls, okay?

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.440
Good idea! And also...

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.200
Blow into these gourds?

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.740
That's right.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.160
Whenever she trained Lady Kanao,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.710
Lady Shinobu often had
her blow into gourds.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.250
Oh, really?

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.210
That's a neat training technique, huh?

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.210
So, you make some kind of sound?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.420
Oh no.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.840
She blew into it
to make the gourd explode.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.300
Oh, really?

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.340 line:20%
<i>Explode?</i>

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.350
What? You mean this?

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.140
Something this hard?

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.890
Yes!

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.060
Not to mention,
this is a special kind of gourd,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.730
so it's harder than normal ones.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.740
<i>A girl that petite was able to do that
to something that hard?</i>

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.740
The gourds get bigger and bigger
as you progress.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.740
The one that Lady Kanao
can explode right now...

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.250
is this gourd.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.870
Gigantic!

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.120 line:20%
I'll give it my all!

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.130 position:20% line:20%
THE NEXT DAY

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.130
They're not coming today, either?

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:46.590
I'm sorry.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.550
I'll bring them tomorrow.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.130
I'm sorry.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.760
No. You don't have to concern yourself
with those two anymore!

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.140
I'll work hard.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.640
I'll work hard!

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.850
<i>While throwing myself into the drills
that Mr. Urokodaki pounded into me,</i>

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:05.730
<i>I'm also maintaining
my Total Concentration Breathing state.</i>

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.730
<i>Imagining I'm running down a mountain,</i>

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:09.740
<i>I race all around the mansion's garden!</i>

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.280
<i>All of the obstacles are stand-ins
for the trees on that mountain!</i>

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.030
<i>Hard work!</i>

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.290
Hard work! Hard work!

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.750
Hard work!

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.750 position:20% line:20%
15 DAYS LATER

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.750
<i>I've regained most of my stamina.</i>

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.550
<i>And now, I can run
farther than I did before,</i>

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.510
<i>and my lungs are getting stronger!</i>

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.260
<i>I'm making good progress!</i>

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:34.550
<i>During the day, I run all over the place</i>

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.260
<i>and put my lungs into overdrive
with swift moves.</i>

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.100
<i>So now, I'll breathe slow.</i>

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.600
<i>I'll take slow, deep breaths</i>

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.770
<i>and send air all the way to my fingertips.</i>

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.650 line:20%
<i>Meditation boosts concentration.</i>

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.230 line:20%
<i>Mr. Urokodaki said so himself.</i>

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.860
<i>Mr. Urokodaki...</i>

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.280
<i>How dare you break my sword!</i>

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.370
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.790
<i>They're reforging my sword for me now,</i>

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.370
<i>but I'm really, really sorry.</i>

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.000
<i>Concentrate! You need to concentrate!</i>

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.340
<i>Concentrate on your breathing!</i>

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.510
Yoo-hoo!

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.130
Yoo-hoo!

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.630 line:20%
Yoo-hoo!

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.390 line:20%
Yoo-hoo!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.140 line:20%
Yes?

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.260
I can see you're working very hard.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.810 line:20%
Even though your friends
went off somewhere...

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.480
Don't you feel lonely all by yourself?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.200
No! Because once I've mastered it
myself, I can teach them, too!

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.740
You have a beautiful soul, don't you?

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.750
Um...

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.750
Why did you bring us all here?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.210
Nezuko's existence
has been officially acknowledged,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.720
and the three of you
were injured so seriously.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.720
And also,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.720 line:20%
I'd like to entrust my dream to you.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.140
Dream?

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.270
Yes.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.020 line:20%
My dream that we can
become friends with the demons.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:12.400 line:20%
I'm quite sure you can accomplish that!

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.530
Are you angry?

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.790 line:20%
For some reason, I'm always picking up
an angry scent from you

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.040 line:20%
even though you're always smiling.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.960
Yes.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.170
You're right.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.340
It might be true that
I'm in a constant state of anger.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.970
Ever since my beloved big sister
was slaughtered by a demon.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.520
Every time I see the tears of those
who've lost their loved ones to a demon,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.520
every time I hear those cries of despair,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.650
the anger keeps building up inside me

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.360
and continues to swell.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.410 line:20%
Deep down in the innermost
depths of my body,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.160 line:20%
there's a revulsion that I can't fight.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.250 line:20%
I'm sure the other Hashira
feel something similar, as well.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.250 line:20%
Well, this time,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.380 line:20%
they saw Nezuko, who's never devoured
a human, with their own eyes,

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.760 line:20%
and they've memorized her presence.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.340 line:20%
Out of respect for the Master's wishes,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.930 line:20%
I don't think anyone will raise
a hand to her.

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.560
My big sister was a kind-hearted
person like you.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.520
She had sympathy for demons.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.900
Even when she was on the brink of death,
she still felt pity for them.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.700
I couldn't bring myself to feel that way.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.160
How can you feel sorry
for something that's killed humans?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.710
I've never heard of anything so absurd.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.210
But if that was how my sister truly felt,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.340
then I must carry it on.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:00.380
If there's a way not to kill
these pitiful demons,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.680
I have to keep trying to come up with it.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:07.140
Without ever extinguishing the smile
that my sister said she loved...

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.060
<i>Sister!</i>

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.560 line:20%
<i>Sister!</i>

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.810 line:20%
<i>Sister!</i>

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.280
But now, I'm a bit exhausted.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.990
Demons do nothing but lie.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.240
Losing all reason
out of self-preservation,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.580
they murder humans
with their instincts laid totally bare.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.170
Tanjiro, please do all that you can.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.300
Please find a way
to protect Nezuko until the end.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:48.720
Knowing that you're working so hard
in my place reassures me to no end.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:50.930
I can rest easy now.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.820
Your Total Concentration Breathing
has come to a halt.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.780
I'll work hard at it!

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.540
<i>Total Concentration Breathing!</i>

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.960
<i>Mother, Hanako...</i>

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.960
<i>Takeo, Shigeru...</i>

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460
<i>Rokuta...</i>

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.340
I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human for sure!

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.860
Sniff, sniff! Lady Shinobu,
did something nice happen to you?

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.700
Yes! Because I've acquired
a precious drug.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.410
Sniff, sniff! Are you angry?

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.450
Someone keeps swiping the candy
from the shelves.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.200
Sniff, sniff!
You're also feeling sad, right?

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.660
There's a disturbance
in the mountain behind us.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.910
Now, time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.540
Since Aoi has been training
under Lady Shinobu,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.170
I hear she can concoct
the simpler medicines!

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.590
Nothing escapes your nose,
does it, Tanjiro? That's amazing!

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.130
Sniff, sniff! For some reason—

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.090
Because I enjoy talking with you, Tanjiro.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.930
Thank you so much!

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.560
Next, Episode 25,
"Tsuguko, Kanao Tsuyuri."

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.980
