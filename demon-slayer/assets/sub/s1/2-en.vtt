00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Excuse me.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.530
Would it be okay if I took
that basket, straw and some bamboo?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.950
Sure, you're welcome to it,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.740
but that basket's full of holes.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.530
Yes. I'll pay you for it.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.000
No, that's all right.
I mean, it's a basket with holes.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.960
Yes, I will pay you!

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.670
No, it's all right. You can have
the bamboo and straw for free, too.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.170
But I'm still paying you!

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.880
I said it's okay!
You're one stubborn kid!

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.890
Please accept this,
although it's just small change!

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.970
Thank you very much!

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.390
Ouch!

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520
Nezuko?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.020
Huh? Nezuko?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.570
She's gone!

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.030
There she is.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
EPISODE 2:
TRAINER SAKONJI UROKODAKI

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.880
Nezuko...

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.970
<i>She dug a hole?</i>

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.550
<i>My kid sister's turned into a mole.</i>

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.020
<i>And she's frowning!</i>

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.980
<i>She must really want
to avoid the sunlight.</i>

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.480
Wait there for a second!

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.530
Nezuko?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.030
Nezuko?

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.950
Think you can fit inside this?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.950
I want to keep moving
during the day, too.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.500
I'll carry you, okay?

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.250
Can you fit?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.420
In here?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.290
Basket.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.470 line:20%
She kinda protrudes, huh?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.810
<i>I can't believe she grew up.</i>

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.850
<i>Seems like yesterday that she was tiny.</i>

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.810
Nezuko?

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.770
Remember how you became big
like an adult earlier?

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.320
Do you think you can do
the opposite? Get smaller?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.360 line:20%
Smaller, Nezuko!

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.450 line:20%
Get smaller!

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.420
Good job!

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.130
That's a good girl, Nezuko!

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.670
I'm impressed!

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.090
Mt. Sagiri?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.810
If you want to go to Mt. Sagiri,
you'll have to cross over that mountain, but...

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.400
The sun's about to set. Are you really
heading there with all that luggage?

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.940
It's dangerous, you know.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.650
I'll be careful.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.900
Thank you very much.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.370
People have gone missing lately!

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.200
Try not to lose your way!

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.050
There's a temple over there.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.430
There's light leaking through,
so someone must be there.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.050
Let's check it out.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.970
I smell blood!

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.810 line:20%
This mountain path is pretty rough!
Someone must've gotten hurt!

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.360
Are you all right?

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.120
What the hell?

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.370
This is my turf.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.500
If you break into my territory,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.340
I'll make you pay!

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.340
<i>It's a man-eating demon!</i>

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.230
There's something off about you.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.780
Are you both humans?

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.670
A hatchet, huh? Not bad.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.130
But a scratch like this...

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.380
should heal in no time.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.220
See that? The bleeding's stopped already.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.160
<i>He's so fast!
And he's unbelievably strong!</i>

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.910
You won't get me twice!

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.330
All right.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.500
I'm gonna snap your neck!

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.280
<i>Sh-She killed him!</i>

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.900
<i>Oh, but wait! He's a demon, so...</i>

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.570
N-Nezuko...

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.870
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.460
<i>Did he just move without his head?!</i>

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.790
You bastards!

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.090
One of you is a demon after all?
You gave off such a weird vibe!

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.260
What's a human and a demon
doing teaming up?

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.180
<i>He's actually talking!</i>

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.560
Stop it!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.820
Nezuko!

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.920
Nezuko!

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.630
<i>What's the deal with this guy?</i>

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.970
<i>Growing arms from his head!</i>

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.340
<i>I gotta save Nezuko!</i>

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.600
Out of my way!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.310
<i>Hard as a rock!</i>

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.360 line:20%
<i>That head of his...</i>

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.570
<i>Like a rock!</i>

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.160
Okay!

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.210
I wrapped my hair around his hatchet
to grab it, but it got tangled up! Dammit!

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.670
Nezuko! Where are you?

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:04.980
Nezuko!

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.020
Stop it!

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.030
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.770
<i>I wonder if there are tons
of demons out there.</i>

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.020
<i>This isn't the scent
that was lingering in my house.</i>

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.560
<i>That was a different demon...</i>

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.110
<i>But...</i>

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.820
<i>I gotta finish him off...</i>

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.650
<i>or he'll attack more people!</i>

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.530
<i>So...</i>

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.370
<i>I gotta do it!</i>

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.290
<i>Do it!</i>

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.260
You can't finish him off with that.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.390
<i>A goblin mask!</i>

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.640
<i>I didn't hear his footsteps!</i>

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.900
H-How can I finish him off?

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.770
Don't ask me!

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.400
Can't you use your own head
to figure that out?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.030
<i>If stabbing's no good,</i>

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.450
<i>I'll have to crush his head!</i>

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.920
<i>To crush his skull
and smash it completely,</i>

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.300
<i>I guess I'm going to have to pound him
with this rock many times.</i>

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.640
<i>I bet he's going to suffer.</i>

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.930
<i>Isn't there anything I can use
to kill him with one blow?</i>

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.360
<i>This kid isn't going to cut it.</i>

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.110
<i>He's too kind and can't make decisions.</i>

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.120
<i>He's facing a demon,
yet the scent of kindness remains.</i>

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.200
<i>He has empathy for even a demon.</i>

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.210
<i>Giyu...</i>

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.460
<i>He's never going to make it.</i>

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.010
<i>I blacked out.</i>

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.720
<i>Is my body dead, then?</i>

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.390
<i>I feel sick!</i>

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.480
You bastard, I'll kill you!
I swear I'll devour you!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.270
Get over here! Dammit!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.570
I can't go to you, so you come to me!

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.860 line:20%
<i>I faltered too long.
Now the sun's coming up!</i>

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:57.980
Hey, are you listening, brat?

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.860
Hey, come here, you!

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.450
Are you listening, you brat?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.170
<i>He's gone with that much sunlight?!</i>

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.590
<i>No wonder Nezuko shrinks from it!</i>

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.970
Nezuko?

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.720
Nezuko?

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.030
Nezuko...

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.120
O-Oh, that's right.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.870
Where's that man?

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.130
<i>He buried the people who got killed.</i>

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.640
Um...

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.770
I'm Sakonji Urokodaki.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.650
I'm assuming you're the one
Giyu Tomioka sent my way.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.320
Yes! My name is Tanjiro Kamado!

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.530
My sister's name is Nezuko, and...

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.070
Tanjiro...

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.570
What will you do
when your sister devours a human?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.590
Too slow!

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.130
You're just too slow
at making decisions!

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.930
You failed to finish off that demon
before daybreak!

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:53.140
Do you know why you couldn't answer
my question right away?

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.020
It's because your resolve is too weak!

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.110
There are two things to do
if your sister devours a human.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.820
Kill your sister!

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.360
And slit your own belly and die!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.950
That's what it means to travel
with your sister who became a demon!

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.120
But that must never happen no matter what.
And you'd best not forget.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.460
Your sister, taking the life
of an innocent person...

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.590
That's the one thing
that must never happen. Ever!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.760
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.090
Yes!

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.590
All right, now I'm going to test you

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.720
to see if you're fit to become
a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.230
Carry your sister on your back
and follow me!

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.950
<i>He's so fast!
Just how old is he anyway?</i>

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.030
<i>And, like earlier,</i>

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.370
<i>I'm not hearing any footsteps at all!</i>

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.040
<i>Nezuko, I know it must be jarring,
but please be patient!</i>

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.040 line:20%
<i>Well, being patient
is all that you've ever known.</i>

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.510
<i>All your life...</i>

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.220
<i>You're fixing your kimono again?</i>

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.260
<i>I guess we'll have to buy you a new one.</i>

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.720
<i>No, no, it's all right!</i>

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.020
<i>This kimono's my favorite!</i>

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.900
<i>I'd rather the younger kids
got more food to fill them up!</i>

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.650
<i>I swear I'll turn you back into a human!</i>

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.660 line:20%
<i>I swear I'll buy you
a beautiful kimono someday!</i>

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.990 line:20%
<i>Everything that I couldn't do
for the others...</i>

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.160 line:20%
<i>I'll do it all for you!</i>

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.250
N-Now, have I...

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.380
passed the test?

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.930
The test starts now.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:01.940
We're going to climb a mountain.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.360
I'll make sure to take care
of your sister for you.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.320
I'm counting on you, sir.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.880
<i>I'm so exhausted.</i>

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.300
<i>My legs are starting to buckle!</i>

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.880
<i>I'm starting to feel dizzy, too.</i>

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.390
Now, from here, go back down to the house
at the foot of the mountain.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.270
This time, I'm not going to wait
until daybreak!

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.940
<i>Is that all?</i>

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.450
<i>I see.</i>

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.080
<i>He thinks I might get lost
in this thick fog.</i>

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.790
<i>I just have to get back
by daybreak, right?</i>

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.250
<i>That's easy!</i>

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.130
<i>I've got a great sense of smell!</i>

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.040
<i>I've already memorized
Mr. Urokodaki's scent!</i>

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.470
<i>Rocks?!</i>

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.860
<i>A pitfall?</i>

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.410
<i>I get it now.</i>

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.700 line:20%
<i>So, there are traps all around!</i>

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.950 line:20%
<i>That's the deal, huh?</i>

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.660
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.670
<i>Crap, crap, crap!</i>

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.840
<i>If I keep walking into traps like this,</i>

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:58.090
<i>I won't make it down the mountain
by morning!</i>

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.060
<i>And besides, this mountain...</i>

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:02.720
<i>This mountain is...</i>

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.680
<i>The air's thin here!</i>

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.360
<i>It's way thinner here than on the mountain
where I used to live!</i>

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.940
<i>That's why I'm gasping for air
like this and feel so dizzy!</i>

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.450
<i>Will I make it back?</i>

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.280
<i>I might pass out!</i>

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:19.870
<i>No!</i>

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.580
<i>I gotta make it back!</i>

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.450
<i>Get your breathing under control...</i>

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.040
<i>and sniff out each of those traps!</i>

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.360
<i>Right! I've got it! I've got it!</i>

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.860
<i>Traps set by human hands</i>

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.700 line:20%
<i>have a slightly different smell after all!</i>

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.370
<i>But that doesn't mean...</i>

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.250
<i>I'm suddenly athletic enough</i>

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.920
<i>to dodge every one of them!</i>

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.760
<i>I'm gonna make it back
no matter what!</i>

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.340
<i>Nezuko!</i>

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.130
I... have... returned.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.380
<i>Forgive my abruptness,
Mr. Sakonji Urokodaki.</i>

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.560
<i>I'm sending a boy your way who wants
to become a Demon Slayer swordsman.</i>

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.560
<i>He was brazen enough
to attack me unarmed.</i>

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.980
<i>His family was slaughtered by a demon,</i>

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.230
<i>and the surviving younger sister
has become one,</i>

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.700
<i>but I have determined
that she will not attack humans.</i>

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.290
<i>I can sense something different
about these two.</i>

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.000
<i>Like yourself, the boy seems
to have a keen sense of smell.</i>

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:40.050
<i>Perhaps he'll find a way to break through
and become your heir apparent.</i>

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.590
<i>I am asking you to train him.</i>

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.850
<i>I realize that this is
a self-serving request,</i>

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.020
<i>but please forgive me.</i>

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.690
<i>I hope that you will take good care
of yourself in your endeavors.</i>

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:00.440
<i>Yours truly...</i>

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.700
<i>Giyu Tomioka.</i>

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.920
I accept you as my student,

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.430
Tanjiro Kamado.

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.190
The demon in the temple surprised us
quite a bit, right?

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.740
I never expected
to see arms grow from his head.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.870
Now that I'm accepted
by Mr. Urokodaki, I'll do my best!

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.120
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.590
Mr. Urokodaki with the goblin mask...
Believe it or not, his age is—

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.380
Tanjiro!

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.130
Yes?

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:28.470
Which do you want for dinner?
Nikujaga or oden?

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.510
Huh? Well...

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:32.010
Too slow to decide!

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.550
I want oden!

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.430
Next, Episode 3, "Sabito and Makomo"!
