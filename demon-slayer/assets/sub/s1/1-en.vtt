00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.460
<i>How?</i>

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.210 line:20%
<i>How did this happen?</i>

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.140
Nezuko, don't die! Don't die on me!

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.560 line:20%
I'm gonna save you no matter what!

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.940
I won't let you die!

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.770
I swear your big brother will save you
no matter what!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.410
Tanjiro?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.790
Your face is covered in soot.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.880
Come over here.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.970
It's dangerous with all this snow.
You don't have to go, you know.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.180
Well, I want everyone
to eat their fill on New Year's,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.680
so I'm gonna sell
as much charcoal as I can.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.310
Thank you.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.940
Big Bro!

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.400
You're going to town again today?

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.320
I'm going with you!

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.320
Oh no, you're not.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200
You know you can't walk fast like Tanjiro.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.950
Mom!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.200
You may not.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.960
Since he can't use the cart today,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.040
he won't be able to give you
a ride when you're tired.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.050
Big Bro!

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.880
I wanna go with you!

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.640
I promise I'll help you!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.140
Thanks, Hanako.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.140
But you're staying home today.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.020
You, too, Shigeru.
But I'll get you tons of goodies, okay?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.110
Really?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.240
Yeah.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.910
And Hanako, I'll read for you
when I'm back.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.990
Okay!

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.490
That's a good girl.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.620
Thank you so much, Tanjiro.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.750
Sure.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.750
Okay, I'll be heading out now.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.120
Takeo...

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.340
Will you chop as much wood as you can?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.420
Sure, I'll do it, but...

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.800
I was hoping we could do it together.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.970
There, there.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.640
What's with that all of a sudden?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.350
You're blushing, Take!

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.730
Hey, you shut up!

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.020
There, there.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.060
I said cut it out!

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.280
Hurry back, okay?

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.490
Be safe, okay?

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.200
Big Brother!

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.330
Hey, Nezuko.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.460
I was putting Rokuta down for a nap,
or he'd make a scene when you leave.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.960
He misses Dad a lot
after he passed away.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.720
And everyone follows you
wherever you go.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.430
See you later!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.810
<i>We don't have an easy life,</i>

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.860
<i>but we're happy.</i>

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.110
<i>But life could change suddenly
like the weather.</i>

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.660
<i>It shifts and moves on.</i>

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.740
<i>It's not like it always stays sunny,</i>

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.750
<i>and it's not like it ever snows endlessly.</i>

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.960
<i>And...</i>

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.790
<i>whenever happiness is destroyed,</i>

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.250
<i>there's always...</i>

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.920
<i>the smell of blood.</i>

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.850
Well now, Tanjiro!

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.770
I can't believe you came down
from the mountain on a day like this.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.980
You're such a hard worker!

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.520
You might catch a cold, you know?

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.610
This is nothing, really.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.110
Do you have enough charcoal?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.530
Hey, Tanjiro!

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.990 line:20%
Can I have some charcoal?

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.080 line:20%
Thanks for fixing
my sliding doors the other day.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.950 line:20%
I'll need some charcoal, too!

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.250
Tanjiro!

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.300
Oh man, perfect timing!

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.090
I've been accused
of breaking this plate!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.800
Help me out, will you?

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.140
Sniff it!

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.390
I smell a cat.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.020
You see?

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.900
Oh my, so it was a cat?

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.270
I told you it wasn't me!

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.770
Tanjiro!

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.530
Can you give me a hand
with this luggage?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.870
Jeez, it's late already.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.160
I'm glad they're sold out, though.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.250
Hey, Tanjiro!

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.250
Are you gonna go back to the mountain?

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.420
You'd better not. It's too dangerous.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.550
I've got a great sense of smell,
so I'll be fine.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.680
I'll put you up for the night.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.890
Come on. Get back here.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.060
But...

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.810
Don't argue! Come on!

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.560 line:20%
Before the demons show up.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.490
Thanks for the meal!

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.750
Hey, Granddad Saburo,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.790
what are demons like?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.090
Man-eating demons have always prowled
the land once it gets dark.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.050
That's why you should
never stroll around at night.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.560
If you're done eating, go to bed.
You can set off for home at first light.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.030
These demons wouldn't come
inside your house, would they?

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.570
Yes, they'd come in.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.740
Then, everyone would get eaten up
by the demons.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.250
That's why the demon hunters
protect us by slaying them

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.040
since way back when.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.880
Lights out now.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.340
Go to sleep.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.680
<i>Old man Saburo is all alone
after losing his whole family.</i>

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.310
<i>So, he must be lonely.</i>

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.690
<i>I'll bring my brothers
and sisters next time,</i>

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.570
<i>and say, "You don't have to be scared.
There are no demons. You're safe."</i>

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.280
<i>But, come to think of it,</i>

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.910 line:20%
<i>my grandma used to say the same thing
when she was still alive.</i>

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.080
You be careful now.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.460
Okay!

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.680
<i>Whenever happiness is destroyed,</i>

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.470
<i>there's always...</i>

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.360
The smell of blood!

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.590
Nezuko!

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.010 line:20%
What happened? What's going on?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.130
What happened here?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.520
Mom...

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.650
Mom...

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.150
Hanako...

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.150
Takeo...

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.700
Shigeru...

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:36.700
Nezuko...

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.240
Rokuta...

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.840
<i>Nezuko's the only one who's still warm!</i>

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.460
<i>If I can get her to a doctor,
she might survive!</i>

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.180
<i>How did this happen?</i>

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.430 line:20%
<i>Was it a bear?</i>

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.060 line:20%
<i>Was it a bear that wasn't able to hibernate?</i>

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.110
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.030
<i>The air's so icy! My lungs hurt!</i>

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.360
<i>Keep moving forward!</i>

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.650
<i>Move your legs faster!</i>

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.740
<i>We still have a long way to go
before we reach town.</i>

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.990
<i>Hurry!</i>

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.120
<i>I won't let you die!</i>

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.080 line:20%
<i>I'm gonna save you no matter what!</i>

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.250 line:20%
<i>I swear your big brother will save you
no matter what!</i>

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.640
<i>Oh no!</i>

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.270
<i>I was saved by the snow.</i>

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:53.900
<i>I slipped because of the snow
to begin with.</i>

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.030
Nezuko?

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.580
Nezuko, are you all right?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.250
You don't have to walk!

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.580
I'll carry you to town, okay?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.670
Nezuko!

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.640
<i>Sh-She's...</i>

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:25.890 line:20%
<i>a demon!</i>

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.270
<i>I just remembered
what old man Saburo told me.</i>

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.770
<i>Nezuko's a man-eating demon?</i>

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.110
<i>No! Nezuko's a human
ever since she was born!</i>

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.450 line:20%
<i>However, she no longer has
Nezuko's scent.</i>

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.830
<i>But it wasn't Nezuko's doing!</i>

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.460
<i>She was lying
as if she was protecting Rokuta,</i>

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.380
<i>and there was no blood
on her mouth or hands.</i>

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.590
<i>And there was one more...</i>

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.710
<i>There was one more scent!</i>

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.680
Sh-She just grew in size!

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.930 line:20%
<i>And she's getting stronger and stronger!</i>

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.480
<i>While I was sleeping carelessly
at Saburo's house,</i>

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.270
<i>they were murdered brutally like that!</i>

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.190 line:20%
<i>I know it must've hurt.</i>

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.030 line:20%
<i>You suffered, didn't you?</i>

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.200
<i>I'm so sorry I couldn't save you.</i>

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.330
<i>If only I could help Nezuko at least!</i>

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.750
<i>But she's too strong
for me to push her back!</i>

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:30.540 line:20%
Nezuko!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.540 line:20%
Hang in there, Nezuko!

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.920 line:20%
Don't give in!

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.840 line:20%
You gotta hang in there!

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.800
Don't turn into a demon!

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.550
You gotta stay strong!

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.010
Hang in there!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.970
Hang in there!

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.670
<i>What the...</i>

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.180
<i>Who's that?</i>

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.520
DESTROY DEMONS

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.930 line:20%
<i>A sword?</i>

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.520
Why are you protecting it?

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.980
She's my sister!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.940
She's my younger sister!

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.020
Nezuko!

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.950
You call that thing your sister?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.880
Nezuko!

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.840
Don't move!

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.640
My job is to slay demons.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:12.850
Needless to say,
I'm going to decapitate your sister.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.600
Hold on!

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.770
Nezuko hasn't killed anyone!

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.030
Back at my house, there was another scent
that I'd never smelled before!

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.530
That's probably the one
who killed my family!

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.370
It wasn't Nezuko!

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.410
I don't know why she turned
into something like that, but...

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.580
but still...

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.460
It's quite simple.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.630
Because her wounds were exposed
to demon blood, she turned into a demon.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.670 line:20%
That's how man-eating demons multiply.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.510
Nezuko would never eat humans!

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.720
You gotta be kidding.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.310
Just now, you were about to be devoured.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.140
You're wrong!

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.100
I'm sure she knows who I am!

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.360
I won't let her hurt anyone!

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.770
I'm going to turn Nezuko
back into a human!

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.610
I swear I'll heal her!

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.860
She can't be healed.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.370
Once you become a demon,
you can never go back to being a human.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.990
I'll find a way no matter what!
So, please...

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.540
So, please don't kill her!

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.290
I'll hunt down the one
who slaughtered my family!

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.880
I'll make everything all right!

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.170
Please!

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.050
Please!

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.880 line:20%
Don't do it!

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.430 line:20%
<i>Don't take anyone else from me.</i>

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.390
I'm begging you not to!

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.180
Please!

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.270
Don't kill my little sister!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.770
Please don't do it!

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.400
I'm begging you...

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.540
Don't ever give others
a chance to murder you!

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.160
Stop that pathetic groveling!

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.750
If it was the least bit effective,
your family wouldn't be dead!

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.260
Can a weakling who can't take the initiative
in such a situation heal his sister?!

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.090
Hunt down the enemy?!

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.100
Don't make me laugh!

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.470
The weak have no rights or choices!

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.440
Their only fate is to be relentlessly
crushed by the strong!

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.150
The demons might know
how to cure your sister!

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.780
But don't think that a demon
would respect your will or wishes!

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.660
Naturally, I have no respect for you, either!

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.200
That's reality!

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.370
Why did you throw yourself
over your sister earlier?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.790
Was that your way of protecting her?

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.040
Why didn't you swing your hatchet?

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:44.170
Why did you show your back to me?

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.960
All those blunders led
to your sister's capture!

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.670
I could've skewered her along with you!

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.890
<i>Don't cry.</i>

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.680
<i>Don't despair.</i>

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.350
<i>Now's not the time for that.</i>

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.100
<i>I know you're devastated.</i>

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.650
<i>Your family was massacred,
and your sister's become a demon.</i>

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.980
<i>I know it's painful.</i>

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.280
<i>I know you want to scream.</i>

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.610
<i>I get it.</i>

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.780
<i>If only I'd gotten here a half-day sooner,</i>

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.830
<i>your family might not have ended up dead.</i>

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.290
<i>But there's no way to turn back time.</i>

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.130
<i>Feel the rage.</i>

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.380
<i>The powerful, pure rage
of not being able to forgive</i>

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.720
<i>will become your unswerving drive
to take action!</i>

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.260
<i>With such a fragile resolve like yours,</i>

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.510
<i>you can't protect your sister or heal her...</i>

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.600
<i>or get revenge for your family!</i>

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.480
No!

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.270
Stop!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.250
<i>A straightforward attack
driven solely by emotion...</i>

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.250
You fool!

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.640 line:20%
<i>Where's his hatchet?</i>

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.900
<i>Just before he hid behind the tree,</i>

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.410
<i>he hurled that rock toward me
and, at the same time,</i>

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.990
<i>tossed the hatchet in the air.</i>

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.410
<i>He hid his hands
as he pretended to attack</i>

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.410
<i>so I wouldn't realize he was unarmed.</i>

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.000
<i>He knew he couldn't beat me.</i>

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.670
<i>He tried to bring me down
after I struck him!</i>

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.430
<i>This kid...</i>

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.220
<i>Damn!</i>

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.640 line:20%
<i>She'll devour him!</i>

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.480 line:20%
<i>Nezuko...</i>

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.900 line:20%
<i>It wasn't Nezuko!</i>

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.910
<i>She'd never eat humans!</i>

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.790
<i>Long ago,</i>

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.830
<i>someone once said the same thing,
only to be devoured by a demon.</i>

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.840 line:20%
<i>When a demon is starving,</i>

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.840 line:20%
<i>it will kill and devour
even its own parents or siblings.</i>

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.340 line:20%
<i>Because they're nutrient-rich.</i>

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.300 line:20%
<i>I've seen it happen
more times than I can count.</i>

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.720
<i>This girl has been wounded,</i>

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.680
<i>and she's expending energy
to heal those injuries.</i>

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.230
<i>She must've drained vast amounts of her
strength as she transformed into a demon.</i>

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.440
<i>That means she's severely starved
at this moment, without a doubt.</i>

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.160 line:20%
<i>She must've wanted to feast on a human
right away, even if it's her own brother...</i>

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.240
<i>Yet, she protected him instead,</i>

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.620
<i>and she even intimidated me...</i>

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.370
<i>I wonder...</i>

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:11.420
<i>These siblings might be...</i>

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.750
<i>different from others.</i>

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.110 line:20%
I'm sorry to leave you behind, Tanjiro.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.610 line:20%
Take care of Nezuko for me, all right?

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.170
You awake?

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.670
Go see an old man named Sakonji Urokodaki
who lives at the foot of Mt. Sagiri.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.840
Tell him that Giyu Tomioka sent you.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.310
She seems to be all right
since it's cloudy now,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.810
but never let her be exposed
to the sunlight, okay?

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.040
Let's go.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.990
