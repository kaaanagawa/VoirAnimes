WEBVTT

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.560
That mask.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.350
I can tell by the fox masks.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.480 line:20%
Everyone got eaten just because
they were wearing them.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.080 line:20%
<i>Total Concentration!</i>

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.960
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.760
<i>First Form!</i>

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.520
<i>Water Surface Slash!</i>

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.990
EPISODE 5:
MY OWN STEEL

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.990
Urokodaki!

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.630
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.970 line:20%
My body's crumbling and disappearing.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.930 line:20%
I can't stop it!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.310
Dammit!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.440
To think that the face of a Demon Hunter
will be the last thing I'll ever see...

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.910
How did it come to this?

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.040
I'm so scared. I'm all alone.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.840
Brother, where are you?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.300 line:20%
I want you to hold my hand!

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.470 line:20%
Like you always do!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.720
Why?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.230
Why on earth did I bite you
to death, Big Brother?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.650
Huh?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.650
Wait, who's this "Brother" person?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.740
What a sad scent.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.720
God...

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.050
Please...

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.680
The next time this man is reborn,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.060
please make sure
he doesn't turn into a demon.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.570
Brother!

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.820
Brother! Brother!

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.030
Hold my hand, will you?

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.370
You're hopeless, you know?

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.040
Still such a scaredy-cat.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.440
<i>Sabito, Makomo...</i>

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.650
<i>and everyone else who were killed...</i>

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.820
<i>I won.</i>

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.400
<i>You can rest easy now.</i>

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.420
<i>I guess you're going home as promised.</i>

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.500
<i>Even though you're just souls,
you're going back to Mt. Sagiri...</i>

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.850
<i>...and to Mr. Urokodaki
whom you love very much.</i>

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.940
<i>If I'd ended up dead,</i>

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.360
<i>my soul would've returned there, too.</i>

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.290
There's something I wanna ask you!

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.840 line:20%
How do I turn someone who's become
a demon back into a human?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720
Please tell me!

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.230
How can I turn Nezuko...

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.190
back into a human?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.690
Wisteria?

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.190
I made it.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.830
<i>Only four of us?</i>

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.130
<i>But there were at least twenty.</i>

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.840
<i>I don't see that guy here, either.</i>

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.390
It's all because I blacked out
at that moment.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.180
I couldn't save him.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.930
I'm gonna die. I'm a goner.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.060
Even if I survive now,
I'm gonna die in the end anyway.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.940
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.530
Congratulations.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.580
We're pleased to see that you're safe.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.750
So? What am I supposed to do now?

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:26.710
Where's my sword?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.790
First, we shall issue you all uniforms.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:37.380
We will take your measurements,
after which your rank will be engraved.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.220
There are ten ranks in all...

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.600
Kinoe.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.640
Kinoto.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.640
Hinoe.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.640
Hinoto.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.600
Tsuchinoe.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.850
Tsuchinoto.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.850
Kanoe.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.900
Kanoto.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.110
Mizunoe...

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.860
...and Mizunoto.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:58.360
Currently, you are
at the lowest rank, Mizunoto.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.200
And our swords?

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:06.660
Today, we will let you
choose the ore for your swords.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.090
However, the swords will take
ten to fifteen days to complete.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.250
Are you kidding me?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.500
But first...

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:27.600
We will now assign each of you
your own Kasugai Crow.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.860
Kasugai Crow?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.990
These Kasugai Crows can be used
primarily for communication.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.110
Did you say "crow"?

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.030
Isn't this a sparrow, though?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.700
Don't give me that crap!

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.080
Who the hell cares
about some stupid crow?

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.800 line:20%
I want a sword, you hear?

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.130 line:20%
Gimme one right now!

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.300 line:20%
The Demon Slayers' sword!

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.470 line:20%
The Color Changing Sword!

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.560
Take your hand off her!

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.190
Or else I'll break your arm!

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.440
Who the hell are you?

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.200
Wh-Wh-Wh-What should I do?

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.320
Let's see you try it!

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.680
Are you finished chatting?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.730
Now then, please select an ore.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.490
The steel for the sword...

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.740
that will annihilate demons and protect you...

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.070
will be of your own choosing.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.620
Well, not that I'm going to live
very long. Probably.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.790 line:20%
<i>They're asking us to choose,</i>

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.550 line:20%
<i>but how are we supposed to pick one out?</i>

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.340
<i>I've never seen an ore before,</i>

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.390
<i>and I can't tell the difference anyway.</i>

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.680 line:20%
I have absolutely no clue.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.910
I see.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.670
As many as five of them
managed to survive, huh?

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.130
Excellent.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.180
The number of my children
has increased again.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.390
I wonder what kinds of swordsmen
they'll become.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.660
<i>I was so naive.</i>

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.670
<i>I couldn't even have a talk with a demon.</i>

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.840
<i>All they did was attack me
and try to kill me right away.</i>

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.670
Sorry, Nezuko.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.260
I never got to ask them...

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.970
how to turn a demon back into a human.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.820
<i>Even my uniform is heavy.</i>

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.900
<i>I wanna get home as soon as possible,</i>

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.280
<i>but my whole body hurts.</i>

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.060
I made it.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.520
Nezuko... Mr. Urokodaki...

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.990
Hey! Nezuko!

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.200
You...

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.120
So, you're awake?

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.290
Nezuko!

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.890
Why...

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.890
Why'd you fall asleep all of a sudden?

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.730
Never waking up once!

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.190
I was worried
you were going to die, you know?!

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.700 line:20%
You came back to us alive.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.260
I see. You killed that morphed demon.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.510
Yes.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.060
At last.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.770
I'm truly impressed
that you made it back.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:03.020
Yes.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.980
There are several kinds of demons.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.200
The demons who use a special spell
called the "Blood Demon Art"

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.030
possess supernatural abilities.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.040
You may have to fight
those demons, as well, from now on.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.540
And battling them will be far more difficult
than anything you've known until now.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:32.300
Even so, Tanjiro,
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800
Right.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.930
Um...

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.810
I think that Nezuko's not
like the other demons.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.350
Do you think it could it be
that Whatchamacallit Art?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.480
No, I don't think so.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.360
I wouldn't call that an example
of the Blood Demon Art.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.320
I'm just guessing here,

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.990
but it could be that Nezuko's recovering
her strength by sleeping

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.410
instead of consuming human flesh.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.750
<i>I'll protect you, Nezuko.</i>

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:23.560
15 DAYS LATER

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.160
Uh...

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.160
My name is Haganezuka.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.920
I have forged Tanjiro Kamado's sword,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.630
and I am here to deliver it.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.800
Um, I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.340
Please come inside.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.180
This is the Nichirin Sword.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.680
And I forged it.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:00.720
Um...

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.600
Please come in
so I can serve you some te—

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.310
The materials for a Nichirin Sword

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.560
can be obtained from the mountain
closest to the sun.

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.110
Scarlet Crimson Iron Sand
and Scarlet Crimson Ore.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.450
These produce steel
that can absorb sunlight.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.610
Wow, is that right?

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.660
Mt. Yoko is bathed in sunlight
all day long, you see.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.580
Never a cloud in the sky,
nor any rain.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.660 line:20%
There he goes again,

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.540
You're going to get dirty,
so could you get up for a second?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.000 line:20%
never listening to what others say...

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.210
A clown mask?

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.380
Hey, you're a Child of Brightness, aren't you?

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.890
Now that's what I call lucky.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.100
Oh no, I'm the son of Tanjuro and Kie.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.310
That's not what I meant.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.730 line:20%
See how your hair and eyes
are a reddish color?

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.530 line:20%
When a kid like you is born
into a family that works with fire,

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.490 line:20%
it's considered lucky
and a cause for celebration.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.820 line:20%
Is that right? I had no idea.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.410
There's a good chance
that this sword will turn red!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.450
Right, Urokodaki?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.040
Yeah.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.960
Come on, hurry up and draw it!

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.930
Nichirin Swords are also known
as "Color Changing Swords."

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.560
They change color
depending on the bearer.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.670
Black!

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.340
It's black, huh?

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.590
Is it bad or something
if it turns black?

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.630
Is it unlucky?

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.970
No, not necessarily.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.010
But you don't see
this pitch black too often.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.520
And I was so hoping
I'd get to see a bright red sword!

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.020
Dammit!

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.650
Ouch! Stop!

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.820
Please calm down!
How old do you think you are?!

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.660
I'm thirty-seven!

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.040
Tanjiro Kamado!

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.080
Here are your orders!

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.840
It talks!

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.340
