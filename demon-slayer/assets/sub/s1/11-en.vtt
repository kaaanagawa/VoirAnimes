00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.850
South-southeast!

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.560
Your next location is south-southeast!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.770
I heard you!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.650
I heard, so give me a break
and quiet down!

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.780
I'm begging you!

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.860
I got the message, so please!

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.160
Please!

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.540
Please! Please! Please!

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.160
Please marry me!

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.290
I could die any day, you know!

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.290
That's why I want you to marry me!

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.250
So please! Please, I'm begging you!

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.420
Wh-What's up with that?

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.470
What on earth?

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.800
Huh?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.990
EPISODE 11:
TSUZUMI MANSION

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.660
I'm begging you!

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.330
There's no one else!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.330
You're all that I have!

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.000
I see! Gotcha!

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.710
I'll do something about it!

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.340
Please help me! Please marry me!

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.050
I'm begging—

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.550
What do you think you're doing
right in the middle of the road?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.640
Can't you see she wants no part of you?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.140
And don't go making trouble
for your sparrow, either!

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.980
That uniform!

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.610
You're that guy from Final Selection!

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.860 line:20%
No one I know is anything like you!
I don't know you!

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.570 line:20%
But we met, remember? We met, remember?

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.110 line:20%
You're the one with the problem!
Like your memory!

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.420
All right, it's been taken care of.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.540
You can head home now
without any worries.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.960
I will. Thank you very much!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.920
Hey!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.010 line:20%
Stay out of my way!
That girl is going to marry me!

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.800 line:20%
Because she's in love with me, all ri—

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.850 line:20%
Hey! Ouch! That hurts!
Stop it! Stop it! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.600
H-Hey, calm down!

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.400
When did I ever tell you that I loved you?

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.740
You were crumpled up on the side of the road
looking ill, and all I did was speak to you!

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.870
You mean you didn't reach out to me
out of love because you were worried?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.080 line:20%
I already have a fiancé, so not on your life!

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.380 line:20%
With all that energy,
you must be fine now, right?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.750 line:20%
Goodbye!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.000
W-Wait, come back!

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.920
Come...

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.460
Look, cut it out!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.260
Wh-Why'd you get in my way?
This has nothing to do with you!

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.180
What's with that look on your face?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.350
Stop that!

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.430
Why are you staring at me
like I'm a creature or something?

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.400
Hey you! You're responsible for it!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.940
Since it's your fault
that I missed out on getting married!

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.280 line:20%
Jeez, say something!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.870
Listen up! I'm going to die soon!

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.530
During my next job!

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.250
The thing is, I'm horribly weak, okay?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.660
I'm not kidding!

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.710
You gotta protect me
until I manage to get married, all right?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.500
My name is Tanjiro Kamado!

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.130
Is that right? My apologies!

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.130
I'm Zenitsu Agatsuma!
Please save me, Tanjiro!

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.260
What do you mean, save you?

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.680
What was your reason
for becoming a swordsman, Zenitsu?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.850
Why are you being
so blatantly shameless?

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.270
That's a harsh way to put it!

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.350
I got swindled by a woman
and racked up all this debt!

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.270
The old geezer who took it over
for me was a cultivator!

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.610
Day after day, I had to go
through hellish training!

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.950
It was so bad that I thought
I'd be better off dead!

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.660
I was hoping I could die
during Final Selection!

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.330
But since I was lucky enough to survive,
I'm still going through hell every day!

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.330
I'm so scared! Scared! Scared! Scared!

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.330
I just know that I'm gonna get devoured
and killed soon by a demon!

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.790
My brains are gonna get sucked
through my ears while I'm still alive!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.090
No! No!

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.550
Please save me!

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.720
What's the matter?

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.050
Are you okay?

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280
How are you?

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.370
Yeah.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.990
Now that I'm calmer,
I'm getting hungry.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.960
Don't you have any food on you?

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.370
Nope.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.630
Here, take this.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.960
Would like to eat it?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.380
Hey, thanks.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.100
You're not eating, Tanjiro?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.770
No, since that's all I've got.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.280
Here.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.780
You eat half.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.450
You sure?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.780
Thanks!

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.590
I know what you mean
when you say you're scared of demons,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.140
but you can't make trouble
for your sparrow.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.180
Was it distressed? The sparrow?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.770
How can you tell?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.270 line:20%
Well, he says that you're always whining
about not wanting to go to work,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.150 line:20%
and you're always hitting on girls,
and that you snore so loud, he's had it!

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.650
So he says.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.530
He's saying that?

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.860
You can understand bird language?

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.990
You're lying, right?
You're just trying to trick me!

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.950
Start running! Start running!

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.790
Tanjiro, Zenitsu, run!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.590
Both of you head over
to your next destination!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.840
Run! Run, Tanjiro, Zenitsu!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.300
That crow is talking!

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.400
Hey, Tanjiro,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.900
on second thought,
I'm not gonna make it.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.990
Even if I go along,
I'm gonna be totally useless.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.530 line:20%
<i>The demon scent
is getting stronger little by little.</i>

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.410 line:20%
<i>There's something up ahead.</i>

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.370
<i>What's that?</i>

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.380
I can smell blood.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.260
But this particular scent...

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.930
You smell something?

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.890
Something I've never smelled before.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.690
I don't know about that,
but do you hear that sound?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.520
Also, are you and I gonna work
together, after all?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.820
Sound?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.490
K-Kids...

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:38.910
I wonder what's wrong.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.620
Hey, guys, what are you doing here?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.590
<i>They seem really spooked.</i>

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.930
Okay, wanna see something cool?

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.720
Ta-da!

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.520
It's a tame sparrow!

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.480
See? Isn't he cute?

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.910
Please tell me.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.780
Did something happen?

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.700
Is this your house?

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.750
No. No, it's not.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.790
This...

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.000
This is...

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.210
A-A monster's...

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.710
house!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.010
Our big brother got taken away.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.300
When we were walking
down the road at night,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.010
this monster we'd never
seen before showed up.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.180
It didn't give us a glance.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.970
Just our brother.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.020
And they went inside that house, right?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.100
Yeah.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.100
Yeah.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.650
Did you two follow them here?

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.780
You did good!

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.280
Great job!

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.280
We followed the traces of his blood.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.280
Because he got hurt!

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.490 line:20%
<i>Hurt...</i>

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.700
Don't worry!

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:08.000
We're going to defeat the bad guy
and rescue your brother!

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.880 line:20%
Really? You really will?

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.000 line:20%
Yeah.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.380 line:20%
For sure!

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.670
Tanjiro...

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.880
Hey, what is this sound?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.300
This creepy sound never stops.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.720
Is it a tsuzumi?

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.930
Sound?

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.140
I don't hear any.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.840
Don't look!

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.340
Are you all right?

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:04.600
Are you all right?

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.220
Stay with me!

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.020 line:20%
<i>The wound is so deep.</i>

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.690 line:20%
<i>Is this...</i>

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.730
Even though... I got out...

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.950
Even though I made it out...

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.950
Made it outside.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.330
Still...

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.080
Am I gonna die?

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.580
Am I still gonna die?

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.730 line:20%
<i>And now he's gone...</i>

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.900 line:20%
<i>It must've hurt a lot.</i>

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.560 line:20%
<i>You must've suffered.</i>

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.990
Tanjiro, by any chance,
is that guy these kids'...

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.270
<i>We couldn't save him.</i>

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.440 line:20%
<i>If only we'd gotten here a little sooner,</i>

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.900 line:20%
<i>we might've managed to save him.</i>

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.270
Hey,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.070
is this man your...

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.700
I-It's not Brother.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.080
Brother's wearing
a persimmon-colored kimono.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.120
<i>I see.</i>

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.370
<i>So it's captured more than one person.</i>

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.750
<i>I promise to bury you when I return.</i>

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:59.550
<i>Forgive me.</i>

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.010
<i>Forgive me.</i>

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.880
All right.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.090
Zenitsu, come on!

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.640
But no one else can help them now
but you and me.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.980 line:20%
Really?

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.650 line:20%
All right, then.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.370
Hey, come on! Why are you making
that ogre face at me?

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.660
Okay, I'll go!

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.210 line:20%
I have no intention of forcing you to.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.920
I said I'll go!

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.130
In case of an emergency,
I'm leaving this box behind.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.340
Even if something happens,
you two will be protected.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.010
Okay, we're going now.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.840
Tanjiro!

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.380
Hey, Tanjiro!

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.390
You'll protect me, right?
You'll protect me, right?

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.390
Zenitsu, I hate to put you
on the spot, but...

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.400
I've got a broken rib and leg
from my previous battle.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.900
And neither are fully healed yet. So—

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.240 line:20%
What do you mean, broken bones?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.910 line:20%
Don't go breaking any bones on me!

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.160
If you've got fractures,
you can't possibly protect me!

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.410
I-I-I'm gonna die!

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.660
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:58.790
I'm gonna die now!

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.330
Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die!

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.800
Broken bones? How could you?
I'm a dead man now! 99.9% dead!

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.300 line:20%
I'm dead! I'm dead! I'm dead!

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.090
Zenitsu, quiet down!

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.300
You'll be all right!

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.510 line:20%
Don't sugarcoat it!

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.180
I'm not! I can tell, all right?
Zenitsu, you're—

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.560 line:20%
No good!

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:20.730
You shouldn't be here!

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.980
M-Mister, we heard scratching sounds
from inside that box!

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.490
E-Even still, it pains me
that you left it behind!

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.740
I mean, it's more precious
to me than my own life!

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.830
Sorry! My butt...

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.350 line:20%
<i>It's a different room.</i>

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:56.600 line:20%
<i>No.</i>

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.600 line:20%
<i>Were we the ones that moved?</i>

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.640 line:20%
<i>To the beat of that tsuzumi?</i>

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.110
Sorry you got separated
from your brother, okay?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.240
But I'm gonna protect you
no matter what.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.490
And Zenitsu is gonna protect your brother.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.820
Don't worry!

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.620
What's your name?

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.620
Teruko.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.120
Is that right? Teruko?
That's a fine name you have—

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.220
<i>Even among all these scents,</i>

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.060
<i>this is the strongest one
that this house is steeped in!</i>

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.310
<i>This one's devoured
a whole slew of humans!</i>

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.150
<i>This one's the master of this house!</i>

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.980
I'm gonna die!

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.280
Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die,
I'm telling you!

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.740
Tanjiro and I got split up!

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.240
Teruko!

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.580
Teruko!

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.490
No, no, no, no!

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.200
Don't yell like that!

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.710
If you yell and the bad guy hears you,
it won't be pretty!

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.210
Come on, let's step outside!

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.210
What...

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.840
Why outside?

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.710
Are you trying to escape all by yourself?

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:15.930
All this constant yammering about dying...
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.810
Clinging onto a younger person...
Don't you feel pathetic?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.430
What are you wearing that sword
on your hip for anyway?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.860
Those words cut so deep.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.530
That's not it!

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.950
I'm not gonna be of any use anyway,

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:34.950 line:20%
Let me go!

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.320
so I'm gonna summon
a grownup here, okay?

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.320 line:20%
Let me go!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.330 line:20%
Because this isn't something
us kids can resolve on our own!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.000 line:20%
You're kidding me, kidding me, kidding me!

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.170 line:20%
I'm sure this was the front door!

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.840
Where'd the outside go?
I mean, this door was...

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.590
Is it this one?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.180
How about this one?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.840
What about this one?

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.530
It's a monster!

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.040
What the heck?
What's that look in your eyes?

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.710
Stop looking at me like that!

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.140
If it hadn't been...

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.060
If it hadn't been for their meddling...

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.310
Teruko, you gotta try not to scream.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.270
The room's going to flip around,
so don't go into the hall.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.480
Step back and hide behind the shelves.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.620
Curses, curses!

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.450
Thanks to them, he got away!

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.330
When he was my prey!

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:15.840
Why is it? Why do they all keep
barging into someone else's home?

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.550
It's infuriating.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.720
That was my prey!

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.100
My own prey, discovered on my own turf!

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.400 line:20%
Curse them!

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.520 line:20%
Curse them!

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.070
Hey! Listen!

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.030
I'm with the Demon Slayers Corp.
Rank 10, Tanjiro Kamado!

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.530
I'm going to slay you now!

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.540 line:20%
A child with rare blood
that I found myself!

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.170
<i>Got him!</i>

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.380
Teruko!

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.600
<i>Now the tatami floors are on the sides!</i>

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.600
<i>The room's been flipped!</i>

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.520
<i>So, this is that demon's Blood Demon Art!</i>

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.650
<i>This entire house is this demon's territory!</i>

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.980
<i>What's this?</i>

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.980
<i>An odd scent is wafting this way.</i>

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.780
<i>It's not a demon!</i>

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.780
Comin' through! Comin' through!

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.540
Comin' through!

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.750
<i>Wh-Who's that guy?</i>

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.050
<i>He's wearing a boar's hide!</i>

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.970
<i>And he's wielding Nichirin Swords!</i>

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.140
All right, you monster...

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.270
Die on the battlefield
and serve as my springboard!

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:58.520
So that I can become more powerful
and soar even higher!

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.650
Infuriating!

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.530
Infuriating!

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.990
Here goes...

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.160
Comin'...

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.540 line:20%

RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:44.630
Hey, Tanjiro,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.430
I think that girl you forcibly pulled
away from me loves me after all.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.890
What are you talking about?

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.060
It was so obvious
that she wasn't into you!

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.220
That's not true!
She might've said all those things,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.520
but she could've really wanted me
to chase after her, right?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.690
I think there was love in her eyes
when she slapped me,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.270
and then all the other times she hit me,

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.650
she was really putting her heart
into it every single time!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.610
She must be in love with me
for sure, for sure, for sure!

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.070
Say something, will you?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.370
Now, it's time for a Taisho secret!

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.540
I hear that Zenitsu gets self-conscious
in front girls, and his heart starts fluttering.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.960
Well, I can't help it!

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:22.960
Girls are so adorable,
so soft, and they smell so nice!

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.800
Oh, man, now that I'm thinking about them,
I just remembered that girl!

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.970
If I make it out of this house,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.430
I'm gonna go right after her
and rub my cheek against her!

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.430
Next, Episode 12,
"The Boar Bares Its Fangs, Zenitsu Sleeps."

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.220
Hey, don't just ignore me, Tanjiro!
