WEBVTT

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.770
Holy -

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.230
Look at them go!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.030
That's it!

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.120
You sure are fast, Kanao!

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.250
Your record is now
ten wins and ten losses.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm totally not done yet.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.880
Let's go for a run. Are you up to it?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.670
You mean while doing
Total Concentration, Constant?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.880
Yeah.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.100
Keep this up the whole time?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.220
Monjiro!

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.510
Take this!

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.020
That's nothin'!

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.060
You're all brawn and no brains!

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.310
Let's go!

EPISODE 26:
NEW MISSION

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.240
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.870
LOWER SIX

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660
<i>Where the hell is this place?</i>

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.670 position:80% line:20%
LOWER ONE

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.300 line:20%
LOWER TWO

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.430
<i>Was it that woman's Blood Demon Art?</i>

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.890
<i>Looks like the whole space
is distorted around that woman.</i>

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.410 position:20% line:20%
LOWER THREE

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.000
<i>Only the Lower Ranks
of the Twelve Kizuki have been summoned.</i>

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.000 position:80% line:50%
LOWER FOUR

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.840
<i>That's never happened before.</i>

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.590
<i>Lower Five isn't here yet.</i>

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.930
<i>It just moved!</i>

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510
<i>Blood Demon Art again?</i>

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.520
<i>What's the deal with this woman?</i>

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.900
<i>Who is she?</i>

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.440
Lower your heads and crouch down.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.950
Prostrate yourselves.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.000
<i>It's Master Muzan!</i>

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.670
<i>That's Master Muzan's voice!
I didn't recognize him!</i>

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.250
<i>He's changed his appearance and aura.</i>

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.300
<i>The precision of his shape-shifting
is mind-blowing!</i>

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.590
P-Please forgive us!

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680
Since you've assumed
a different form and aura...

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.060
Who gave you permission to speak?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.680
Don't presume to voice
your worthless thoughts.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.100
Answer my questions. Nothing else.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.030
Rui was killed.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.400
I'm talking about Lower Five.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.320
I have but one question to ask of you.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.580
Why is it that you demons
in the Lower Ranks are so utterly weak?

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.460
You shouldn't be satisfied with just
being counted among the Twelve Kizuki.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.750
That is merely your starting point.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.460
To devour more humans,
to gain more power...

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.670
Your starting point
for becoming useful to me...

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.300
For over a century,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.220
the members of the Upper Rank
Twelve Kizuki remain unchanged.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.350
It's always been the demons
in the Upper Ranks

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.900
who've disposed
of those Hashira demon hunters.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.980
But what about you demons
in the Lower Ranks?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.820
How many times have you been replaced?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.740 line:20%
<i>That's easy for you to say, but we...</i>

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.110 line:20%
"That's easy for you to say, but we..."

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.620 line:20%
What? Go ahead and say it.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.990 line:20%
<i>He can read my mind?</i>

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.790
<i>I'm screwed!</i>

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.670
Screwed how?

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.880
Go ahead and say it.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.840
Please forgive me, Master Kibutsuji!

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.340
Please!

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.630
Please show me mercy!

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.430
I'm truly sorry! I'm truly sorry!

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.640
I'm truly—

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.110
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.520
<i>Am I going to be killed?</i>

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.650
<i>After all I went through
to become a Twelve Kizuki...</i>

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.990
<i>Why? Why?</i>

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.530
<i>I thought I was going to do
more and more!</i>

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.750
Are you more afraid of the demon hunters
than you are of me?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.370
No!

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.460 line:20%
Every time you run into a demon hunter Hashira,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.550 line:20%
the only thing on your mind is escape.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.800
Oh no, that's not what I'm thinking!

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.590
I'll put my own life on the line
to fight for you!

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.600
Are you refuting what I just said?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.980 line:20%
<i>No good! It's over!</i>

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.110 line:20%
<i>Our minds are being read.</i>

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.820 line:20%
<i>Whether we agree or disagree with him,
he's still going to kill us!</i>

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.660
<i>We can't possibly beat him in battle, either!</i>

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120
<i>In that case...</i>

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.330
<i>...the only option is to run!</i>

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.050
<i>What a fool.</i>

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.300
<i>Just make it out of here somehow!
Somehow!</i>

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.890 line:20%
<i>Now that I've gotten this far away...</i>

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.390 line:20%
I believe that the Twelve Kizuki are better off
consisting of just the Upper Ranks.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.730 line:20%
I am now dismantling the Lower Ranks.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.900 line:20%
<i>He got me?</i>

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.320 line:20%
<i>No way!</i>

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.700
<i>Was it that Biwa Player's technique?
But no, I didn't hear any biwa sounds.</i>

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.240 line:20%
<i>Why?</i>

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.870 line:20%
<i>I can't regenerate my body.</i>

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.220 line:20%
Do you have any last words?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.890
I can still be of use to you!

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.690
If you could give me just a short reprieve,
I swear I'll be of use to you!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.730
How long a reprieve
are you asking for, specifically?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.690
How do you intend to be useful?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.070
What exactly can you accomplish
with your current skills?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.450
Your blood!

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.200
If you could give me
a share of your blood,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.210
I will acclimate without fail!

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.000
I will fight for you
as an even more powerful demon!

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.880
What makes you think you can order me
to give you my blood?

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.340
You're beyond shameless.
Remember who you are.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.100
You misunderstood me!
You misunderstood me!

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.140
I just...

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.600
Shut up. I misunderstood nothing.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.140
I'm never mistaken about anything.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.980
I'm the one who calls all the shots.
My word is absolute.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.990
You have no right to reject what I say.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.240
Whatever I say is right
is the right thing.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.120 line:20%
You tried to tell me what to do.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.620 line:20%
You deserve to die.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.710 line:20%
Do you have any last words?

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.180
<i>He'll end up killed, too.</i>

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.510
<i>Everything hinges on the Master's mood.</i>

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.270
<i>I'll be dead soon myself.</i>

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.190
Well, let's see...

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.280
This is like a dream for me.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.200
To die by your hand in person.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.530
And I so enjoyed hearing
the other demons' last gasps!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.830
I feel so blessed!

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.630 line:20%
Because I love to see others
in despair and agony.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.550 line:20%
Because it's like a dream come true for me!

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.840 line:20%
I thank you for leaving me for last!

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.480 line:20%
That's what I like to hear.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.280 line:20%
I'm going to give you
an ample share of my blood.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:37.530 line:20%
Although you might not be able
to withstand the volume of blood, and die.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.490
Still, if you do manage to acclimate,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.330
you're sure to acquire
even greater strength.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.670
Make yourself useful to me, then.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.460
Kill the demon hunter Hashira!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.630
If you can kill the demon hunter
wearing hanafuda-like earrings,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.970
I'll give you even more of my blood.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.240 line:20%
<i>What's this?</i>

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.080 line:20%
<i>I see something!</i>

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.830 line:20%
<i>It's gushing into me
along with Master Muzan's blood!</i>

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.590
If I kill the Hashira and this kid,
I can get more blood!

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.720
It's like a dream!

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.480
It's morning! Wake up!

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.310
What the heck?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.480
What's going on?

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.480
The casualties of the Infinite Train
are increasing.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.900
More than 40 are now missing.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.490
You are to join Kyojuro Rengoku on site.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.990
Head west at once!

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.510
I have decided to send Tanjiro and the others
on the Infinite Train mission.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.600
Shinobu, may I ask
what made you recommend Tanjiro?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:27.060
Tanjiro has a pure soul and is capable
of striving hard on a daily basis.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:31.020
And the upside that he showed
exceeded my expectations.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.950
And above all else, he has a clear goal
in mind. To defeat Kibutsuji.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.780
As far as that goes,
I'm in agreement with you.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.910 line:20%
Also, Tanjiro himself told me that his father
had used the Fire Breathing technique.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.670 line:20%
Ah...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.090
At this time, there's no denying
that he still has a way to go,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:00.510
but perhaps Rengoku, the Flame Pillar,
might be able to provide some guidance.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.140
Yes. Considering his sister, who won't devour
humans even after becoming a demon,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.940
as well as his encounter with Kibutsuji,

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.070
it might very well be Tanjiro's destiny.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.740
All right, time to go!

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.120
<i>Someone's coming.</i>

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.330
<i>He bumped into me
even though I got out of the way.</i>

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.880
<i>Huh? That guy just now...</i>

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.630
<i>Was he at Final Selection?</i>

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.010
<i>He got such an amazing build
in such a short time.</i>

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.640
<i>But I wonder why...</i>

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:45.930
<i>His scent...</i>

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.730
Long time no see!
Glad to see you're doing well!

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:55.480
Is that right?

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.020
You're heading out now?

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.360
It was only for a short time, but I'm glad
we got to spend that time together.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.240
Good luck to you!

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.240
Take care!

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:10.040
Thank you so much for looking out
for us when you were so busy!

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.250
Thanks to you,
we can go back into battle!

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.670
No need to thank me.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.300
After all, I survived
Final Selection only by luck.

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.140
And then, I was too afraid
to go into battle. I'm a coward.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.220
Hey, that doesn't matter.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.810
Since you helped me out, Miss Aoi,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.810
you're part of me now.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.650
And I'm carrying all of your emotions
onto the battlefield with me!

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.740
All right! Look after me
if I get hurt again, okay?

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.500
Hey! There you are!

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.880
Kanao!

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.920
We're heading out now.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.500
Thanks for everything!

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.760
Hey! What's that?

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:14.310
TAILS

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.360
All I did was follow the Master's orders.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.650
There's no need for you to thank me.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.490
Farewell.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.860
<i>Hey, you talked to me!</i>

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.450
What was that you just flipped?

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.990
Farewell.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.830
Money?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.210
It says "Heads" and "Tails," huh?
Why did you flip it?

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.330
Farewell.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.370
You really made it twirl around!

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.300
I flip this to decide
what I haven't been ordered to do.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.720
I just decided
whether or not to speak to you.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.180
"Don't speak" was heads,
and "Speak" was tails.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.470
Because it came up tails, I spoke to you.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:52.890
Farewell.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.770
Why don't you decide for yourself?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.270
What did you want to do, Kanao?

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.900
It doesn't matter.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.730
Nothing matters to me,
so I can't decide for myself.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.280
I don't think there's anything
in this world that doesn't matter.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.780 line:20%
I guess...

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.790
the voice in your heart is really tiny.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.750
Sure, following orders is important, but...

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.800
Hey, can I borrow that for a second?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.550
Yes.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.220
Thanks!

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.180
Okay! Let's toss this to decide!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.180
Decide what?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.640
Whether or not...

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.940
you're going to listen hard to the voice
in your own heart from now on!

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.900
I flipped it too high!

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.150
Heads! Let's make it heads!

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.030
If it comes up heads, Kanao,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.030
you're going to follow your heart!

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.910
Huh? Where did it go?

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.040
Oh, is that it?

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.880
Got it! Got it! Kanao!

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.720
Ready, Kanao?

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.300 line:20%
<i>Which is it?</i>

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.680 line:20%
<i>His back was blocking it,
so I couldn't see it the moment it fell.</i>

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.890
HEADS

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.400
It's heads!

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.310
Kanao!

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.820
Good luck!

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.320
It's the heart that drives people.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.070
So, your heart can grow
as strong as you want it to!

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.370
All right! See you again someday!

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.580
H-How did you make it come up heads?

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.420
<i>I saw his hand when he flipped it.</i>

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.920
<i>I'm sure he didn't cheat.</i>

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.720
Just by chance.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.010
And if it was tails,

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.520
I was going to keep tossing it
over and over until it came up heads!

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.690
Take care!

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.620
You can do it! You can do it! You can do it!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.630
Yay!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:28.800
Here you go.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.510
Thanks!

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.130
Don't eat it now!

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.140
Please go out
and defeat tons of demons!

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.510
We'll do our best!

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.640
I told you not to eat it now!

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.640
Shut up!

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.980
Mr. Tomioka!

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.980
Are you heading into battle now?

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.650
Yes!

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.990
I hear that you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.150
Yes!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.160
You should keep at it.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660
Yes.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.700
Mr. Tomioka...

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.960
About Nezuko... Thank you very much.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.290
I had no idea you were putting
your life on the line.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.210
I just don't know
how I can ever thank you.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.090
You can thank me by doing good work.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.930
Our mission as Demon Slayers
is to kill demons.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.180
That's all.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.350
Right!

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:25.810
Take care, you guys!

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.320
You're all heartbroken
to say goodbye to me, aren't you?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.280
I can stay behind if you want!

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:38.160
Master Zenitsu, please try to learn
how to be considerate and respectful of girls.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.160
Right.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.870
I'm feeling giddy.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.160
But you do feel a little sad
that I'm leaving, don't you?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.920
We are not sad!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.670
Okay! You guys!

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.210
We're heading out now!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.590
Hey... Hey! Hey!

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.100
Wha...

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.350
Wh-What...

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.190 position:20% line:20%
INFINITE

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.190
What the hell is this creature?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.980
I bet this is that thing!

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.520
The master of this land!
The ruler of this land!

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:16.200 line:20%
See how long it is?
So intimidating! No mistake!

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.240 line:20%
It looks like it's asleep right now,
but don't let your guard down!

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.950
Uh, no, it's a train.
Haven't you ever seen one before?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.490
Shush! Calm down!

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.290
I'll lead the charge!

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.920
Hold up, Inosuke!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.500
You never know, it might be
the guardian spirit of this land.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.380
Also, you shouldn't attack all of a sudden.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.880
No, didn't you hear me? It's a train.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.050
A railway train, all right?

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.260
It's a vehicle for transporting people.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:43.060
You country bumpkin!

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.930
A train? So, is that
what the crow was talking about?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.110
What's his problem?

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.740
Comin' through!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.110
Stop it! Talk about embarrassing!

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.370
What are you doing? Hey, you!

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.660
Hey, these guys have swords!

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.160
The police! Call the police!

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.670
Oh, crap! Crap, crap, crap!

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.630
Run!

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.710
Thanks to you, we went through hell,
Inosuke! Say you're sorry!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.800
In the first place,
why did we have to run from the police?

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.680
We the Demon Slayers aren't officially
recognized by the government!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.890
We can't really walk around
in broad daylight with our swords.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.600
They wouldn't believe us

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.560
even if we explained about the demons,
and it would only confuse them.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.320 line:20%
Even though we're working so hard?

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.530 line:20%
Well, it can't be helped.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.240 line:20%
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.330
You can totally see them.
Put on some clothes, idiot.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.500
Oh, crap! The train's leaving!
Are the police still around?

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.090
We'll have to go even if they are.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.170
I'm taking you on! Master of this land!

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.550
Hey, idiot!

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.880
We should go, too!

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.300
Hey! You three!

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.060
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.180
Zenitsu!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.070
Man, it's fast!

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.200
Tanjiro...

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.740
Are you sure about bringing Nezuko along?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.210
Wouldn't the Demon Slayer Corps
Headquarters be the safest place for her?

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.420
Yeah. It's fine.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.840
Wherever we go,
Nezuko and I will be together.
