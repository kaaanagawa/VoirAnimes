00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.230
Naho! Kiyo! Sumi!

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.570
I'd like you to help me train.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.190
If I stop doing Total Concentration
Breathing while I'm asleep,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.320
can you clobber me
with these carpet beaters?

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.070
Please help me!

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.830
Very well!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.790
Thank you!

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.340
It's all good, right?

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.260
Master Tanjiro's doing a good job!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.050
Yes!

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.990
EPISODE 25:
TSUGUKO, KANAO TSUYURI

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.200
Spineless fool...

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.200
Please let me try again!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.950
Okay!

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240
If you please!

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.450
Give it all you've got!

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.250
This time, for sure!

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.840 line:20%
One more time please!

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.220
Just you again today, Tanjiro?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.800
I'm sorry!

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.010
I did ask them to come, but...

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.350
Well, it doesn't matter to me.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.850
I'll give them another nudge later!

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.570 line:20%
<i>I'm starting to get used to training</i>

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.610 line:20%
<i>while doing Total Concentration Breathing!</i>

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.040
<i>Although I can't sustain it all day
unless I really get myself pumped up,</i>

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.460 line:20%
497! 498! 499! 500! 501!

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.210
<i>the longer that I can keep doing
Total Concentration Breathing,</i>

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.460
<i>the bigger the stamina boost I get!</i>

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.140
You can do it!

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.740
<i>Hey, I can chase after her!</i>

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.990 line:20%
<i>I'm able to chase right after that girl!</i>

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.740
<i>I can keep up with her!</i>

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.890
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.430
Thank you very much!

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.110
Zenitsu! Inosuke!

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.780
I refuse to get involved!

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.130
You can do it! You can do it!
You can do it!

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.470
It broke!

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.060
Now all you have to break
is this huge gourd!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.890
Yeah!

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.900
I did it!

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.560
Thanks, all of you!

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.610
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.710
<i>So, Tanjiro's already gone off to train.</i>

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.380
<i>Jeez, it's the crack of dawn.</i>

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.920
<i>Putting in effort isn't my thing.</i>

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.300
<i>There's nothing more draining
than persevering every day.</i>

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.930
Oh, it's you.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.600
Maybe getting left behind
by Tanjiro is making me panic,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.440
but I can't get the hang of anything
even if he shows me for hours!

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.770
Now I realize that we're a total lost cause.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.980
Wait, did you just say,
"Yes, you are"?

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.900
How can you be so cruel?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.070
Would it kill you to say just once,
"You're working hard, too"?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.200
Did you just say, "Work harder"?

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.580
I guess there's no way out of it.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.580 position:20%
MEDICINE
For Zenitsu Agatsuma
Take 5 times daily
7 days' worth
After each meal

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.090
Gross!

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.520
Come on, Monitsu.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.980
What Tanjiro is trying to master is a skill
called "Total Concentration, Constant."

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.360
By continuing to do Total Concentration
Breathing every second of the day,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.990
your basic stamina level will skyrocket.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.750
Let's just go ahead and try it!

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.920
Impossible!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.840
Seriously impossible!

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.220 line:20%
I still can't sustain Total Concentration Breathing
all day unless I really throw myself into it,

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.100 line:20%
but I bet you two can do it!

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.850
You go like this
to make your lungs expand!

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.850
When that rattles your blood, your bones and
muscles will go, "Boom! Boom!" You gotta stop it!

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.360
All that's left to do is train like crazy!

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.070 line:20%
Now, now...

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.370 line:20%
We're talking about a basic skill,
or should I say a beginner's skill,

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.290 line:20%
so why wouldn't you be able to do it?

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.750 line:20%
But it's also true that one must put
great effort into mastering it, right?

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.750 line:20%
CALM STATE OF MIND

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.380
Well, why wouldn't you
be able to do it, though?

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.970 line:20%
I was sure it would be
child's play for you, Inosuke.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.560 line:20%
Are you sure you can't do it?

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.640 line:20%
Even though there's no reason
you can't do it?

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.400 line:20%
It can't be helped, then,
if you can't do it.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.690
Can't be helped! Can't be helped!

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.110
I can do it, all right! Why wouldn't I?

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.410
Don't mess with me,
or I swear I'll rip off your breasts!

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.830 line:20%
Please give it your all, Zenitsu!

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.910 line:20%
I'm your biggest cheerleader!

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.420
Yes, ma'am!

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.600
Kanao, you're in the same class,
so why don't you join them?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.790
More! More! Boom! Boom! Boom!

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.250
You damn wimp!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.250
You got this, Zenitsu!

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200
<i>It hurts.</i>

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.370
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.960
<i>I'm sad.</i>

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.210
<i>I feel hopeless.</i>

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.960
<i>I'm in agony.</i>

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.550
<i>I'm lonely.</i>

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.680
<i>That was my life.</i>

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.720
<i>But then, one day,</i>

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.730
<i>I heard a sound like a snap.</i>

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.490
<i>And I never knew pain again.</i>

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.290
<i>I never knew pain again.</i>

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.590
<i>While living in poverty,</i>

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.090
<i>even when my parents sold me,</i>

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.340 line:20%
<i>it didn't make me feel sad.</i>

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.010 line:20%
<i>Excuse me, do you have a minute?</i>

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.860 line:20%
<i>Could you tell us
why that child is all tied up?</i>

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.070 line:20%
<i>Is she a criminal, perhaps?</i>

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.700 line:20%
<i>Isn't it obvious?
She's flea-ridden, and her face is dirty.</i>

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.660 line:20%
<i>Not to mention, she might try to escape.</i>

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.990 line:20%
<i>Hello, there. Nice to meet you.</i>

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.660 line:20%
<i>My name is Kanae Kocho.</i>

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.920 line:20%
<i>What's your name?</i>

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.470 line:20%
<i>She's got no name, all right?</i>

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.300 line:20%
<i>Her parents never gave her one.</i>

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.640 line:20%
<i>Happy now? Get away from her!</i>

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.890 line:20%
<i>Please don't touch my sister.</i>

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.810 line:20%
<i>What's your problem, you two?</i>

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.440 line:20%
<i>If you wanna talk to this kid, pay up!</i>

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.440
<i>All right, then, we'll purchase her.</i>

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.110 line:20%
<i>Would this be enough?</i>

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.870
<i>Hey! Come back here, dammit!</i>

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.670 line:20%
<i>I'd pick it up right now if I were you!</i>

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.840 line:20%
<i>After all, there's a crowd here,
and the wind is strong!</i>

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.510 line:20%
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.420 line:20%
<i>It's fine!</i>

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.970 line:20%
<i>Please excuse us!</i>

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.930 line:20%
<i>Hands off! It's my property!</i>

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.930
<i>Oh my. Oh my.</i>

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.620 line:20%
<i>Sister! Sister!</i>

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.620
<i>Sister, this child is hopeless!</i>

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.090 line:20%
<i>She can't do anything without being told!
That goes for meals, as well!</i>

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.630 line:20%
<i>She won't touch her food
unless I tell her to eat!</i>

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.130
<i>Even as her stomach growls and growls!</i>

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.140
<i>Oh my. Oh my.</i>

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.470
<i>What exactly are we going to do with her?</i>

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.020
<i>Now, now, don't be like that, okay?</i>

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.230
<i>I just love that smile of yours, Shinobu.</i>

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.360 line:20%
<i>But we can't do anything with a kid who can't
even think for herself! It's dangerous!</i>

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.360 line:20%
<i>Well, you do have a point, but...</i>

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.320 line:20%
<i>She can't do anything on her own!
She can't decide for herself!</i>

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.450
<i>All right, when you're on your own,
you can decide by flipping this coin.</i>

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.160
<i>Right, Kanao?</i>

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.660
<i>Sister!</i>

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.920
<i>You don't have to take this
so seriously, you know...</i>

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.960
<i>since Kanao is so adorable!</i>

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.800
<i>That's not a good reason!</i>

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.050 line:20%
<i>As long as it's given a chance,</i>

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.800 line:20%
<i>a person's soul will open up,
so don't worry.</i>

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.680
<i>When you fall in love
with some boy someday,</i>

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.600
<i>you'll change, too, Kanao.</i>

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560
You're doing great! Keep it up!

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:22.230
Right now! Harder! Bam!
That's it! You can do it, Zenitsu!

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.200
You've got this! Looking good!

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.080
Inosuke! Inosuke!

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.880 line:20%
They'll be bringing
our reforged Nichirin Swords soon!

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.760 line:20%
For real?

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.720 line:20%
Yeah! I just heard it from the crow!

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.300
That's Mr. Haganezuka's scent!

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.100
Yahoo!

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.810
Let's go! Let's go!

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.770
Yahoo!

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.850
Mr. Haganezuka!

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.900
Hey! Hey! Mr. Haganezuka!

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.400
Long time no see!

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.030
How have you been?

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.210
M-Mr. Haganezuka?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.250
How dare you snap my sword in two?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.550
You've got a lot a nerve!

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.220
I'm sorry! B-But to be honest,
I came this close to being killed!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.050
My opponent was insanely strong!

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.800
Not true! That has nothing to do with it!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.770
You're the one to blame!
It's all your fault!

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.390
You're pitifully weak!
That's why it broke!

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.270
Otherwise, my sword
would never snap like that!

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.900 line:20%
But...

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.480
I'm going to kill you!

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.660
Is that a new training regimen?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.660
Probably not.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.120
Well, Mr. Haganezuka
is a very passionate man.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.420
Yes.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.090
He loves his swords more than anyone.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.130
There's no one like him
even in the sword-forgers' homeland.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.130
You're probably right.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.930
My name is Kanamori.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.140
I was the one who forged
Master Inosuke's swords.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.640
I would be thrilled
if they prove useful in battle.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.240
Beautiful, aren't they?

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:33.740
The dull sheen of that
indigo-gray hue is so cool.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.660
It's a fine color for a sword.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.580
I'm happy for you, Inosuke,
since your sword was chipped all over.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.670
How do you like the grips?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.420
The thing is, this is the first time
I've ever forged swords for a dual-wielder.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.180
Master Inosuke?

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.770
Better.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.360
I'll kill you, you miserable brat!

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.530
You bastard! Are you flaunting it?

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.240 line:20%
We're sorry! We're sorry!

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:22.040
Bastard! That's it! You're a dead man!

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.460 line:20%
Unbelievable! He's unbelievable!

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.920
We're sorry!

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.460
We're sorry!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.920 line:20%
Taking a stone to those swords?
Unbelievable!

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.840
We're sorry! We're sorry!

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.800
We're sorry!

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.180
Looks like he'll be fine.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.810
After all, Master Tanjiro
was really giving it his all!

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.060
Let's make him some rice balls again!

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.310
Yeah!

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.870 line:20%
<i>My body's changed!</i>

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.950 line:20%
<i>I can't wait to swing my sword!</i>

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.370
<i>With these hands!</i>

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.950
<i>My Nichirin Sword!</i>

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.080
<i>I did it!</i>

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.970
Good move! You can do it!

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.090 line:20%
<i>Don't let up for a second! You can do it!</i>

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.970
<i>I did it!</i>

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.230 line:20%
<i>Go!</i>

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.900 position:80% line:50%
SENSE OF REASON

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.900 line:20%
TAN

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.900
<i>This medicated water stinks.
It would be cruel to splash her with it.</i>

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.650
- He won!
- Does that count as winning?

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.660
Either way, it's the same thing!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.950
Yeah! I did it!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.750
I did it!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.750 line:20%
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.510
All right! Open up!

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.680
Okay! Looks like your jaw
is as good as new.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.140
All right, you can close your mouth now.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.560
That concludes this exam.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.520
Since you're physically sound now,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.150
you may take on your missions
without any misgivings.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.400
So, I'm done with my training?

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.570
Yes. All that's left for you now
is actual combat.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.400
Right!

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.660
Oh, before I forget, Lady Shinobu...

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.780
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.410
What would that be?

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.370
Have you ever heard
of the Hinokami Kagura Dance?

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.670
I have not.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.580
Uh, w-well then,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.130
how about Fire Breathing?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.380
Never heard of it.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.590
A-Actually, this is something
that happened during my childhood.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.890
Yes, yes.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.760
I see.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.140
So, for some reason, Tanjiro,
your father used Fire Breathing.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:52.520
All I can tell you is that
while Flame Breathing does exist,

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.780
it's not Fire Breathing.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.570
What? They're not the same thing?

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.030
I'm not familiar with the details myself.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.570
Please forgive me.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.790
But I do know that they're very strict
about the exact phrasing.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.710 line:20%
"Flame Breathing" must never
be referred to as "Fire Breathing."

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.670 line:20%
The Flame Hashira, Rengoku,
might know something about this,

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.550 line:20%
but unfortunately, he's out on a mission.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.340
Understood!

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:21.180
Thank you for all that you've taught me.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.560
I'll ask Mr. Rengoku if I ever get
a chance to see him again.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.640
Right.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.430
Now then, please excuse me!

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680
Kamado?

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.560
Yes?

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.060
I'm expecting great things of you.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.570
Right!

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.340
She's asleep all day again today.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.760
I know they said you could be sleeping
to recover your stamina,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:09.140
but it does worry me if you don't open
your eyes once in a while.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.650
Hey, I'll probably be leaving this place
soon to go on my next mission.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.490
I've healed physically,
and I've gotten a little stronger, too.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.910
And I'm still doing
Total Concentration, Constant right now.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.120
I think Zenitsu and Inosuke
will be with me, too.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.000
Having those two by my side
gives me confidence.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.920
I see.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.960
You think so, too, Nezuko?

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.670
They're both good guys.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.300
To turn you back into a human,

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.720
I gotta bring down
the strongest demons that I can,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.560
and send Miss Tamayo
their blood samples.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.600
<i>Am I capable of doing that?</i>

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.650
<i>I know you can do it, Big Brother.</i>

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.200
Thanks, Nezuko.
You just encouraged me, didn't you?

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.000
I'll try my hardest, all right?

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:11.160 position:80% line:20%
PREVIEW

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.730
Maintaining Total Concentration
Breathing is way too demanding!

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.950
It's totally not happening, dammit.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.070
You both look wiped out.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.160
I know!

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.910
Here's a Taisho secret for you!

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.370
The medicated water we use
for reflex training, when added to your bath,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.710
is actually great for healing
exhaustion and wounds.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.420
Well, I'm going off to train,
but maybe you two should take a break.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.880
I'm nowhere near done yet!
Don't underestimate me!

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.840
We'll train some more?

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.220
All right! All we gotta do
is show up, right?

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.220
Next, Episode 26, "New Mission."

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.600
Okay, I'm heading out now, Nezuko!

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.020
