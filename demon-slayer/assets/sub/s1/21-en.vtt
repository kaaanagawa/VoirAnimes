<i>Rui!</i>

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.600
<i>Rui!</i>

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.060
<i>Rui!</i>

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.810
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.230
<i>You know you're not supposed to be outside!</i>

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.000
EPISODE 21:
AGAINST CORPS RULES

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.420
<i>I was always very frail</i>

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.340
<i>ever since I was born.</i>

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.880
<i>I'd never even run.</i>

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.010
<i>Just walking was a struggle.</i>

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.230
<i>Until Master Muzan appeared.</i>

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.610
<i>You pitiful thing. Let me save you.</i>

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.240
<i>My parents weren't happy about it.</i>

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.710
<i>Because now that I'd acquired
a strong body,</i>

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.170
<i>I could never expose myself to sunlight,</i>

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.670
<i>and I had to devour humans.</i>

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.260
<i>What have you done?</i>

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.770
<i>What on earth have you done?</i>

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.230
<i>Rui!</i>

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.530
<i>Long ago, I heard a wonderful story.</i>

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.870
<i>There was once a father who died
trying to save his drowning child.</i>

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.750
<i>I was deeply moved.</i>

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.550
<i>Such astounding parental love.
And such a bond, as well.</i>

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.550
<i>This father who drowned in the river
had fulfilled his role as a parent.</i>

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.140
<i>And yet,</i>

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.180
<i>for some reason, my own parents...</i>

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.320
<i>My own parents</i>

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.570
<i>tried to...</i>

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.570
<i>kill me.</i>

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.990
<i>All my mother did was sob,</i>

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.330
<i>never lifting a finger to protect me
as I was about to be killed.</i>

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.010
<i>They must've been imposters.</i>

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.640
<i>The bond between us wasn't real.</i>

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.850 line:20%
<i>Sorry...</i>

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.480
<i>She's saying something.</i>

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.280
<i>So, she's still alive?</i>

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.660
<i>...for not giving you a strong,
healthy body. I'm so sorry.</i>

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.660 line:20%
<i>Those were my mother's last words
before she died.</i>

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.330
<i>She died.</i>

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.960
<i>It's all right, Rui!</i>

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.090
<i>We're going to die with you!</i>

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.510 line:20%
<i>I was so enraged
that he'd tried to kill me</i>

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.180 line:20%
<i>that my father's words
went over my head.</i>

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.720 line:20%
<i>But in that moment,</i>

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.850 line:20%
<i>I realized that he meant to die with me
to atone for my sin of having murdered another.</i>

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.320 line:20%
<i>It was a genuine bond.</i>

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.860
<i>And that night,</i>

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.450
<i>I severed it</i>

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.290
<i>with my own two hands.</i>

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.120
<i>Even so,</i>

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.840 line:20%
<i>Master Muzan gave me
words of encouragement.</i>

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.380
<i>It was all your parents' fault
for refusing to accept you.</i>

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.050
<i>Take pride in your own strength.</i>

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.180
<i>I had no other choice
but to look at it that way.</i>

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.390
<i>I couldn't bear the weight
of what I'd done.</i>

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.780
<i>Even knowing that I only had
myself to blame...</i>

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.290
<i>Every single day...</i>

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.790
<i>I missed my parents so much
that I could barely stand it.</i>

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.420
<i>Even after creating a fake family,</i>

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.880
<i>the feeling of emptiness
wouldn't go away.</i>

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.670
<i>Since I was the one
with the most power,</i>

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.140
<i>there was no one who could protect me...</i>

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.890
<i>who could shield me.</i>

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.310
<i>The more powerful I became,</i>

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.930
<i>the less I remembered
about being a human.</i>

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.650
<i>And I was losing sight
of what it was that I wanted to do.</i>

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.020
<i>Seeking a bond
that I could never claim for myself.</i>

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.370
<i>Even though it was
simply out of my reach</i>

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.830
<i>no matter how I strained
to get my hands on it.</i>

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.470
<i>That small body...</i>

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.640 line:20%
<i>is giving off the scent of a grief
too overwhelming for him to bear.</i>

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.650 position:20%
LOWER FIVE

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.450
<i>So warm.</i>

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.330
<i>Hands as gentle as sunlight.</i>

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.750
<i>Now I remember as clear as day.</i>

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.340
<i>What I wanted was to apologize.</i>

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.680
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.600
<i>I was... I was to blame for it all.</i>

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.100
<i>I hope you can forgive me.</i>

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.860 line:20%
<i>But since I've killed scores of people,</i>

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.690 line:20%
<i>I'm going to Hell, aren't I?</i>

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280 line:20%
<i>Father...</i>

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.610 line:20%
<i>Mother...</i>

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.370 line:20%
<i>I can't go to the same place as you, can I?</i>

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.540 line:20%
<i>That's not true.</i>

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.540
We'll be going together even if it's to Hell.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.050
Rui...

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.920
Father...

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.550
Mother...

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.560
Rui...

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.140 line:20%
No matter where you go,
we'll be with you.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.440
It was all...

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.530
It was all my fault!

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.820
I'm sorry!

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.410
I'm sorry!

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.080
I'm sorry!

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.830
I'm sorry!

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.730
Don't waste any sympathy
on a demon that devoured humans.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.280
It doesn't matter if it looks like a child.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.740
It's still a hideous monster
that's lived for decades.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.450 line:20%
To avenge the people who were killed,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.450
to make sure there are no more victims,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.460 line:20%
of course, I'll bring my blade down
on any demon's neck without mercy!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.130
But as for those for whom
being a demon meant despair,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.760
those who regretted their own actions...

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.800
I will never trample over them!

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.720 line:20%
Because demons were once human, too!

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.350 line:20%
Just like me, they were human, too!

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.310 line:20%
Please step off him!

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.230
They're not hideous monsters at all!

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.480
Demons are hopeless creatures!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.990
They're tragic creatures!

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.710
You're...

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.090
Oh my...

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.600
Why would you get in my way, Tomioka?

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.310
After telling me that we could never
be friends with demons...

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.070
How should I put this?

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.480
That's exactly why...

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.990 position:20%
EVIL DEMON

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.450 line:20%
no one likes you, you know.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.990
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:31.000
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.020
Man, this antidote
of Lady Kocho's is effective!

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.900 line:20%
That's right. And she prepared it
after one look at this situation.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.110 line:20%
She's truly amazing.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.530
That goes for him, too.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.110
Oh, that guy?

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.780
Because he defeated that demon,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.830
it slowed the circulation
of the poison just a bit.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.290 position:20%
FINISHED TREATMENT

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.290 line:20%
All right! This should do it!

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:22.050 position:80% line:50%
KAKUSHI

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.750
Looking good!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.920
Chances are, they'll all pull through.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.210
Still, I'd like to wrap things up quickly

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.760
and leave this place
as soon as possible, wouldn't you?

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.930
Yeah, me, too.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.800
I mean, this place really, really stinks!

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.560 line:20%
All right, Tomioka,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.480 line:20%
please move out of the way.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.990
I'm not...

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.660
I'm not disliked by people.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.910
Well, I'm sorry. You haven't even realized
that people don't like you, then?

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.040
That was uncalled for.
Please forgive me.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800
Little boy!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.630
Yes!

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:07.470
What you're protecting there is a demon.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.010
I don't want you to get hurt,
so please move away.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.140 line:20%
Y-You're mistaken!

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.020 line:20%
I mean, you're not mistaken, but...

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.600 line:20%
she's my kid sister!

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.020 line:20%
She's my kid sister, so... You see...

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.570
Is that right? Poor thing.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.030
In that case,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.580 line:20%
I shall use a gentle toxin to kill her,
so she won't suffer, all right?

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.540
Can you move?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.670 line:20%
Make yourself move
even if you can't move.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.210 line:20%
Take your sister and run.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.920
Tomioka...

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.010
Sorry for the trouble!

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.590
Thank you very much!

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.220
Isn't that against the Corps rules?

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.610
<i>My whole body is aching! It's so painful!</i>

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.910
<i>I want to scream from the pain!
Deal with it!</i>

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.410
<i>Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it!
Deal with it! Deal with it! Deal with it!</i>

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.420 line:20%
<i>Does this mean I'll have to quit
the Demon Slayer Corps?</i>

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.550
<i>Even if she's my sister,</i>

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.170
<i>there's no way they'd let one of their
swordsmen travel with a demon!</i>

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.310
I see you're dead serious, Tomioka.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.890
Who would've thought
a Hashira would ever defend a demon?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.770
Whether you're dead serious or not,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.780
I'm not going to join you
in stalling for time.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.610
So, good day to you.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.460 line:20%
Is that your attempt
at catching up with me?

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.510
I don't mind you trying to stop me,

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.770
but don't forget about the other one!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.480
<i>Don't stop running!</i>

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.070
<i>Keep moving!</i>

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.110
<i>You gotta run as far away as you can!</i>

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.370
<i>Not good!</i>

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.580
<i>What happened?</i>

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.040
<i>It was all I could do to just keep running!</i>

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:43.750
<i>Nezuko!</i>

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.420 position:80% line:20%
DESTROY

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.420
<i>A Demon Slayer!</i>

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.260
Run, Nezuko!

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.140
Run! Make a run for it!

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.810
Don't get caught no matter what!

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.140
Hurry—

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.200
She shrunk and turned into a child.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.790
<i>All she's doing is running away.
Not a single attack.</i>

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.130
<i>But why?</i>

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.340
<i>No need to ponder.</i>

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.220
<i>My only job is to slay
this demon as I was told.</i>

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:38.560 line:20%
Tomioka?

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.980 line:20%
Are you listening, Tomioka?

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.980 line:20%
Since the purpose of my attack was to slay
a demon, and therefore justified,

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.480 line:20%
I don't believe it could be
construed as a violation.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.110
But what you're doing
is against the Corps rules.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.160
You're preventing me
from slaying a demon.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.740
Just what are your intentions here?

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.710
Don't you have anything to say?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.880
This is your final warning.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.210
Give me a reason at least.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.260
If I'm remembering this right,
it was two years ago.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.140
Please don't start some long, rambling
story from that far back in time.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.980
Are you just being spiteful?

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.770
Are you perhaps still angry
that I pointed out how people don't like you?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.780
Message! Message!

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.360
I have a message from headquarters!

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.000
Tanjiro and Nezuko are to be taken into custody
and brought back to headquarters!

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.710
Tanjiro and the demon, Nezuko,
are to be taken into custody

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.590
and brought back to headquarters!

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.130 line:20%
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.180 line:20%
with a scar on his forehead!

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.720 line:20%
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.720
Bring them back! Bring them back!

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.720 line:20%
Are you Nezuko?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.060
Bring them back! Bring them back!

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.570
Tanjiro, dressed in a checkered haori,
with a scar on his forehead!

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.070
Nezuko, a demon girl
with a bamboo muzzle!

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.120
Bring them back! Bring them back!

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.160
He has a scar on his forehead.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.460
All right, take him into custody.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.170
Look. His jawbone seems
to be broken, doesn't it?

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.470
I feel bad about tying him up.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.890
Wh-Who the hell is this?

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.310
I don't know.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.350
A demon? Couldn't be, right?

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.350 line:20%
Is it a human?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.730 line:20%
He's wearing our uniform trousers.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.860
Oh hey, this is a mask! He's a human!

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.860
All right, let's bring him in.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.740
This guy's really banged up!

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.240
Why's he strung up like this?

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.710 line:20%
<i>There was nothing I could do...</i>

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.540 line:20%
<i>On my own, I couldn't bring down
even a single demon!</i>

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.010
<i>You know what?</i>

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.510
<i>Maybe I'm not that strong.</i>

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.520
FINISHED TREATMENT

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.020 line:20%
They wrapped us up like mummies.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:33.610
<i>Who are these people?</i>

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.280
<i>They seem to be cleaning up
this place really efficiently.</i>

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.150
<i>And that girl there...</i>

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.660
<i>Isn't she the girl from Final Selection?</i>

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.160
<i>She has the same kind of hair ornament
as the lady who wrapped us up.</i>

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.750
Should we bring them
to the Butterfly Mansion, as well?

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.330
Yes, bring all of the wounded to our place.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.710
I'll be hunting down
the demons in the area

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.790
so you can work without any worries.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.380 line:20%
<i>Come to think of it,
I've heard about them.</i>

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.840 line:20%
<i>The cleanup crew, the Kakushis.</i>

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.890 line:20%
<i>The unit that cleans up after
the Demon Slayer Corps battles demons.</i>

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:11.190
<i>They say that most of its members are people
who have no swordsmanship skills.</i>

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.190
It's daybreak.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.990 line:20%
Wake up.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.870 line:20%
Hey, I said wake up!

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:13.210 line:20%
Wake... Hey! Hey you!

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.880 line:20%
Come on, you! Come on!

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.630
Are you gonna sleep all day?

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.550 line:20%
Wake the hell up, will you?

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.510
You're in the presence of the Hashiras!

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:16.040 position:20% line:20%
RUSTLE RUSTLE

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.860
Lately, we've been teaming up
on missions quite frequently, right?

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.900
Can you at least answer me please?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.990
Or are you perhaps still angry
that I pointed out how people don't like you?

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.040
Don't you have anything to say?

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.250
Time for a Taisho secret.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.920
Apparently, Kocho can't stand cats or dogs
or any kind of furry creature.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.050
You finally open your mouth,
and that's the first thing you say?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.340
You didn't deny it,
so does that mean it's true?

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.470
People don't like you
because of that lack of tact.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.220
- People...
- "...do like me."

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.970
Any answer but that one please.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.140
Next, Episode 22,
"Master of the Mansion."
