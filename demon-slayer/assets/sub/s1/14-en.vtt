WEBVTT

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.980
Take this!

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:03.480
Move it!

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.600
Take this!

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.810
Draw your sword and fight me!

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.070
You spineless punk!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.410
Enough!

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.830
I'll just have to skewer you
along with that box!

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.830
Knock it off!

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.300 line:20%
Knock it off!

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.980
EPISODE 14:
THE HOUSE WITH
THE WISTERIA FAMILY CREST

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.110
Knock it off!

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.540
He broke his bones!

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.290
Aren't you a member
of the Demon Slayers Corps?

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.920
Don't you get why Zenitsu refuses
to draw his sword?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.090
It's because it's taboo for us to draw
our swords on each other for no reason!

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.800 line:20%
But here you are,
giving him a one-sided beatdown!

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.340 line:20%
Is that fun for you?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.810
You're the lowest of the low!

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.940
Oh, so that's why?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.820
My bad.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.200
In that case, let's fight barehanded.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.950
No! I don't think you get it at all!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.990
First...

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.830
We're not supposed to fight
each other, period!

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.040 line:20%
Fighting barehanded doesn't make it all right!

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.960
Listen to me!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.020
<i>Look at him!
How can he move like that?</i>

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.770
<i>I mean, Tanjiro just busted
some of his ribs.</i>

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.540
Actually, isn't Tanjiro
running afoul of the taboo himself?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.000
He did break his bones.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.190
<i>Th-This guy...</i>

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.990
<i>His attacks are bizarrely low!</i>

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.740
<i>It's just like...</i>

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.950 line:20%
<i>Just like...</i>

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.660
<i>battling a four-legged beast!</i>

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.870
<i>Target him low!</i>

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.040
<i>Even lower than your opponent!</i>

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.260
<i>The flexibility of his joints!</i>

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.720
<i>It's superhuman!</i>

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.430
Pretty amazing, aren't I?

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.100
Pretty amazing, aren't I?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.230
<i>He said it twice!</i>

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.850
<i>Singing his own praises...</i>

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.770
And look what else I can do!

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.530
Cut it out! Don't do stuff like that!

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.780
Knock it off when you've got busted bones!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.450
It's gonna get worse!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.620
Worse? Fine by me!

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.840
Nothing can top
the pleasure of this moment!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.800
You need to think hard about the future!

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.670
What do I care?

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.430
You need to...

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.930
calm down!

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.020
That sound!
Are your skulls fractured?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.450
Huh? A girl? Huh? Your face!

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.460 line:20%
What the hell?

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.460
You've got a problem
with my face or something?

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.800
You're one creepy guy, you know that?

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.140
You've got such a ripped body,
but there's a girl's face sitting on top of it.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.970
Why the hell are you staring
at my face like that?

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.640
I-I'm not!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.980
I'm not looking at your face!

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.650
We don't have a problem with your face!

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.360
It's quite petite, fair-skinned,
and therefore attractive!

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.110
You're a corpse! Come at me!

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.660
Not happening!
I'm not gonna attack you anymore!

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.530
Try head-butting me one more time!

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.870
Nope, I'm done!

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.540
I said do it! Come on!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.420
You sit yourself down! Are you okay?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.250
Hey, Big Forehead!

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.420
Let me tell you my name.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.670
It's Inosuke Hashibira!

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.260
Don't you forget it!

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.880
What characters do you use to spell that?

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.840
Spell? Spell...

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.720
I don't know how to read or write!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.890
That name is written on my loincloth—

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.640
What's wrong?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.480
He froze.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.780
What's the matter?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.790
He collapsed!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.080
Is he dead?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.790
He's not dead.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.000
It's probably a concussion.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.340
Because I head-butted the hell out of him.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.640
Are you okay, Tanjiro?

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.890
Yeah.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.810
Amazing! Can I touch your head?

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:37.850
Here!

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.180
<i>That's scary!</i>

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.900
<i>Not a drop of blood from Tanjiro's head.</i>

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.020
<i>How hard is it anyway?</i>

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.190
<i>I mean, the wild boar's passed out.</i>

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.450
Tanjiro, your head is so hard!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.740
You think so?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.950
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.960
DEMON SLAYER:
KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.730
He's awake!

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.270
Fight me! Fight me!

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.150
Hey, you!

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.360 line:20%
This is how he is when he wakes up?

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.730 line:20%
I hate that more than anything!

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.580
What the hell are you guys doing?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.580
It's a burial.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.590
You help out, too, Inosuke.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.300
There are still people
who were killed inside the house.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.380
What's the point of burying
the corpses of creatures?

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.760
I'm not doing that! I'm not helping out!

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.510
Forget that! Fight me!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.810
<i>Man, he really is a loon.</i>

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.150
<i>What does he mean, what's the point?</i>

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.770
I see.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.150
You can't do it because
your wounds are hurting you.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.200
<i>Those two are beyond help!</i>

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.120
<i>They're both crazy!</i>

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.120
No, that's okay.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.660
After all, we all have
a different pain threshold.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.540
Moving everyone who died
outside that house,

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.170
then burying them by covering them
with dirt is a lot of work.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:34.970 line:20%
Zenitsu and these kids and I
will do our best, so don't worry!

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:37.050 line:20%
<i>He's so off.</i>

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.050 line:20%
<i>He's so off.</i>

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.310
You should get some rest, Inosuke.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.190
Sorry to ask too much of you!

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.060
Don't underestimate me, dammit!

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.190
I'll bury a hundred,
no, two hundred of your corpses!

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.200 line:20%
Just watch! I'm going to bury
more than anyone of you!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
What is that person doing?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.500
Better not look.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.460
Yeah.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.720
Descend the mountain!

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.020
Descend the mountain!

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.390
That crow is talking!

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.730
Just don't think anymore.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.020
Okay.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.320
All right, follow me!

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.320
Follow yours truly!

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.990
Hey!

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.410
Where are you going?

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.540
We're descending the mountain.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.830
We're not done with our battle yet!

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.460
You're tired, aren't you?

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.250
Come on, we're heading down.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.210
I'm not tired!

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.220
Let's fight!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.930
I won't have it!

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.680
I won't have it! I won't have it!

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.850 line:20%
You can't go, Shoichi!

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.560
You're powerful, Shoichi!

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.230
Shoichi is the one
who's gonna protect me!

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.700
Can't you see Shoichi doesn't want to stay?

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.870
Please don't leave me behind!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.740 line:20%
You stop that right now!

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.120
Hold out your hands!

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.840
That will ward off demons.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.800
You with marechi,
keep that on your person!

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.050
It smells like wisteria.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.680
Wisteria?

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.760
It's a flower that demons can't abide.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.310
You should hold onto that.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.980
Demon repellent!

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.560
Demon repellent!

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.570
We're truly grateful!

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.240
We can get home on our own.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.110 line:20%
Take care, now!

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.240
Now then, follow me!

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.580
Follow yours truly!

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.500
Fight me!

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.010
I swear I'm gonna find a weak point
and bring you down, loser!

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.630
My name's not "loser"!

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.680
It's Tanjiro Kamado!

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.930
Gonpachiro Kamaboko!

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.850
I'm gonna bring you down!

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.470 line:20%
Who the hell are you talking about?

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.350 line:20%
- That would be you!
- No, it's someone else!

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.810 line:20%
Can you talk any louder?

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.860
WISTERIA

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.320
A wisteria family crest...

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.830
Rest time! Rest time!

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.960
Since you've sustained injuries,
you're to rest until you're fully recovered!

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.630
You sure it's okay to rest?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.630
I just fought a demon
while injured, you know.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.510
Ke-ke-ke.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.720
"Ke-ke-ke"?

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.390
Let's eat this thing.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.310
What?

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.730
Yes?

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.150
Sorry to bother you so late at night!

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.190
A monster!

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.400
It's a monster!

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.360
Hey you!

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.110
Who the hell are you?

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.110
I see you're a demon hunter.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.160
You look pretty weak!

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.410
Hey!

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.870
Come in.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.420
That old lady sure walks fast!

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.760
This is where you'll be staying.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.260
A change of clothes.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.850
And here is your meal.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.310
She has to be a monster, Tanjiro!
That old lady's a monster!

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.900
She's so quick, it's eerie!
She's a monster!

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.270
A monster hag—

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.240 line:20%
Use your chopsticks.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.880 line:20%
If you're that hungry,
you can have this, too.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.430 line:20%
Here.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.180 line:20%
No!

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.140 line:20%
<i>He's totally forgotten about the box!</i>

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.440 line:20%
<i>Gimme a break, you thug!
Moron! Eyelashes!</i>

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.190
Your bedding.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.320
There she is! The monster hag—

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.450
First come, first served!

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.370
I'm taking this one!

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.660
That's fine. Sleep wherever you want.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.920
Where do you want to sleep, Zenitsu?

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.460
Here is the doctor.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.800
Hello.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.260
Yes.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.600
Severe!

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.900
Who would've guessed
that all three of us had broken ribs?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.190 line:20%
2 RIBS                3 RIBS                   4 RIBS

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.200
This knot hurts more than my ribs.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.530
Sorry.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.040
Hey, you'd better apologize.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.540
It really hurt, you know.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.160
Getting pounded to a pulp like that.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.710
Say you're sorry.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.960
I'll pass.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.340
Say you're sorry!

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.170
I'll pass!

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.460
Just say you're sorry!

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.050
If you're gonna be like that,
we're not eating with you anymore.

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.550
What's up with that?

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:57.060
Meals always taste better
when you eat together, you know.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.390
He's right about that.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.850
Did you guys hurt
your heads or something?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.810
Who are you to talk?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.400 line:20%
Is there something I can help you with?

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:07.530 line:20%
Monster!

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:08.730 line:20%
Hey!

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:29.260 line:20%
WISTERIA

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.030
According to the crow,

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.490
this house with the wisteria
family crest belongs to a family

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.500
that was once rescued
by demon hunters.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.460
That's why they take care of people
for free if they're demon hunters.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.290
That's what I was told,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.260
but I never thought
they'd show us this much hospitality.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.010 line:20%
Just how great is the Demon Slayers Corps?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.850 line:20%
Now that you mention it, Inosuke,
why did you join the Corps?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.020 line:20%
You had some kind of reason, didn't you?

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:45.440
A member of the Demon Slayers Corps
barged in on me on my mountain,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.070
so we competed to see
who was stronger, and I seized his sword.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.070
<i>What an unfortunate soul.</i>

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.240
And then, I heard there was something
called "Final Selection,"

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.080
and the fact that demons do exist.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.080
So that's why you joined
the Demon Slayers Corps?

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.210
And hey, so you and I both
grew up in the mountains, huh?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.460
Don't lump me in with you!

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.470
I don't have any parents or siblings!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.720
Testing my strength against other
living creatures is my only pleasure!

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.310
Is that right?

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:23.230
Is that right?

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.950
Tanjiro, no one else is asking,
so I'm gonna ask myself.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.490
Why are you traveling with a demon?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.880
Zenitsu...

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.800
You knew about that
and still protected the box, huh?

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.970
You really are a great guy,
you know that?

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.590
Thanks!

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.680
You...

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.770
You really shouldn't heap
so much praise on me!

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.350
I've got a keen sense of smell.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.480
I knew it from the start.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.020
How kind you are, Zenitsu...

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.070
and how strong...

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.200
No, I'm not strong.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:17.360
Don't give me that.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.580
I haven't forgiven you for stopping me
from bringing Shoichi along.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.790 line:20%
It's trying to come out!
It's trying to come out!

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:31.790 line:20%
It's all right.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.630 line:20%
How can it be all right? Huh? Huh?

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.380 line:20%
Shush!

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.680 line:20%
It's the middle of the night, Zenitsu!

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.640
<i>Why won't he take the bait?</i>

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.510
<i>Even when I stole his food...</i>

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.690
<i>Come to think of it,
why did he get mad a couple of times?</i>

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.730
<i>I forgot.</i>

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.200
Oh my gosh! It's not even locked?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.700
P-P-Protect me!
Someone please protect me!

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.490
Even you'll do, Inosuke!

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.700
Stay away from me!

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.970
It's out!

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.720
I gotta hide! I'm so scared!

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.810
Nezuko!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.580
That's too much thinking.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.630
Zenitsu...

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.960
Nezuko's my—

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.840
Tanjiro...

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.090
Listen to me.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.510
Z-Zenitsu?

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.100
Listen to me.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.110
Just who do you think you are?

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.900
So, you've been traveling
with a girl this cute?

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.740
With a girl this cute in tow,
day after day, you've been traveling,

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.830
and you've been on cloud nine
the whole time, huh?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.250
Zenitsu, it's not like—

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.330 line:20%
Give me back all the blood I shed!

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.250
I... Listen, I...

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:39.420
I didn't give it my all just so you could spend
time in la-la land, making out with a girl!

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.090
That's not why I got pummeled and kicked
by that weird wild boar, right?

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.470
Zenitsu, calm down!
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.640 line:20%
Demon Slayer Corps
is not something you'd join for fun!

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.480 line:20%
Guys like you gotta be purged! Immediately!

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.610
Come to think of it, there's also the crime
of thwarting my marriage

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.490
and sending Shoichi home.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.740
Purged immediately!

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.990
Don't ever underestimate the Corps!

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.080
A guy like you! A guy like you!

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.170
Zenitsu, cut it out!

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.090
Mock the Demon Slayers Corps...

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:24.180
and you'll get sent to Hell!

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.640
