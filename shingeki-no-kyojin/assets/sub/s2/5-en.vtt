00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
"Historia"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.170
Come on! The goal is right here!

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.670
Keep it up!

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340
Nine hours and twelve minutes.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.590
Not a bad time, considering the weather.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.640
Thought we were gonna die out there.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.350
No one ever said winter training
would be this tough.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.690
Damn it, I can't feel my legs.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.520
I wish they'd let us inside already.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.480
I bet they're busy putting together
a huge feast for us! Yum...

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.610
Hey!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.950
Christa is missing.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.990
Huh?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.160
She was sticking with Daz
since he wasn't doing so well.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.330
Daz isn't here either.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.040
Ymir as well.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.460
Maybe they're with the last squad?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.130
Can't be. The last squad,
led by Thomas, just arrived.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.920
They never saw those three.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.130
Huh?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.220
You don't think... they got lost?

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.350
Hey...

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.140
They don't stand a chance
if they're stuck in this blizzard.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.560
Shit!

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.850
Eren!

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.270
I'm going back out to try and find them!

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.440
Me, too.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.610
Everyone, get in the cabin.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.650
But... Christa and--

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.200
Yeah. We'll send a rescue team
first thing in the morning.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.030
It'll be too late by then!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.080
We won't make any more victims!

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.380
Shit.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.060
Christa.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.310
Christa, give it up.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.280
Listen to me.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.690
Never.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.820
Daz already has one foot in the grave.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.490
It's his own fault for doing
this training to boost his score

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.960
without knowing how much his body can take.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.880
He's just not cut out to be a soldier.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.510
If you keep crawling to the foot
of the mountain at this rate,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.130
he'll probably be a goner by then,
and we'd be lucky not to be.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.180
Which means there's only two outcomes.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.810
Leave Daz here and save ourselves,
or all three of us die.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.600
Which will it be?

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.310
You forgot one.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.360
That your prediction is entirely wrong.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.820
I'll be able to reach our base
at the foot of the mountain... with Daz.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.700
You can go ahead of us and get back safe.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.830
How about that?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.000
There's no trouble in it for you.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.580
We'll make it back for sure.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.460
Go ahead of us.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.770
Hey. Why haven't you
asked me to help at all?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.940
I think...

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.860
...you have no intention of saving Daz.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.710
You don't care. You've resigned
yourself to death already.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.130
You're hoping to die here, aren't you?

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.930
How could you?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.820
I thought you were a good girl.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.600
You've gotta at least make it look like
you're trying to save his life.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.140
If you want people to remember you as a

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.340
hero who died trying to save someone,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.520
don't drag him down with you.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.650
That's what a bad girl would do.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.990
You're wrong!

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.870
I didn't...

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.740
That's not...

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.710
I...

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.460
It's you, right? The mistress' daughter
who had people after your life.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.510
How do you know?

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.050
I see...

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.180
So it was you after all.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.290
It's something I happened to overhear.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.960
At a church in the interior,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.490
back when I snuck around 
borrowing things to stay alive.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.150
What a sob story it was.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.950
An illegitimate child
can't succeed a powerful noble.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.550
So they just wanted to kill her,
to end all the fuss once and for all.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.830
But they'd look aside if she changed
her name and lived a humble life.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.300
In the end, I heard the girl was forced
to join the Cadet Corps.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.580
Don't you worry.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.180
I haven't told anyone. 
I don't plan to either.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.030
Then...

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.680
...did you enter the Cadet 
Corps just to find me?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.060
If that's the case... why?

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.420
Who knows. Maybe because we're similar.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.650
What?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.300
You and me... have similar backgrounds?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.410
Well, more or less.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.920
That's the reason you became a soldier?

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.500
Could be. I don't really know.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.170
No, it's not.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.220
You wanted...

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.610
...to become friends with me?

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.060
Huh? You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.560
You and I can't even compare.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.060
We both got a second chance at life.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.440
But I'm not the one who took on a fake name.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.150
If I abandon my name
and reject who I am, they win.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.700
I'm going to keep the name I have
and make the best of my life.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.580
That's the one and only way
I can get my revenge.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.240
So how do you explain yourself?

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.290
Are you gonna commit suicide

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.090
and make everyone who ruined your life happy?

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.210
Why is your desire to kill aimed at yourself?

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.420
If you're so eager, use that passion
to change your own fate!

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.930
I... I can't...

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.880
Even now...

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.680
There's no way the three of us
can make it out of here alive.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.190
There is.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.270
Huh?

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.330
I can see the base straight down from here.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.620
We drop Daz off this cliff.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
What?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.200
Hopefully he survives the fall,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.520
and hopefully someone down there finds him.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.620
Sure, it might be a long shot, but...

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.590
...that's his only real chance now.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.390
Unless some miracle happens,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.260
he'll be an icicle long 
before you drag him down.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.350
But...

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.770
But he'll die for sure if he falls!

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.600
Shut up!

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.190
Huh?

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.570
Quit it!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.480
Ymir!

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.610
I'll do it myself, so get moving already!

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.430
It can't be...

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.550
Wait!

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.930
Ymir, wait!

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.980
They're both...

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.110
...gone.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.780
It's better if you guys don't come along.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.370
Like our instructor said, you'll only
end up becoming more victims.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.920
I'm going so that doesn't happen.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.170
I'm not leaving Christa and the others.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.910
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.010
Don't try to stop--

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.300
You're gonna need a lot more gear than that.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.220
If you go by yourselves,
you'll be in the same pickle as Christa.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.600
In a search, the more eyes, the better.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.520
You guys...

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.900
Thanks.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.610
To be honest, we could use you.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.650
Hey.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.330
We're coming too.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.570
The weather's steadily improving.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.780
I think we'll be fine.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.410
I brought extra rations!

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.550
You guys...

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.920
What was that sound just now?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.180
Somebody's coming!

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.780
Ymir...

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.500
Took you long enough.
I got here before you.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.550
I told Reiner and the others I'd wait
since you'd come along eventually.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.750
What a stupid thing I've done...

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.250
Where's Daz?

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.050
That was the cliff?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.970
But you didn't have any rope.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.440
Even if you did, it's too high.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.480
How did you get Daz down from there?

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.640
Why not?

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.450
I think I can trust you.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.200
However...

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.270
Promise me.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.210
When I reveal my secret 
to everyone, promise me.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.800
Take back your old name and live.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.230
Ymir!

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.530
Christa... I felt the same.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.530
That it would have been better
if I was never born at all.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.530
I was hated by the world just for existing.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:49.970
I...

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.370
To give countless people 
joy, I gave up my life.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.240
But from that time,
there was a wish I held in my heart.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:03.170
If someday, I was given
a second chance at life...

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.430
...this time...

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.180
...I would live for no one but myself!

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Winter Training"

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.980
"As Titans are most active in sunlight,
 blizzards can hinder their speed.
 Soldiers able to move freely and swiftly in
 such poor conditions gain considerable odds for victory."

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.240
Is this real?

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.380
Ymir is a Titan, too?

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.960
Ymir...

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.170
Th-That Titan is...

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.550
...from that day...

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.310
Th-Thanks, Reiner.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.990
Ow, it hurts! Reiner, my leg!

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.080
Reiner! That's enough!

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.830
Let her leg go! Her leg!

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.660
Hey!

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.410
S-Sorry.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.140
No, you saved me.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.270
Christa... Did you know?

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.780
That Ymir is a Titan?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.180
I had no idea.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.810
I was always so close to her, too.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.290
How? How could this be?

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.330
That Titan... is Ymir?

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.350
In other words, she knew
some of the secrets of our world.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.970
And I never suspected a thing.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.040
Hey... Do you think she's known about it?

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.270
Eren's a Titan, too,
but he didn't know until it happened.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.820
But Ymir is like... she is aware
of being a Titan all along.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.130
Are you saying she might be
an enemy of humanity?

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.100
I'm saying that's one 
hell of a power to hide.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.680
Who knows what she might have been thinking.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.540
I wonder... What could be Ymir's goal?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.360
Ymir!

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.810
She's--

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.730
Wh-What was that?

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.710
Is she worried about the tower falling?

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.270
She has to be.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.440
If she wanted to,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.750
Ymir could use this power
of hers to escape all on her own.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.850
And yet, she's not doing that.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.910
It's us... She's risking 
her life to protect us.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.040
Why?

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.920
Why?

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.650
Ymir!

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.350
Don't you die, Ymir!

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.220
Not in a place like this!

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.310
Hey!

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.310
Don't pretend like you're good, you idiot!

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.690
You wanna go out in a blaze of glory?
Are you stupid?!

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.570
It's too late for you to try
and get into heaven!

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.630
Live for yourself, goddammit!

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.580
If you're gonna die protecting 
this tower, forget about it!

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.820
Tear it down!

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.620
Hey!

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.640
H-Hey! She's really tearing it down!

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.850
Keep it up, Ymir!

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.940
Want live...?

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.270
Grab me!

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.730
Titans again?

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.810
Hey, ugly! Go and finish the job!

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.480
Ymir!

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.620
This looks bad.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.850
Ymir is...

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.190
This can't...

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.640
This can't...

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.730
Christa!

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.730
This can't...

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.510
Ymir, wait!

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.440
I still...

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.490
...want to talk to you!

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.280
I still--

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.330
I still haven't told you my real name!

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.250
Wait...

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.610
I still...

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.150
Christa. Everyone, get back.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.900
We've got this.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.400
Leave the rest to us.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:40.820
Mikasa!

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.210
Have the others disperse and cover the area!

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.840
The rest of us will attack
where the Titans are gathering!

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.670
Got it!

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.210
Hey!

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.730
We don't need you to be a part of the attack!

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.230
Die!

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.180
I did it! My first kill!

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.520
You moron! I told you to stay back, Eren!

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.050
Right! I'm sorry!

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.940
Ouch...

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.820
Hey!

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:21.720
Eren!

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.750
You guys!

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.500
It can't be...

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.000
Ymir is...

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.660
Ymir...

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.680
My real name...

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.490
...is Historia.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.450
There was no damage seen along Wall Rose.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.470
Then how is it that Titans appeared
on the inside of the wall?

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.160
Thrown into confusion,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.090
the Scouts decide to return to

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.830
Trost with doubts weighing 
heavily on their mind.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.560
However...

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:04.300
...Eren learns a shocking secret--
one that changes everything.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.560
"Warrior"

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.980
Next episode: "Warrior."
