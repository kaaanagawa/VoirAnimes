WEBVTT

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.080
I can win!

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.530
Against Reiner, I can win!

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.200
Hey...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.740
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.950
Above you! Look out!

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.820
Eren!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.970
"The Hunters"

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.070
"Trost District"

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.580
Commander.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.370
Wake up, Commander Pyxis.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.750
You'll get sick if you fall asleep here.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.880
I can't believe you drank all this.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.790
You're not young anymore.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.760
And I'd rather not spend my days
changing your diapers.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.220
Being cared for by a pretty lady
sounds all right to me.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.820
So? What's the situation?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.080
Patrols were sent out once the Titans

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.320
were gone from the 1st and 2nd defensive lines,

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.980
but any Titan sightings are few and far between.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.910
Hmm...

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.610
If Hannes and the advance squad
followed the wall without problem,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.780
they'll be returning any minute now.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.170
"Krolva District"               "Trost District"
"Hannes' Advance Squad"

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.640
It would mean they met the unit from
Krolva District and turned around halfway.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.800
And they couldn't have encountered
many Titans, if any.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.180
If there was a hole in the wall,
it would never work out like that.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.670
Commander Pyxis.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.480
Hmm?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.350
Oh. If it isn't Erwin.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.650
I hear you've captured
one of those troublesome mice.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.820
Yes.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.490
Unfortunately, we were one step behind.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.100
Hmm...

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.620
But at least it will get those goons
in the interior thinking.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.620
Maybe they'll reconsider how important
their stale beliefs and motives are to them.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.400
Yes, it appears they have.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.220
Look over there.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.260
The Military Police have finally been
forced into an area with Titans.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.760
Can't believe we didn't see any Titans.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.600
Was there really none at all?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.770
Seems so. It's unusually quiet out there.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.650
I wonder if they're still alive...

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.070
Can you believe it?
I thought this was an emergency.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.450
Yeah. And everyone's just sitting around here.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.800
Hey, Levi. Where you hiding the Titans at?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.620
Oh? You all seem so disappointed.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.410
Sorry... A shame you couldn't fight Titans today.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.200
If you're looking for another chance,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.630
there's plenty of expeditions outside the walls.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.390
How about we join forces
and face some Titans together?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.520
Uh, well you know...

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.980
We're busy with work on the interior...

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.730
The advance squad's returned!

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.980
Inform Commander Pyxis!

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.440
I see...

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.870
So there was nothing wrong with the wall?

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:31.870
Yes, sir!

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.660
As I suspected...

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.210
H-However, there's a bit of a situation!

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.790
We were heading back to Trost to give our report

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.670
when we ran into the Scout unit
led by Section Commander Hange.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.010
Along with them, there were recruits
from the 104th without their equipment.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.930
And it turns out, three of them...

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.020
...were Titans!

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.480
What are you talking about?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.490
Are you saying there were more?!

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.860
Th-Three more of them?!

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.490
Who was it?!

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.780
U-Uh, well...

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.970
Jean, relax.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.450
What happened when their forms were revealed?

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.700
The Scouts engaged the Colossal
and Armored Titan in battle.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.620
But by the time we joined up with them to fight...

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.380
...it was all over.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.480
Unbelievable. What a disaster.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.110
Luckily we were above so we got away unscathed.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.480
Everyone underneath got blasted by steam and wind.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.520
There's nothing they could do.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.290
How's Mikasa doing?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.040
I don't see any bad wounds,
so I'm guessing it's a concussion.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.910
I see...

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.620
Armin... You haven't eaten, have you?

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.260
I'll get you something.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:18.480
You've gotta eat.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.940
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Field Rations"

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.940
"An extremely nutritious ration utilized by the Scout Regiment.
High calorie crackers and canned food are staple rations which
can quickly provide soldiers with the necessary energy for their
 operations without the need for a fire.
 The flavor has been refined so that the taste isn't bad."

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.470
Mikasa!

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.330
Mikasa! It's Eren!

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080
What happened to Eren?!

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.550
It's those three bullies again.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.800
They took some bread I bought from me.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.250
So he went on his own to get--

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.590
I tried to stop him!

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.850
Wait!

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.350
Give it back!

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.710
I thought I told you already.
There's none left 'cause I ate it.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.860
Got it?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.860
That was three days' worth
of food for his family!

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.280
You gotta be kidding me. Those table scraps?

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.460
Quit it, man. I feel bad now.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.780
If you're fine with vomit, I'll give it back.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.170
Pay him back for what you took!

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.550
Hey! Knock it off!

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.880
Hey!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.180
You drunk, good-for-nothing soldiers!

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.840
Come and break up this fight!

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.930
Put a sock in it.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.430
Can't you see the kids are just fooling around?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.450
Like hell they're fooling around!
Come and stop 'em!

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.020
It'll be fine, I'm telling ya.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.980
Someone will be along
who can help more than we can.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.490
Huh?!

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.110
Eren!

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.660
Eat this!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.960
It's Mikasa!

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.170
Mikasa! Why are you here?!

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.240
Eren, if you don't get home and chop wood,
your mother will get angry again.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.610
You little... Don't underestimate me!

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:25.430
You asked for it!

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.730
Eren!

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.980
Let Mikasa handle this!

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.560
Yeah, right!

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.070
Nice one, Eren!

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.000
Don't lose to Mikasa!

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.530
The hell you doing?!

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.740
I told you to stop the fight,
you damn freeloaders!

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.110
What was that?!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.330
Wanna say that again?!

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.290
Damn straight I will! You're a waste of taxes!

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.620
You son of a--!

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.460
Don't let it get to you.
It's the truth whether you like it or--

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.010
Heh.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.780
That was a pretty good punch
for a chump who runs a stall.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.610
Get 'em! Knock his lights out, Hannes!

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.950
You've got this!
Don't let that useless turd beat you!

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.110
Hey, you idiots! What the hell are you doing?!

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.280
--Cut it out!

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.450
--Give it back!
--Cut it out!

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.920
Damn it!

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.760
Knock it off!

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.590
Hey! This is turning pretty serious, you guys!

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.470
Forget it! Let's scram!

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.440
Wait right there!

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:49.770
Wait!

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.940
Eren! I don't care about the bread anymore!

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:53.730
Thanks for trying!

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.820
Eren. We should get back home, too.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.360
Go home without me!

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.190
Eren!

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.320
Stop right there!

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.180
Eren! Wait!

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.480
Eren!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.600
Mikasa?

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.560
Armin! Where's Eren?!

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.310
Mikasa, calm down!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.900
You shouldn't be moving!

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.060
We don't know how badly you're injured!

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.950
Where is he?!

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.790
Eren was taken away.

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.600
Ymir, too, by Bertholdt and Reiner.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.710
Eren, he...

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.720
...he lost to the Armored Titan.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.010
It's been five hours since then.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.240
Is anyone...

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.980
Is anyone chasing them?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.650
No...

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.110
Why not?!

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.680
All the horses are on the other side of the wall.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.140
In order to rescue Eren,

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.940
we have to wait for lifts to come so we can move the horses.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.980
There's nothing we can do.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.220
Section Commander Hange and
the other officers are too injured to move.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.720
To even send out a small scouting party,
we're going to need more soldiers than this.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.790
Soldiers with experience.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.320
Understand?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.070
Not this again...

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.970
Does it hurt somewhere?

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.490
No...

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.900
I must've hit my head pretty hard, but I'm fine.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.510
But...

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.500
When Eren was taken away by Annie...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.380
...I chased them right away.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.750
And fighting alongside
Captain Levi, in the end...

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.620
...in the end, we were able to get him back.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.330
But... if it's already been five hours...

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.030
Hey, Armin.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.100
Why?

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.910
Why does Eren always go
somewhere far away from us?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.840
Yeah, now that you mention it...

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:09.050
Eren has always run off on his own,
leaving us behind...

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.710
I guess that's just the way things
are meant to happen...

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.460
for Eren at least.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.620
But all I want... is to be at his side.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.080
That's all I ask for...

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.960
Mikasa? So you're up, huh?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.450
I bet you're hungry. Here, eat this.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.530
Armin, catch.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.420
As usual, field rations are all there is.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.230
Hmm...

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.820
Taste neither good nor bad. Same as always.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.040
Speaking of which,
this is the same as always, too.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.690
Ever since the good old days, you two have been there

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.090
to clean up the mess of that brat.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.050
That's what I call a lousy relationship. Sheesh.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.230
It's a different time and a different place,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.600
but you kids are doing the same thing you always have.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:39.190
Am I right?

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:46.150
The neighborhood bullies and Titans
are a little bit different in size.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:52.150
True... The thing is, that brat isn't
even all that good at fighting.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.870
But no matter if he's up against three or five,
he'll charge in all the same.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.750
By the time Mikasa or soldiers showed up,
he'd been beaten into a pulp every time.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.370
But you know...

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.290
I've never seen him win a fight before,

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.430
but I've never seen him get beat and give up either.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.770
Sometimes he's so tenacious
that even I think it's scary.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.140
No matter how many times
he's knocked over, he gets back up.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.220
That's the kinda guy he is.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.920
You think he'll get taken away
without putting up a fight?

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.380
Nope. He'll keep resisting
as long as he has strength.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.260
Even more so when he's up against just two.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.000
He'll give 'em hell no matter who he's up against.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.610
Until you or I show up to help.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.250
That's how Eren's always been.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.720
I loved those good old days.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.110
If you ask Eren, he'd say those days
were nothing more than a false peace.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.770
But for me, I'm more than happy
to be a drunk, useless soldier.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.900
If it means getting back to
those plain, ordinary days...

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.420
...I'll do whatever I have to.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.310
No matter how long it takes to get there.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.240
I'm coming, too.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:29.080
Without you three together again,
I can't bring back the good old days.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.940
They're here!

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.280
Hey!

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.490
Isn't that...?

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.580
Commander Erwin!

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.870
And the Military Police!

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.210
I never thought they'd ride along the wall.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:16.440
That's probably the quickest route.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.480
Christa...

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.850
I'd prefer if you stayed back, but...

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.770
No matter what you say, I won't.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.240
I refuse to wait here when Ymir was taken away.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.550
You two should know how I feel.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.730
Christa has a point, Armin.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.180
We have plenty of reasons
for chasing after them.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.910
One of which I still can't believe...

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.370
That Reiner and Bertholdt are our enemies.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.990
I've gotta hear it straight from their mouths.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.160
You made it, Commander Erwin!

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.590
Is the situation the same?

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.420
Yes, sir!

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.680
Good.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.930
Deploy the lifts!

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:05.940
Hange?!

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:07.850
Moblit...

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.390
G-Gimme a map.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.400
It might be a long shot,
but there's a giant forest here.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.030
We should head straight for it.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.100
Though, it's not like they have a way
to hide the Armored Titan's footsteps, but...

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.340
...I think that's where they're headed.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:29.870
Why's that?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.630
It's a gamble, but even if they have
the strength to change into Titans,

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.380
the other Titans outside
the wall might still be a threat.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.470
Especially after all that fighting.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.840
They might not be as bad off as Eren,
but I'm sure they're exhausted.

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.580
Like how Annie was out cold for a while.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.220
Let's assume for now that their

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.400
destination is somewhere outside of Wall Maria.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.190
Considering the distance they'll have to cover,

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.430
we can assume they'll need
to recover their stamina.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.270
Which means...

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.000
they'll want to rest somewhere
where Titans are unable to reach them.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.410
At least until nightfall when Titans can't move.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.700
Oh, Eren...

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.110
You're awake?

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.120
We have until night!

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.490
If we reach the forest before nightfall,
we still might make it in time!

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.610
Let's move!

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.030
Eren wakes up within the giant forest.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.830
Desperate to escape,

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.110
Eren attempts to transform once again, but is stopped by Ymir.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:57.830
Deep in the isolated forest, the emotions
of Eren and Reiner violently clash.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.020
They must settle things once and for all.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.220
Not only for themselves,
but for all those who've died.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:11.470
"Opening"

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.850
Next episode: "Opening."
