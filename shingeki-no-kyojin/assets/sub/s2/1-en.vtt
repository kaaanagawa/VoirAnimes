WEBVTT

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.780
The walls gave the people
a century of peace and security.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.710
The terror of being at their mercy

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.230
and the humiliation of being 
trapped became a distant memory.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.280
Until...

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.820
The battle for humanity's survival

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.570
began the moment the 
Titans breached the wall.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.760
After innumerable casualties
among soldiers and civilians alike,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.930
it was learned that some Titans
were hiding among the humans.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.260
Finally, five years after 
the first wall fell,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.750
humans succeeded in capturing one of
these disguised Titans: Annie Leonhart.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.440
Nevertheless...

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.370
...the next threat to humanity
was already close at hand.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.300
Hey!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.340
Look!

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.180
A Titan?!

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.480
In the wall?!

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.850
It can't be!

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.730
Your orders, Section Commander?

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.860
Huh? What? Hold on!

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.850
Was that there just by coincidence?

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.740
Or does this mean...?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.790
Pastor Nick?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.040
Whatever you do...

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.300
...you <i>must</i> keep that 
Titan out of the sunlight!

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.420
Huh?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.980
"Beast Titan"

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.630
For now, we've covered
the Wall Titan with sheets.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.990
We'll take more proper measures after sunset.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.420
I see.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.000
What are we supposed to make of this, Sir?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.540
I never imagined there were
Titans in the walls...

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.750
No one did.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.220
There were only people who knew,
and people who didn't.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.390
What's the deal?!

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.510
We just fought a Titan here.
Why are they keeping us in the dark?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.810
Business as usual.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.020
But what's scummiest of all...

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.340
...is that there's no "official" reason
why all these people died.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.530
Now then,

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.180
it's time for you to talk.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.610
What is this Titan?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.180
What is it doing inside the wall?

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.370
And... why did you people
keep this a secret all this time?

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.060
I have work to do!

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.900
My church and followers have been devastated!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.230
This is your fault! I 
<i>will</i> demand restitution!

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.940
Now let me back down!

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.110
Certainly.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.990
Will straight down do?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.370
Section Commander!

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.260
Stay back.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.160
Enough of this!

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.290
Do you people know why we Scouts
have shed so much blood?!

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.920
To take back our freedom from the Titans!

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.860
I was willing to sacrifice
my own life for that cause!

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.160
I'm not asking you to talk,
I'm ordering you. Is that clear?

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.220
And if you won't talk, 
I'll try the next person.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.530
<i>Your</i> measly life wouldn't
make up for much, anyway!

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.200
Let... go of me!

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.390
Like this? Right now?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.790
Yes!

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.330
Fine, then. Die.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.200
Section Commander!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.960
Kill me and learn!

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.350
We <i>will</i> fulfill our duty, without fail!

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.130
So...

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:52.300
...let go of me this instant!

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.060
Deliver me... O Lord...

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.570
Just kidding. I wasn't serious.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.590
Tell me, Pastor Nick...

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.080
Are <i>all</i> the walls made of Titans?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.230
Section Commander...

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.040
Whew, I forgot how this feels.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.470
I haven't felt this way since
my first time outside the walls.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.030
Talk about terrifying...

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.360
Hurry! Inform Commander Erwin!

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.110
Hurry!

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.840
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.630
"12 hours earlier"

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.430
"South of Wall Sina"

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:24.190
My village isn't far south 
of here, you know...

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.690
My hometown is close by, too...

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.130
Damn. Why can't I go visit?

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.950
Maybe I'll sneak out at night.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:40.910
They told me not to come 
back until I'm normal.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.670
They told <i>me</i> I was too puny to be a soldier.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.880
Was <i>genius</i> enough to be one, though.
I was in our class' top ten.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.630
I'm gonna go make 'em eat their words.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.050
Conny. If you're serious, I'll help.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.760
What? How come?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.100
Doesn't it seem strange?

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.020
We're on standby in our plain clothes,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.110
and we're not allowed to train
or wear our uniforms.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.110
Even more suspicious...

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.440
...is that everyone else is fully armed.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.090
We're inside the wall, not on the front line.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.280
Who are we fighting?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.830
Well, there <i>are </i>bears in the area.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.790
Yeah. Bears.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.850
Guns are enough to handle bears.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.720
I hear thuds! They sound like footsteps!

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.060
Huh?

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.600
Get serious, Sasha.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.980
If you're suggesting there are Titans here...

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.150
...that'd mean Wall Rose has fallen.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.250
Miche?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.990
Tomas! Take three couriers and go!

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.660
Huh?

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.460
Notify each district!

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.290
There are likely no Titans among
the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.210
Multiple Titans from the south!

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.590
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.600
It's the truth! I really hear footsteps!

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.470
Everyone here?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.020
Nanaba?

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.600
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.980
They're coming right this way.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.530
There's no time for you to gear up.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:40.530
Take your horses and evacuate
all nearby homes and settlements.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.970
Understood?

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.740
From... the south?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.380
<i>Has</i> the wall been breached?!

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.750
Get going! Lunch will 
have to wait, I'm afraid!

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.510
Miche.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.390
There are nine in that swarm up ahead.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.940
They've broken through Wall Rose.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.780
We never managed to uncover the Titans' secrets
or figure out what they are.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.730
And now the day has come.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.100
Humanity...

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.410
...has lost.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.970
No. Not yet.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.000
Only when a person stops 
fighting do they lose.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.640
As long as we continue to fight,
we are not beaten!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.440
As soon as the Titans reach the woods,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.610
we'll split into four teams
of recruits and soldiers alike,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.330
and then simultaneously scatter
in each direction!

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.580
Avoid combat when possible
and focus on getting the word out!

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.210
Is anyone familiar with this region?!

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.210
M-Me!

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.840
My town's north of here!

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.170
I know the lay of the land well!

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.380
And... so does Conny!

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.680
Conny?!

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.890
My village...

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.810
My village is to the south...

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.310
...where the Titans are coming from.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.210
I can take you to the nearby 
villages. After that...

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.690
...please let me visit mine.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.940
All right.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.070
You'll guide the southern team.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.120
Yes, Sir!

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.580
I'll come with you, Conny.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:52.500
The south will be crawling with Titans.
It'll be the most dangerous.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.650
So? I was going to help you
sneak there anyway, remember?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.810
You coming, Bertholdt?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.430
Of course I'll come.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.430
As you may know,

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.680
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.440
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.150
The Titans have reached the woods!

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.490
Scatter!

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.000
Ride as fast as you can!

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.960
What?!

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.840
They all started sprinting!

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.840
Whoa! They're going to catch up!

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.760
Gerger!

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.560
Take charge of the southern team!

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.730
Sir?!

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.360
U-Understood.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.110
He's using himself as bait?!

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.070
He won't survive! I'll help!

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.350
No! We can't spare anyone else!

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.770
Have faith in him!

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.620
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.080
He'll make it back alive!

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:41.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Little is known about the Titans inside the walls.
They appear to form the walls with a material similar to the Female Titan's crystal." "The leaders of the Wall Cult seem to be aware of the truth, but remain wholly unforthcoming."

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.540
Oh, Eren.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.120
Did you get into <i>another</i> fight?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.630
Those jerks started it! They made fun of me!

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.120
So, I assume Mikasa had to
come to your rescue again?

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.020
Thanks.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.850
Eren.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.850
No matter how cruel someone is
or how much you hate them,

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.020
you can't always charge at them head-on!

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.730
You're a man!

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.780
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.390
That's...

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.460
It fell.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.780
You gotta be tired. Go get some sleep.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.010
Sorry. I'm fine.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.990
That thing's seen better days.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.020
I'll get you a new one
if I see any in our supplies.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.650
Eren! Mikasa!

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:48.110
This is really bad!

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.280
The Titans! They're inside Wall Rose!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.540
Ugh. Those damn Titans never give us a break.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.730
Can you go?

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.420
Not like there's much choice.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:13.170
It was wise to have
Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.270
I believe he can handle the situation.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:17.180
Yes.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.220
Let's hope so.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.880
Four left.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.470
No, it's time to go.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.350
I've bought enough time.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.390
Still...

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.740
...I <i>am</i> concerned about that Abnormal.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.980
It's different.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.990
It looks over 17 meters tall. It's huge...

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.740
And I've never seen
a Titan covered in fur before.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.860
It's just walking around
instead of coming for me.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.480
It's definitely an Abnormal, but...

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.090
Great! You're back!

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.250
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.470
It went for the horse?!

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.560
You can't be serious!

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.330
Wait.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:32.290
Huh? Didn't I just say to wait?

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.000
Tell me, what is that weapon called?

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.390
That thing on your waist that flies around.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.900
I'm certain we speak the same language.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.900
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.690
Oh, I see you use swords, too.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.540
I guess that means you know
we reside in the nape.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.360
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.450
Only when a person stops 
fighting do they lose.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:11.910
As long as we continue to fight...

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.440
...we are not beaten!

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.430
You can move now.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.980
No! No!

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.480
Stop! Don't! No! No!

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.670
So you <i>can</i> speak.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.960
I must say, what a clever idea.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.540
No! No!

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.880
Stop! No!

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.980
Titans have suddenly 
appeared inside Wall Rose.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.220
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.330
scatter across the land to spread the news.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:56.290
Meanwhile, Eren and the others
head to their rescue.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.710
And after returning to her hometown,

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.360
Sasha comes face-to-face with her past.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.290
Next episode: "I'm Home."

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:11.560
"I'm Home"
