WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.100
Again?!

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.750
What the hell is that sound?!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.400
While stopped at the ruins
of Utgard Castle to take a brief break,

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.160
the Scouts were overwhelmed by a Titan assault,
vanquishing their hope of survival.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.370
--Nanaba...
--No! No!

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.540
--And Gelgar...
--No! No!

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.870
Father, stop!

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.630
However, in that moment...

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.210
Christa.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.400
This is nothing more than a hope of mine...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.620
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.180
Ymir! Wait!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.980
...Ymir suddenly transformed into a Titan.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.900
Keep it up, Ymir!

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.770
Want live...?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.360
Grab me!

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.370
This looks bad.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.160
Ymir is...

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.960
This can't...

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.960
This can't...

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.010
I still haven't told you my real name!

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.140
And then the main force of the Scouts
rushed in to engage the enemy.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.680
Die!

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.060
They successfully dismantled 
the Titan attack.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.420
However,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.120
upon the ruins of battle,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.030
Eren and the others learn a surprising truth.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.960
Ymir...

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.210
My real name...

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.130
...is Historia.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.980
"Warrior"

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.290
Slowly!

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.380
Bring it up slowly!

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.420
Raise it carefully now!

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.640
How's Ymir?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.270
What sort of shape is she in?

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.940
Her right arm and leg were bitten off,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.060
and her insides are beaten like scrambled eggs.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.200
If she was normal, she'd be dead for sure.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.870
If she was normal, huh?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.670
Reiner! Grab on!

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.950
Right!

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.010
Please, believe me!

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.510
I'm telling the truth!

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.390
Ymir transformed into a Titan
to fight off the other Titans and save us!

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.500
She did so with no regard for her own life,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.940
which proves her loyalty to us, her comrades!

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.610
It's true that her judgement
until now is unforgivable.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.670
After all, she may know things useful
to humanity and yet she kept quiet about it!

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.950
I imagine she didn't say anything
in order to protect herself.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.250
But... now she's a changed person!

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.160
Ymir is an ally of humanity!

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.510
I know Ymir better than anybody.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.480
She's a much simpler person than she looks!

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.630
I see.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.640
Obviously, I hope we can build
a trusting relationship with her.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.010
Her judgement aside, the information
she holds is a treasure for humanity.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.610
I hope we get along.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.580
But you know...

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.960
...even if she is a simple person,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.790
this world becomes more of a
confusing mess with every passing day.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.670
You said... your real 
name was Historia Reiss?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.660
Yes, that's right.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.760
Reiss, as in that noble family?

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.420
Yes.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.240
I see.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.980
Nice to meet you, Historia.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.690
Yeah...

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.320
How's Ymir?

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.070
She's still in a coma.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.140
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think
steam is coming out of her wounds.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.430
For now, take her back to Trost
so she can get some proper medical care.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.970
She's in your hands.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.330
Understood.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.090
Now then...

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.990
Our original mission... 
was to seal this wall.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.200
Damn, it hurts.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.190
You all right, Reiner?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.160
Not by a long shot.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.490
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.530
That was... pathetic.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.410
I thought I was done for.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.680
Even someone as strong as you
gets this way sometimes.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.910
What are you talking about?
This is the second time for me!

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.220
Tell him, Armin.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.420
Huh?

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.440
Remember the time I almost
got crushed in that Titan's hand?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.230
Oh...

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.160
Back then...

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.680
That makes twice I've nearly died.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.680
At this rate, I'll be dead before I know it.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.240
I picked this path on my own,
but being a soldier is rough.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.990
It's like a soldier's spirit
breaks down before their body.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.340
Though, until we plug up this wall,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.880
there's no time to waste whining about it.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.680
Yeah.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.840
You two have been driven
far enough away from your hometown.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.690
I'm thinking... this is where
we gotta draw the line.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.920
He's right, Reiner!

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.480
Our hometown! Let's return!

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.950
Isn't it about time to go back?

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.320
Compared to all the trouble we've
been through, what's left to do is nothing!

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.020
That's right.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.080
We're so close, it's just
another few steps till the end.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.830
Huh?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.490
What are you guys talking about?

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.090
Thanks, Mikasa.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.450
Are you hurt?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.380
I'm fine, but... Reiner got his arm bit
and Ymir is as you can see.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.420
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:04.640
Does that--?

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.190
Sasha.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.840
Is everyone clear?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.360
We'll deal with Ymir later.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.030
And Conny...

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.660
I'll arrange for a Scout squad
to investigate your village later.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.460
For the time being, I want you to focus
on the mission to fix the wall.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.710
Got it?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.700
Got it!

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.540
Still... I expected this place
to be swarming with Titans.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:32.900
Hannes?

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.850
It's the Garrison's advance squad.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.390
They came to tell us where the hole is.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.600
There's no hole anywhere!

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.080
Huh?

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.660
We spent all night looking for it...

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:57.240
...but at least between Trost and Krolva District,
there's nothing wrong with the wall.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.490
What'd you say?

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.450
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva
and retraced our steps.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.050
We haven't seen any Titans 
the whole way here.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.790
But... we know for sure there's Titans
on this side of the wall.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.340
Did you actually look?
Are you sure you're not drunk?

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.670
I didn't drink!

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.260
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.480
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.650
For now, we're falling 
back to Trost District!

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.590
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.220
We're going back ahead of you.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.620
There's nothing wrong with the wall?

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.650
What could this mean?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.180
There's been nothing like this in five years.
Why is it all happening now?

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.140
This world is getting more 
and more out of hand.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.670
Eren.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.340
Have a minute?

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.100
We need to talk.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.100
What about?

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.990
Five years ago, we demolished the wall
and began our attack on humanity.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.910
Oh no... What if there's a Titan
that dug a hole underneath the wall?

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.740
The hole will be hard to find in that case.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.250
I'm the Armored Titan
and he's the Colossal Titan.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.290
Right now, we need to focus
on getting Ymir back safely.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.950
Even with our horses,
we still have to worry about Titans.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.120
Huh?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.170
What are you talking about?

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.470
Why are you telling him, Reiner?

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.950
Our primary goal was to ensure
all of humanity was wiped out,

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.400
but now there's no need for that.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.230
Uh...

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.370
Eren.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:58.110
If you agree to come with us, we won't
have to destroy any more of the walls.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.530
Understand?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:01.610
Huh?

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.950
No, wait! I don't understand at all!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.360
I'm saying... Why don't 
you just come with us?

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Lifts"

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.960
"Lifts are used to carry objects and materials over the walls.
 They are easily transported and assembled and are built in
 such a way to facilitate emergency  and tactical deployment.
 Their weight is minimized for this purpose."

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.470
I know this is sudden, but we need to go now.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.350
Right now? Where will you take me?

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.040
I can't say that yet.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.180
But... Well, it's something 
like our hometown.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.190
So? What will it be, Eren?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:38.860
Uh...

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.680
It's not a bad deal, right?

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.960
You can easily avert this crisis.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.780
I wonder about that...

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.300
Hey! We're leaving!

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.130
What the hell?

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.260
And here I thought I had
enough to think about yesterday...

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.520
"12 hours earlier"

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.520
Eren?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.100
"Ehrmich District"

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.310
What is it, Section Commander?

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.310
Oh, well...

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:22.860
I was finally able to get my hands on
the background report for Annie Leonhart.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.530
Annie's?

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.200
Yeah.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.790
It's taken so long to get it because managing
these reports is such a mess right now.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.160
According to this,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.770
there were two others belonging to the

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.980
104th Cadet Corps who came from the same area as her.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.600
And those two are...

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.970
...Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.730
Thanks to the chaos five years ago,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.010
pretty much all of their family records are spotty or missing.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.360
However...

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:10.120
During the long-range scouting formation,
their unit was given false information.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.350
They were among those purposely told
that Eren was in the right wing.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.250
The Female Titan attacked 
from the right wing!

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.420
Huh? What does that mean?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.720
That it's possible they passed on
that information to Annie...

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.720
Why? Why would they tell Annie?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.590
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.510
You can't just--

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.850
I know that, Eren.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.110
By itself, that's not 
enough to prove anything.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.050
So just in case, I'd like to hear from you
how these three interacted during training.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.320
Know anything?

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.820
I knew Reiner and Bertholdt
were from the same place, but...

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.570
...they didn't seem close to Annie.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.780
I agree.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.080
I don't recall ever seeing the pair
talking to Annie that much.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:00.830
Well, Annie didn't talk 
much in the first place.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.110
When we ate, Annie would always sit alone
and munch on food by herself.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.550
Oh! I've got something!

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.430
I heard a rumor she liked sweets,
even though she looks so grouchy!

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.200
I...

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.310
don't remember.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.850
But...

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.580
As their comrade,
I'd find it hard to believe.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.440
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:29.390
Reiner is like everyone's big brother,
and he's not devious enough to deceive all of us.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.510
I agree.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.040
Reiner gave everything he had
fighting the Female Titan with me.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.220
He would have gotten crushed
in her hand if he hadn't--

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.580
What's wrong?

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.430
Reiner managed to escape, but...

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.300
...Annie suddenly changed her course...

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.590
...and ran in the direction of Eren.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.210
I...

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.970
I did mention that Eren might be
at the rear of the center rank.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.600
But Annie was too far away to hear...

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.980
Seriously?

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.610
Did Reiner seem overly interested
in Eren's location?

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.650
Then... Where the hell is Eren?

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.790
It can't be...

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.200
I only started talking 
about Eren's position...

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.590
...because Reiner was the one
who asked about it first.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.880
Furthermore...

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.810
...when that happened, the Female
Titan was staring at her palm.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.060
He might have written a message
with his blades in her hand.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.400
Reiner could've...

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.240
What the hell?

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.820
Why are you saying things like this?

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.660
--You should--

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.270
--Eren!
--You should--

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.620
No... Everyone, listen up!

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.680
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.380
act in such a way as to not reveal any suspicions.

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:12.990
Of course, do not make any mention
of Annie Leonhart either.

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.640
Regardless if they're 
Annie's accomplices or not,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.890
we need to lead them
deep underground and confine them.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.270
Does everyone understand?

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.930
Yes!

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.030
You're just tired, aren't you?

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.240
Right, Bertholdt?

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.310
You've been through so much,
it's making you crazy.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.700
Y-Yeah.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.540
Reiner's just really tired.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.120
Besides, if you were really the Armored Titan
that wants to destroy humanity...

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.050
...why would you be asking me
this in the first place?

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:59.210
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.830
Oh, right.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.590
That's right.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.500
What the hell was I thinking?

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.080
Have I really gone crazy?

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.790
Come on, let's go.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.410
I see...

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.420
That's it.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.170
I've been here too long for my own good.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.740
It's been three long years...

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.450
surrounded by nothing but idiots.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.450
We were just kids... We didn't know anything.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.690
If only I never knew that
there were people like this...

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.350
I...

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.380
...wouldn't have become...

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.060
...such a half-assed piece of shit!

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.440
It's too late now...
I don't know what's right anymore.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.050
But the only choice for me now...

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.410
...is to face the consequences 
of my actions...

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.570
...and as a warrior...

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.210
...fulfill my duty to the bitter end!

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.590
Reiner!

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.720
Are we doing it?! Now?! Right here?!

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:04.470
Yeah.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.090
We settle this... right here, right now!

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:21.740
Eren!

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.860
Run!

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.490
Bertholdt!

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.750
Eren! Get out of there!

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.020
Ymir!

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.590
Eren!

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.110
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.780
That's all I care about now.

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.860
Bertholdt...

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.270
Reiner...

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.020
You damn traitors!

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.270
The Colossal Titan...

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.120
...as well as the Armored Titan,
engage the Scouts in battle.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:57.120
If their mission is to exterminate all of humanity,
there is no turning back for them now.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:01.430
Reiner and the others devote
their lives to the mission...

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.960
...because they are warriors.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.560
