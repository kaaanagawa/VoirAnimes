00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.190
It's like the report said...

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.600
The entire village is devastated,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.740
and yet there's not a drop of blood,
let alone any bodies here.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.910
Then... the villagers of Ragako
were able to safely evacuate?

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.390
If that's the case,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.550
then the Titans were having
a field day in a completely empty village.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.760
That's hard to believe.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.210
Furthermore... why would they evacuate
without even taking a single horse?

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.550
Then what happened?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.360
What could this mean?

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.470
Moblit, I found one! This way!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.730
There you are...

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.270
Moblit, look at this.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.820
This is a portrait of 
Conny Springer's parents?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.680
It's a strong possibility.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.610
Kill it!

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.410
Wait! Hold up!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.000
Unbelievable...

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.030
"Children"

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.500
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.990
It's up to you to decide.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.370
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.940
Ymir!

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.210
Who knows...

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.990
It's settled then.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.200
Too bad, Eren.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.980
You're kidding...

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.850
The Scouts... are already...

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.520
Dammit!

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.140
Reiner. What are you right now?

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.340
Relax, I'm a warrior.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.460
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.240
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.640
Yeah, that's my point. 
Ymir's motive is clear.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.170
Once she turned human again,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.800
she probably roamed around
and lived only caring about herself.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.480
Until she met Christa...

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.780
And as cute as Christa is, we have
other reasons to bring her to our side.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.280
She's an important person
in a family of the Church.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.370
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate,
our job isn't over yet.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.720
Having Christa with us at that point
will make our search much easier.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.570
They're close.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.230
What are they talking about?

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.580
Are they planning to leave 
before the sun sets?

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.340
Let's bring an end to it.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.110
The next time we come here,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.960
we can take Annie, Christa, 
and that back home.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.300
That way we won't have to come here anymore.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.300
Right. And our mission will be over.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.540
But as for you...

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.020
When we get to our hometown,
tell Annie how you feel.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.690
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.940
You stare too much.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.940
Enough that everyone can tell.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.650
But I--

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.130
You should go for it.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.370
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.170
Who better to understand what
we've gone through than one of us?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.170
What's going on, Reiner?

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.040
Aren't we waiting until night?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.900
Nope. We're leaving now.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.380
Eren, don't try to resist.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.680
Come on, don't get violent with me.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.690
Look at the shape that I'm in.
Does it look like I can resist?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.910
Please, gimme a break.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.160
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.360
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.650
--I'll kill you!
--Hey. Why are we leaving already?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:07.760
--Let go!
--Ymir.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.480
When you turned back into a human,
do you remember the person you ate?

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.750
No, I don't remember...

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.580
But if it was five years ago...

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.640
Was it one of your comrades?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.990
I see...

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.350
Sorry... for not even remembering.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.090
It's not your fault for forgetting.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.300
It was the same for us, too.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.970
I see...

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.630
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.990
Is that how it works?

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.790
Do you resent me for it?

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.570
I'm not sure... I... don't know.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.280
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.940
How long were you wandering
outside the walls for?

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.180
About 60 years.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.010
It was like... I was stuck in
a nightmare that would never  end.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720
A red smoke signal.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.630
What?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.150
Commander! We're surrounded!

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.830
There's a way around!
Should we head towards it?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.820
No... Any detours and we'll be too late.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.240
We'll force our way through!
All soldiers, prepare for battle!

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.710
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.030
We need to get as far away as possible!

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.190
My Titan form isn't very fast.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.970
If I get surrounded,
I won't be able to protect you guys!

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.390
Then why didn't we just 
wait until nightfall?!

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.180
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to rescue us?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.910
Unless they brought loads 
of horses over the wall,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.190
that scouting formation won't work.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.810
Someone made that call...

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.840
I didn't think it would happen so soon.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.550
It must be Commander Erwin.
A tough opponent!

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.240
Shit... They're already that close?

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.200
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.290
It can't be...

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.560
She's...

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.520
No, she is!

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.260
Reiner! Christa's here!
Christa came with them!

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:56.890
Huh?!

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.350
If you want her, now's the chance!

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.930
How do you know? You can't see her from here!

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.060
I just know it!

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.260
She's such a good-natured 
person, it's stupid!

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.490
I guarantee she came to save me! I know it!

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.680
Even if that's true, it's no use!

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.190
We'll do it later!

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.490
Huh?!

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.780
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.620
How will you get Christa 
out of that formation?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.210
Wait for a chance!

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.700
Wait for a chance?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.380
Seriously? Will that be after
I'm eaten by one of your warriors?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.130
No! I don't trust you!

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.510
Trust me! Christa is 
indispensable to us, too!

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.220
Then get her now!
Go prove it to me this instant!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.640
It has to be now or never!

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.520
I want to see her right now!

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.050
At this rate...
I'll never get a chance...

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.260
to see her again.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.070
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Ymir's Hometown"

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.070
"It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located.
 However, its location is most certainly
 outside the confines of the walls."

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.200
It's impossible.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.080
I'm sorry, Ymir.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.550
We don't even know if we can escape 
ourselves, let alone go back for her.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.220
I promise you!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.920
If anyone, it's Christa I want
to save from this conflict!

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.290
You have to trust us! So just bear with it!

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.180
This is for Christa's 
own sake! Got it, Ymir?!

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.870
Is it... really for Christa's sake?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.250
Yeah!

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.760
Fine...

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.490
Thank you.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:41.040
It's happening again, Christa...

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.320
I've come this far...

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.510
...and yet it seems...

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.870
Will I have to lie to myself again?

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.750
Hey... Here's a promising one.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.350
How's this kid?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.370
Yeah.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.550
Hey, you there. You're going to
come live with us from now on.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.010
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.740
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.730
Understand?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.220
That day... was the first 
time I lied to myself.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.530
From that point on, I convinced myself...
that I never had a choice.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.250
But...

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.790
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits
the blood of the king.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:42.360
As long as Lady Ymir is with us,
we will be blessed with immortality.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.640
Lady Ymir!

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.160
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.620
My food wasn't cold anymore...

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.830
And neither was my bed off the ground.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.970
Lady Ymir.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.440
But more than all... was the feeling
of being needed by someone.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.080
I served a purpose in someone's life
for the first time ever.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.010
To me, that was more precious
than anything else.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.000
But then, one day...

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.570
It's her! She's the one who did it!

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:29.560
She told us she has the blood of the king!
All we did was believe her!

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.030
I was cruelly reminded
that everything in my life...

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:35.830
...was a lie.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.800
Is that right?

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.810
N-N--

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.660
It's true.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.300
I am Ymir! The blood of the king
runs through me!

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.050
And once again... I told more lies.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.390
If that's what it took 
to save everyone else...

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.890
However...

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.050
Things didn't work that way.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.390
No!

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.040
Stop... Please, stop! I'm begging you!

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.220
That's when I knew...

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.590
This was my punishment.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.680
It's not that I was being punished
for deceiving all those people.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.170
It was for convincing myself to believe...
to feel needed by someone.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.050
It's what I deserved for
continuing to lie to myself.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.440
This was my punishment.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.170
It's a Titan! Run!

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.250
When I opened my eyes...

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.470
...what I saw was freedom 
spread out before me.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.580
If there was such a thing as fate,
I can only laugh at how fickle it can be.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.840
And in that moment...

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.810
...I made a promise to myself.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.690
I was done with telling lies.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.580
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.100
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.690
So? What ever happened with that?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.200
She was given the name Christa Lenz
and sent off to become a cadet.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.410
What a pity. She would have been
better off not being born.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.540
Are you talking about me?!

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.710
Come on, now. It makes no difference to me.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.390
And then...

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.930
Hey, you.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.890
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:03.890
Uh...

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.250
And then I met you.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.170
I could tell right away...
...that you were the same as me...

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.780
That you fed yourself lies...

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.540
Give your hearts!

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.960
Yes, Sir!

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.030
That you were someone desperately trying
to convince yourself...

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.720
But you know, Christa...

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.970
That's why... I won't ask you to understand.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.700
Just that...

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.990
...that you give me one last time...

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.360
...to be honest with myself.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.520
I'm sorry...

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.910
In this environment, I'm 
the strongest one here.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.660
Q-Quit it, Ymir!

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.750
Don't you think a forest like this
is where I can shine the most? Well?

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.840
Ymir! Stop! We'll fall!

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.550
Do you think I care?

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.350
If I became a Titan, I might be
powerless compared to you,

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.520
but I can jump through the 
trees and move swiftly.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.480
I could snatch Eren away from you
and go back to meet up with the Scouts...

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.280
...and probably succeed.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.570
If you don't agree to take
Christa with you right now,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.410
I'll get in your way and 
fight you right here.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.660
Wh-What are you saying?!
Don't you care what happens to her?!

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.080
We can't help her that way!

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.670
Yeah, that's fine.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:53.090
Even if it means taking her future away,
I'll do what it takes to live and meet her.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.590
I might be the shittiest 
person there ever was.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.870
You guys don't know what it's like.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.850
She knows how awful I am,
and yet she still smiles at me... that girl.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.480
You...

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.100
Don't be mad at me.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.190
I have a plan for it.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.470
If I stay and fight, it should be easier
for you to escape anyways!

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.990
Or would you rather stay 
and kill each other?!

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.310
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.420
A light?

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.420
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.840
It's the light that appears
when a Titan transforms!

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.300
Then we're just in time.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.720
Soldiers, disperse!

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.670
We believe the enemy has already transformed!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.940
Locate Eren and recover him!

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.820
Another one of the Police!

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.370
Battle is not our objective!

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.420
Prioritize recovery and retreat!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.250
Phil! Round up the horses!

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.050
Yes, Sir!

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.880
First thing is to find the enemy
and let the others know!

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.130
They should be fleeing from the forest!

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:19.990
Break!

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.140
Eren.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.870
Where are you?!

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.980
Is that the scream of a Titan?

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.980
It came from ahead!

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.860
You can't hide from me!

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.280
Wait!

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.030
This is Ymir!

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.930
She's the one they took! In Titan form!

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.950
Hey, Ymir! Why are you the only one here?!

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.880
Where's Eren?!
What about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.510
So that's Ymir?

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.050
Did she turn into a Titan
and fight with Reiner?!

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.470
Ymir?

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.810
Did you get away from Reiner?!
Where are they?!

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.290
Tell us anything, Ymir!

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.480
Say something already!

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.300
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.360
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.620
Something's not right.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.830
Why... is she looking 
at everybody one by one?

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.140
Ymir!

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.960
Thank goodness!

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:34.710
You're all right!

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:37.950
Huh?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:43.590
No...

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.590
She...

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.800
She ate Christa!

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.900
Don't just stand there! Chase her!

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.570
She's fast! We're losing her!

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.320
Why would Ymir do that?!

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.660
I can't be the only one who could've 
guessed it would turn out this way!

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.030
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.800
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!
She lured us right in!

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.000
Here she comes, Reiner.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.990
Right.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:46.910
Oh no...

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.460
Eren's being taken away!

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.720
Don't stop!

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:53.870
Get on your horse and chase!

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.190
I'm getting him back no matter what!

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.090
Even if it means trading my life for it!

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.690
The battle of pursuit begins.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.340
The hunters and the hunted.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.220
The intense emotions of friends made foe...
spill and clash on the battlefield.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.450
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:04.170
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity,
Erwin executes a do-or-die strategy.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:11.680
"Charge"

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.540
Next episode:

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:09.140
"Charge."
