00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.480
There are likely no Titans
among the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.770
Multiple Titans from the south!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.360
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.080
The 104th Cadet Corps were kept isolated
under suspicion of Titans within their ranks.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.840
But with the sudden appearance of Titans,
couriers were dispatched to warn each district.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.840
As you may know,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.100
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.580
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.560
However...

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.990
What?!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.240
They all started sprinting!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.990
The cause of this crisis remains in the dark.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.870
For now, no one yet knows.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.060
I must say, what a clever idea.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.030
"I'm Home"

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.700
"Trost District"

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700
Commander Pyxis!

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.290
Titans have been spotted!

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.210
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.570
Hmm.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.080
"Stohess District"

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.510
What the hell does all this mean?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.800
Damn it!

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.470
But...

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.450
Would Titans break walls with Titans in them?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.650
It's happened before.
They busted the wall into our city.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.110
That was a gate.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.770
Armin? What are you saying?

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.620
The thing about the walls...

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.080
There's no crevices between the rocks
or any signs of cracking.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.710
We can't really tell how they're made.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.170
So what if they're made 
of hardened Titan skin?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.810
It must be pretty versatile
if Annie can encase herself.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.180
Titans... in the wall...

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.820
Section Commander! What are you doing?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.730
We're supposed to leave in 5 minutes!

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.820
Please hurry up!

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.190
There's something I need to confirm--

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.890
Hey.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.740
Get moving.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.200
Ah, sorry!

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.580
What about him?

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.630
He's been ready for a while now.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.550
Eren. Wear it right.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.640
It's cold at night.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.630
Sorry to keep ya!

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.560
Took longer to prepare than we thought.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.900
Um...

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.150
Isn't this a priest from 
the Order of the Walls?

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.610
Yeah. Nick and I are best buddies.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.880
Right?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.110
Don't let him bother you.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.160
The whole makeup of this squad
doesn't make any sense.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.640
Does it, Levi?

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.750
No, I think it might.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.270
Erwin picked them out for a reason.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.250
Open the gate!

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.600
The situation within Wall Rose is unclear.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.110
But everything up until Ehrmich is safe.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.310
We'll save time going through there.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.730
Move out!

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.150
Yes, sir!

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.770
Take us out.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.570
Yes, sir!

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.770
This whole time, Titans have been
protecting us from Titans.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.270
Huh? He knew?

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.480
There's Titans inside the walls
and he's known about it?!

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.830
Yes, though...

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240
...he's kept his mouth shut this entire time.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.200
But now he's coming with us
to witness the harsh reality.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.390
Will his beliefs be strong enough
for him to stay silent?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.770
Or will seeing it with his own eyes
make him question himself?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.170
No, no, no, no! This is all backwards!

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.970
If there's something you 
know, tell us about it!

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.800
Nothing's more important than
keeping humans from going extinct!

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.430
Eren, settle down.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.290
You're still not fully healed.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.000
There's more than one way to get answers.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.820
I may be injured and useless right now,
but it doesn't take much to watch one man.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.840
I'm hoping we can settle this
without blasting a hole in anyone.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.660
Aren't you?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.910
Threatening him doesn't work, Levi.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.350
Believe me, I've tried.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.300
It seems to me that this priest
is capable of sound judgment.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.910
That's why I wonder...

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.840
What if the reason he doesn't talk

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.910
is because he knows something more
important than the fate of humanity?

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.470
See that? It's the village!

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.810
Is that the last one?

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.600
No! My village is deep in the forest!

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.980
I'll go there alone!

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.360
All right!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.280
Leave this village to me!

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.260
Got it!

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.830
Hey! Quit it, Sasha!

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.250
Sasha! You been nabbing snacks again?!

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.290
Stop! Spit it out!

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:07.750
Get it out of yer mouth!

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.470
We fixin' to smoke that for winter, ya moron!

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.690
You damn dumb girl!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.980
Fine!

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.260
Have it yer way.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.730
Dagnabbit.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:41.350
Sasha.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.600
Have you asked yerself
why the world is a-changing?

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.590
Why these past few years the forest
be shrinkin' and game harder to find?

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.720
Have you ever thunk about it?

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.350
It's 'cause more people be comin' and
taking food and game from the forest.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.270
That's why I'm hungry.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.930
That's true.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.990
But, hey...

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.700
They lost their homes and got no place to go.
They got no other choice.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.200
Their fault for losing it.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.780
They oughta leave ours.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.530
Titans took it from 'em.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.250
They knocked a hole straight through Wall Maria.
Where else can they go?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:33.280
You can feed a hell of a lot more people
by clearin' the forest and plantin' grain.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.760
Maybe it's time for our family to let go
of the forest and give up huntin' for good.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.850
The government said they would pay us.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.060
Every horse that we raise 
is money in our pockets.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.810
You gotta be kidding!

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.780
If we give up huntin',
we be givin' up who we are!

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.910
Why should we give a hoot about
the people who make fun of our lifestyle?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.450
I'll tell ya why.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.670
It's because... we're all
part of the same world.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.830
We humans... We've always been pack animals.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.050
Sure, we all live our different ways.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:18.510
But when space is this short, we gotta
join the group and do what's best to--

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.640
No! I refuse!

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.850
We've lived here all our lives,
just like the way our ancestors taught us!

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.690
We don't owe nothing to any outsiders!

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.190
I see...

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.740
So be it.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.900
Ya can live here in this forest,
along with the others who think the same.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.730
But, Sasha...

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.140
Are ya willin' to die for that choice?

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:56.030
No matter what trouble comes yer way,
ya can't go beggin' for help.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:02.170
If you're not there for them,
don't expect them to be there for you.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.140
I'm willin' to give up our traditions
if it means I can live with my family.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.010
Goes to show ya our world's connected,
whether you like it or not.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.110
Sasha. Are you that much of a scaredy-cat?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.530
Is it that hard for you to leave this forest
behind and get along with others?

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.130
It's been 3 years since I've been back.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.560
Surely he realized something
was amiss and fled...

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.920
It can't be! Way out here?

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.650
They've already come this far?!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.030
This place isn't safe for people anymore.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.030
What's that? A new village?

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:14.060
"In addition to the cities at the walls,
 there exist villages of various sizes contained within the walls."
 "They exist to provide goods and food to the people in the cities,
 though containing a higher population overall."

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:14.060
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Scattered Villages"

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.570
Damn! If I don't slice it off,
it'll just heal back up!

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:37.860
A child?

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.550
I'm so sorry...

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.280
What's your name?

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.990
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.910
What will?

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.160
Huh? What? I mean... Um...

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.420
Steady... Steady...

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.170
Um, you see...

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:20.920
Huh?

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.550
You're kidding me! Hey!

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.520
Please wait for us!

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.800
There's no need to worry.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.810
Please stay calm. It'll come right back.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.770
Why are you so nice when you talk?

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.820
What?

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:46.360
Run away from here!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.060
It'll be okay!

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.950
Why? Everyone already left.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.710
The whole village knew
my mother's legs were bad.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.630
But not a single person came to help.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.750
All I could do was watch.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.400
It'll be okay!

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.900
It's okay.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.630
You're really starting to tick me off.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:37.450
What?

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.040
That stupid way you talk 
politely to everyone.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.230
Why don't you talk to 
other cadets like normal?

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.210
Um... Well, you see...

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.220
Wait. Let me guess.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:56.060
You're embarrassed by the way
people sound from your village.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.100
Bull's-eye?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.810
I'm surprised an idiot 
like you cares so much.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.360
You can't do anything but hunt,
and you're afraid of people, to top it off.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.360
I bet you don't have a single good reason
for aiming to become a soldier.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.110
Your parents probably--

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.360
Stop it, Ymir! You're being--

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.530
Sasha!

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.580
You gonna care what other people think
and be someone you're not your whole life?

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.750
What a crock of shit.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.870
You're fine as is, so talk in
your own words for crying out loud.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.510
Th-Thank you...

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.970
...very much.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.340
What?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.840
I'm... sorry.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.390
I'm not... yet...

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.810
Cut it out!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.060
There's nothing wrong with the way she talks!

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.060
Sasha is who Sasha wants to be.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.400
Her words will always be her own.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.580
And I happen to like her.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.900
Hmph! Have it your way.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.190
Still, even if she changed the way she talks,

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.450
it won't change the fact that she's annoying.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.370
You know, not everyone 
is as insensitive as you.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.960
Excuse me?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.710
You little... You little...

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.960
Hey! What are you laughing at?!

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.510
Ah! I'm sorry!

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.060
Why do I remember, now of all times...

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.730
...about silly, pointless days in the past?

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.730
It's all... I can think of.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.500
Hey, listen up.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.900
You'll be fine. Keep following this path.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.990
Run as far as you can.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.750
I promise someone will be there to help you.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.460
You might not find them right away...

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.000
But still, keep running until you do!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.130
Now, go!

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.510
Run!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.720
Get runnin'!

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.780
If I take out both eyes,
it'll buy us plenty of time.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.790
Only... two left.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.460
Relax...

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.420
All it is... is a big...

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.550
...slow moving...

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.920
...target!

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.090
Got it!

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.680
One more arrow.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.550
But, if I miss this...

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.070
...we can't escape.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.780
If I miss, me and...

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:58.650
...that girl...

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.650
I slipped out thanks to that blood.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.850
Now I've gotta find that girl!

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.450
Huh? Sasha?

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.130
We been givin' horses 
to everyone in the area.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.100
That girl told us someone 
was still back there.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.850
Who'da thunk it was you?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.890
You fought off a Titan 
for that girl, didn't ya?

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.110
Sasha... Yer all I hoped for.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.040
Father...

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.200
I'm home.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.460
Conny, wait!

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.580
Calm down!

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.560
There could be Titans anywhere!

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.770
Get back here, Conny!

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.170
This can't be...

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.680
Anyone?! Is anyone there?!

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.560
It's me! Conny!

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.740
I came back!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.780
My house!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.990
Dad...

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.210
Mom...

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.750
Sunny... Martin!

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.200
Please be okay!

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:37.370
Conny! Get back!

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.420
It's... my house.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.250
My...

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.990
Conny...

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.780
Fall back, you two!

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.030
I'll scout the area!

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:52.830
Wait, it's...

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.750
It can't move?

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.290
Not with those legs...

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.430
Th-Then... How?

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.100
How did it even get here?!

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.630
"I'm sure my family is safe and sound."

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.280
Shaking off the dread of Titans
appearing in his hometown,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.990
Conny once again departs.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:56.640
Battle erupts across the land
while the mystery of the Titans remains.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.000
As the plight worsens,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.170
Eren and the others heading 
for Ehrmich District

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.090
receive a clue that might reveal the truth.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:11.640
"Southwestward"

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.370
Next episode: "Southwestward."
