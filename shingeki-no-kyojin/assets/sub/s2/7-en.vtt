WEBVTT

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.410
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.710
That's all I care about now.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.330
I chose to be a soldier in the hopes
of joining the Military Police

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.580
so I could work in the safety of the interior.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.340
Why do <i>you</i> want to be a soldier?

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.470
I...

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.550
I decided I have to kill them.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.070
I decided I have to slaughter all the Titans...

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.030
...with my own two hands.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.290
So your encounter with the Titans
<i>didn't</i> break your will?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.990
You'll be able to do it.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300
Eren Jaeger, was it?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.230
You damn traitors!

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.960
"Close Combat"

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.990
Eren!

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.100
If only...

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.680
If only I'd cut off their heads!

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.020
That was the perfect chance!

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.900
I should've been able to do it, so why?!

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.740
That was it. There won't be another chance!

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.000
Everyone, jump away from the wall!

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.970
It got Ymir!

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.310
And somebody else, too!

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.150
He ate 'em!

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.820
Th-This can't be...

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.660
Bertholdt...

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.000
All soldiers, prepare to attack!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.880
We're taking down the Colossal Titan!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.520
It's a threat to all of humanity!

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.430
Swarm the huge bastard!

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.780
Just like the reports said, he's slow!

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.500
It might be big, but that's it!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.790
Compared to the Titans we
normally fight, this'll be easy!

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.670
We've got this!

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.470
Now's our chance! Slice up his neck!

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.180
Too hot!

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.100
Everyone, fall back!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
My hand!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.470
Water! Bring water!

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.450
He's trying to disappear again?

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.990
No, something is different.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.240
The last time he vanished instantly,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.450
but now, he's maintaining his form
and emitting heat like a furnace.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.840
If he keeps protecting himself with steam...

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.920
We're unable to attack him with ODM gear!

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.100
Wh-What do we do?!

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.550
We can't do anything. We wait.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.930
Squads three and four,
take position behind the target.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.310
Rashad has command.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.890
Got it!

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.480
Squad two will wait here.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.440
Lauda is in command.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.330
Understood!

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.990
It's yet to be seen how long
he can keep his body burning, but...

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.490
...eventually he has to come out.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.190
We wait for that moment to attack.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.510
Listen up.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.240
Forget about capturing them.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.520
Kill 'em...

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:36.750
...and don't hesitate!

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.250
Armin... and squad one follow me!

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.300
We've got a date with the Armored Titan!

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.630
Hot!

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.310
Christa! Conny! Get further back!

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.260
And take care of those two injured soldiers.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.560
U-Um!

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.290
Huh?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.810
Ymir can't possibly be dead yet.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.020
Please... Rescue her!

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.790
Right.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.740
Where are Reiner and Bertholdt?!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.870
They don't have their ODM gear either!

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.370
Please, go find and help those two!

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.120
You shit...

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.550
You big piece of shit.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.530
And here you wouldn't shut up
about a soldier's duty...

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
During close combat training,
were you always holding back on me?

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.240
You're so strong, it's ridiculous.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.420
I can't even move an inch of my body.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.800
I always thought you were a stand-up guy.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.310
Someone who remained calm,
regardless of the situation...

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.810
A guy who put your comrades ahead of yourself...

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.060
And I...

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.940
To think at one time I wished...
to be as strong as you someday.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.950
That did nothing!

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.260
Eren's attack didn't...

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.290
And my blades don't work either?!

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.090
What's worse, unlike Annie,
his whole body is hard!

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.060
Eren!

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.350
Hey, Reiner...

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.550
I don't know what kind of face
you're making right now, but...

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.940
You guys... You really are
the worst pieces of shit.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:27.500
I bet in the history of mankind,
nobody's done anything as terrible as you.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.800
I've gotta erase you.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.720
You shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.140
What the hell are you thinking?

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.190
I've never felt so revolted before.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.520
Just remembering you and
your self-righteous face is making me sick.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:10:00.530
It makes me want to vomit.
You... big damn pest!

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.340
It's time to exterminate you!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.010
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Titan Martial Arts"

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.010
"Though not typically an impressive exhibition of power and size,
 martial arts is similarly effective for Titans as it is for humans.
 Grappling holds and throws used against a Titan
 opponent are sometimes more potent than a striking blow."

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.140
Damn, that hurt, Annie!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.400
Haven't you ever heard the concept
of pulling your punches?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.280
I did it because you're coming at me full-force.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.030
I've gotta respond with
equal strength of my own.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.030
And if you're a guy...

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.700
...aren't you... supposed to be gentle
with this delicate body of mine?

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.500
Huh? Your jokes aren't funny at all.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.390
If strength is the deciding factor, then why
am I on my ass and you're still standing?

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.070
Well...

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.310
I didn't throw you using my strength.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.920
It's a technique used to protect yourself
against an opponent stronger than you.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.400
If I were you, I'd think about learning it.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.780
All right, already! Why don't we take a break?

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:29.750
Annie!

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.580
Surrender!

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.880
I surrender!

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.500
Surrender? Try to learn something first
before you surrender.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.510
Learn how to use your strength and
the proper way to speak to women!

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.510
All right! I promise I'll learn,
so let go already!

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.680
Yeah? Do you want to learn that badly?

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.320
Why the hell did Reiner come flying this way?

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.670
Hey, Annie.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.770
I wanna learn that move, too.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.410
Show me.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.160
I don't know...

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:18.170
That move is meant to be used against humans,
so I don't think you have any use for it.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.690
But... I'm interested to see if it works...

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.930
...on a beast like you.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.270
Are you serious? It's happening...

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.060
Hey, hey!

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.100
Are they going at it?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.440
It's the big showdown!

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.020
--Who'll win?!

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.310
--Annie, you think?
--Who'll win?!

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.940
Huh? Are you stupid?!

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.770
I bet my whole dinner on Mikasa!

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.760
What do you think, Eren?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.700
I...

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.380
Which one, I wonder?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.710
Huh?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.170
How did that turn out in the end?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.720
No... Why am I remembering it now?

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.050
Is this what they call having
your life flash before your eyes?

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.980
Actually, who gives a shit anymore?

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.990
I don't think I've felt...
this awful in my whole life.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.110
Eren!

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.240
Don't do it! You can't win in a slugfest!

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.070
Run this way!

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.590
Eren! Don't try to fight him!

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.250
Eren!

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.590
This is bad!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.300
Did he lose control?!

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.360
He threw the Armored Titan!

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.030
Wait... Isn't that...

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.520
...the technique Annie used?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:18.080
I don't know what the hell you guys are trying
to accomplish by doing all this, but...

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.910
Now that I think of it, your plan
has been full of flaws from the start!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.300
Your biggest mistake was this!

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.800
You should've thought twice
about teaching me how to fight!

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.560
It's working! I've got him now!

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.260
I still have a chance!

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.070
Think again!

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.290
Eren!

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.870
You're not getting away from this!

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.630
He did it!

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.520
Eren! Can you hear me?!

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.020
Run away! Get closer to the wall!

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.770
Their goal is to kidnap and take you away!

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.070
We've gotta escape and
prevent that from happening!

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.360
But, Armin, Reiner isn't going to
let us do as we please!

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.500
It's dangerous here! Get back, you two!

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:10.690
Huh?

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.160
Nice, Eren! Good call!

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.000
He's back in control again.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.930
Yeah, but like you were saying,

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.770
it'll be almost impossible to escape Reiner.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.490
What the hell?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.100
I knew it... The Colossal Titan.
Why did that bastard show up here?!

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.070
Where's Eren?

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.630
What's the situation?

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.400
Eren and the others are that way!

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.620
Eren?!

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.620
Is that Eren's Titan form?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.330
Listen up, Eren.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.690
If you're gonna escape, we've got to find a way to halt Reiner

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.630
and buy you some time!

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.780
Can you break his leg with
another one of those joint locks?

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.430
Our blades don't seem to work on him,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.970
so use your head and figure out
the best course of action!

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.740
Mikasa!

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.220
Use these. It's the rest of my blades.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.220
I'm counting on you!

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.210
This time, running away is a guaranteed victory.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.670
It's you guys that are screwed
for revealing what you are.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.760
You're the ones backed into a corner.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.890
He's fast!

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.860
Shit!

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.640
Leg! His leg!

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.910
Don't stay on the ground! Eren!

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.740
Stand up!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.290
Dammit! His tackle is too much to handle!

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.630
Shit... Since when could he move so quick?

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.380
Are we completely useless here?!

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:38.760
No...

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.350
If his entire body was hard like stone,
there's no way he could move like that.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.810
In the armor they used in wars of the past,

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.560
it had sections at the joints not covered
in metal to allow for movement.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.030
Like at the armpits and groin...

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.940
And also... the spot behind the knee.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.780
I can't evade it...

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.950
Since I'll get knocked over anyways...

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.660
Bring it!

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.080
Gimme that neck!

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.130
You're mine!

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.930
Yeah! That's it, Eren!

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.890
I've got 'em! Now it's a battle of strength!

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.270
This freak...

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.850
Not enough!

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.740
Mikasa!

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:43.740
She cut him!

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.290
He can't fight back as much anymore!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.470
You've got this!

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.470
Go for it, Eren!

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.430
Tear the head off his neck!

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.230
Pull the traitor outta there!

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.150
I can win!

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.320
Against Reiner... I can win!

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.710
Wh-What the--?

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.460
Heh, it's useless.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.540
Keep at it! Don't let up!

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.740
He stopped...

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.180
But why there?

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.200
Be on your guard!

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.410
He's calling in Titans!

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.550
No other Titans spotted in the area!

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.800
What a useless struggle.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.180
Try screaming for help with
your head ripped off, you idiot!

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.760
Look, he's tearing it off!

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.310
What's with the Armored Titan?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.460
Why'd he scream like that?

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.580
Hey...

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.320
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.130
Above you! Look out!

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.420
The battle between Eren and the Armored Titan
comes to an abrupt conclusion.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.740
With its fall from the wall,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.070
Mikasa is injured by the Colossal Titan
and Hannes comes running to her side.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:59.460
To protect Eren through his reckless behavior...
to stand proudly at his side...

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.570
...that is, and has always been,
the wish of Mikasa and Armin.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.600
"The Hunters"

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.080
