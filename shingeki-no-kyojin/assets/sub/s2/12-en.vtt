00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.600
Eren.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.060
You're a man!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.650
Stop!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.980
"Scream"

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.530
Damn that Reiner!

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.030
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.630
This is all your fault!

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.680
It's you who screwed up my entire plan,
you damn commander!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.020
Ymir!

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.560
Conny, that way!

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.700
I know!

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.010
Commander!

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.350
I can always be replaced.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.780
More importantly, find Eren and retreat!

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.330
Time is of the essence!

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.050
Eren!

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.480
Hannes!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.190
What are the odds of this?!

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.900
Check it out, you two!

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.940
You just watch.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.780
I'm about to avenge your mother
and butcher the shit out of this!

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.750
Hannes!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.500
Give the old man backup!

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.040
Huh?!

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.130
Reiner? What's he doing?!

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.550
Does he not care if Eren is eaten?!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.520
Don't get in our way, you big sack of shit!

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.570
Ymir!

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.010
Dammit... What am I supposed to do?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.330
If I can't count on Reiner, should I cooperate
with the Scouts and try to survive?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.620
But what happens after that?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.960
Even if I can somehow 
live through all this...

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.060
...there's no avoiding the hell
that's to come trapped inside the walls.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.530
Now's my only chance
to hand Historia over to their side!

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.790
I won't be able to protect her alone,
no matter how hard I try.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.940
Christa!

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.150
Conny, that's wrong.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.920
My name is Historia.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.360
Hey, Ymir...

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.200
Why was it you were trying to take me away?

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.740
You said it was to save yourself,
but was that a lie?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.280
No... it has to be.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.170
Why? Why did you do it?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.550
For me?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.010
To protect me again?

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.260
It's a Titan!

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.060
Ymir...

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.650
You're the one who said it,
so listen to yourself!

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.740
Stop living for other people!

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.520
From now on, let's live 
for nobody but ourselves!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.950
It's strange, really...

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.910
When I'm with you,
no matter how screwed up it gets...

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.360
...I'm not afraid!

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.050
Shit!

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.110
Don't, Mikasa! You're injured!

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.070
Untie my hands!

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.740
Hands?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.110
Hurry up!

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.320
I've gotta be the one to do it!

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.660
Who said I was done with you?!

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.790
That one's... mine!

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.660
Eren!

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.290
Wait! We're trying to get you out of here!

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.130
It's time to settle the score!

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.760
Just watch!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.430
Huh?!

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.570
Commander!

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.900
The Armored one is--

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.040
It's coming!

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.010
Jean!

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.270
Jean!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.940
Are you okay?!

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.440
Hold it together!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.030
Shit!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.180
Shit!

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.350
What's wrong?!

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.770
Eren!

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.450
Commander!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.560
Right now...

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.770
...I've gotta become a Titan...

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.280
...or it's all for nothing!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.820
Eren...

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.530
Nothing changed!

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.880
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.850
You're still as useless as you ever were!

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.630
Nothing changed!

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.920
Mom...

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.610
I... can't...

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.190
I still... can't do anything at all.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.650
Eren...

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.600
That's not true.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.640
Eren...

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.150
Listen...

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.660
...I need to tell you something.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.030
You've always... been at my side.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:38.900
Thank you.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.290
You showed me... how to live with purpose.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.220
Thank you.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.050
And you...

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.690
You wrapped this scarf around me.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.260
Thank you.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.000
I'll wrap that around you...

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.400
as many times as you want.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:37.880
Now and forever... As much as you want!

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.820
Why... are they...?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.860
They're eating it?

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.460
Dunno what's going on, but now's our chance!

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.870
Let's hurry and run!

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.700
Right!

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.660
So that's how it is...

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.550
That's why Reiner was so desperate for Eren.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.920
Which means, even inside the walls...

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.510
...there's a future.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.380
This is the worst...

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.440
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.180
the hands of the worst person imaginable?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.230
We've gotta get it back...

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.990
I can say... without a doubt...

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.240
...the one person in the world
I wouldn't want to have it...

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.240
...Eren... is you!

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.910
Get away from me!

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.210
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.340
Not good! Bertholdt!

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.430
I can't protect Bertholdt like this!

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.600
What? The Titans?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.380
Eren!

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.890
Get on!

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:57.770
Armin!

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.690
Hurry!

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.350
Don't let this chance escape!

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.440
Full retreat!

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.320
Ymir!

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.080
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?!
We're heading back!

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.990
I sorry...

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.570
Huh?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.270
Ymir! Where are you going?!

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:41.900
Leave her!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.110
But Ymir is--

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:10.020
In that moment, I couldn't understand
the motivation behind Ymir's actions...

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.830
...but the Armored Titan
didn't pursue us any further.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:41.000
<font size="18">"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Unyielding Vow"
"Through extensive research and accounts of various incidents,
 it has become clear that the scourge of Titans which have
 long plagued humanity are of human origin. The Colossal Titan
 which destroyed the wall at Shiganshina District is a human
 possessing the ability to transform into a Titan,
 demonstrated by its intent to breach the wall with the
 purpose to exterminate humans. Titans are not sent by the heavens
 to punish us for our sins, but invaders that must be driven back.
Thus, we swear, by the blood our brothers and comrades
 have spilled waging war against this foe,
 we shall not relent our lands nor yield the fight."</c>

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:57.180
Ymir...

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.050
Why did you come to us?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.650
Oh, well...

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.630
It's because I'm an idiot.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.190
I'll be your souvenir to take back home.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.360
You can't just go back empty-handed.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.310
Ymir...

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.120
If you hadn't come to bust up this wall...

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.730
...I would've never woken up
from that nightmare.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.780
All I'm doing...

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.510
...is returning what I borrowed back then.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:36.270
Because I'm probably the only one
that understands the situation you're in.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.100
Thank you, Ymir.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.810
I'm sorry...

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.370
No...

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.010
It wasn't so bad, you know...
being a goddess for a while.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.330
With reports declaring the possibility
that Wall Rose has been breached,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.360
the citizens of Wall Rose were forced to take

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.340
refuge in an underground 
city within Wall Sina.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.520
However, with more than half the

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.490
population surviving off food 
stockpiled for emergency,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.740
rations would last at most for a week.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.080
Any longer than that, and people 
would turn on each other,

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.740
stealing and killing to survive.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:32.900
To stop this from happening,
within one week from the initial outset,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.520
authorities declared that 
Wall Rose was secure.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.240
"Trost District"

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.170
It's Hange.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:50.980
Come in.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.480
Pardon the interruption, Erwin.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.710
I'm glad we came while you're here,
Commander Pyxis.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.770
Good timing. This is...

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.600
A Scout from the 104th. Conny Springer.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.980
Conny comes from Ragako Village.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.690
The village the recent
Titan invasion originated from?

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.330
Yes.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.520
Actually, I confirmed with him the findings
of our investigation on the village.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.370
This only brings further credibility
to that hypothesis.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.370
He's come to report.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.950
I was taken away...

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:38.130
And because of that, the Scouts lost
more than half their veteran soldiers.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.570
Just to rescue me...

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.180
Still, there were no 
casualties on our way back.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.940
The Titans completely ignored us
and ran off to chase Reiner and the others.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.490
About that, Jean and I sat down
to try and figure it out.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.780
We have an idea what made
the Titans act that way.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.290
It was you.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.830
Of course, that's just our theory.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.550
But without assuming that,
there's just no explaining what happened.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.420
It's a tough spot to be in, Eren.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.550
Whether or not all those
people died for nothing...

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.470
...it all depends on you.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.520
If you're worth the price they paid,
you better show it.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.040
We don't have time to waste.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.450
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.160
I've gotta do this.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.870
I'll control the Titans.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.120
I'll plug up Wall Maria.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.670
I'll capture Reiner and make him pay.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.540
That's what I've gotta do
to atone for all those lives lost.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:02.630
Say again?

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.020
The Titans responsible for this incident...
were the citizens of Ragako?

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.330
In other words, the true 
identity of Titans...

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.880
...is humans?

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.190
We don't... have proof yet.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.200
So... you're telling me...

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.230
...I've spent all this time and energy

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.050
running around killing people?

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.560
Is that right?

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.960
I said we don't have proof yet.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.280
Erwin.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.570
Hey. Tell me.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.520
The hell you smiling for?

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.690
It's nothing.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.810
It's just...

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.520
...with this, we've taken
one more step towards the truth.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.210
Just one step, huh?

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.010
We'll run out of people
before we learn the truth.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.150
It's not worth the cost.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.350
But it is a step towards the truth.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.400
One day, we'll break it down.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.520
This wall hiding the truth...

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.580
...will fall.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.600
Not yet, eh?
