WEBVTT

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.690
Here she comes, Reiner.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:05.930
Right.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.500
Oh no...

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.460
Eren's being taken away!

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.180
All squads! Let the Titans chase after you!

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.100
Follow my lead!

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Erwin...

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.150
You demon! Are you trying
to use us as bait again?!

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.230
That's not my intention!

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.190
The Military Police have fought well!

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.490
Now serve your duty as soldiers!

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.370
The Armored Titan plans to escape with Eren!

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.900

We have to stop him no matter what!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.010
"Charge"

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.520
He's not fast enough to 
escape! We'll catch up!

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.150
This time, I won't hesitate.
I'll kill them both, I swear!

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.430
And if Ymir gets in my way,
she's asking for it, too.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.700
No matter what it takes... I will!

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.760
Christa!

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.920
Ymir...

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.730
Ymir!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.990
Chris--

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.760
No... Historia.
Sorry... for eating you... like that.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.000
I bet... you're mad at me.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.330
Ymir...

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.000
What is this? What are you doing?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.300
We came here to rescue you and Er--

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.470
I don't need rescuing!

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.140
Just stay right there.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.470
I'm following Reiner and Bertholdt now.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.850
You, too. Come with me.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.860
There's no future within the walls!

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.860
Listen to me, Historia...

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.950
Outside the walls isn't as bad as you think.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.810
Especially... because there 
won't be anyone saying that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.870
you're better off not being born.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.790
I'm pretty sure Titans won't be
saying that to me...

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.750
...because they'll be too 
busy trying to eat me!

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.960
Everyone has at least one or two faults!

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.120
If you can just overlook that,
they're not so bad after all!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.760
Ymir! Everything you're saying
and doing isn't making any sense!

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.640
Could it be... that Reiner and
Bertholdt threatened you?

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.460
It's... the reverse.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.410
Am I right, Ymir?!

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.290
I'll fight them with you,
so let me out of your hand!

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.500
I don't care if there's something
you can't tell me.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.080
No matter what happens...

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.030
...I will always be your ally!

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.140
Ymir!

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.260
Look...

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810
The Scouts have already gotten this close.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.190
If only we had run right away,
we probably would've been able to escape.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.280
But because you forced us to bring Christa...
at this rate, they'll catch us!

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.320
Hey, Ymir... are you telling us
we did all of that for nothing?

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.030
Did you change your mind?

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.960
Is that really what you want?
Letting Christa rot within the walls?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.210
Don't be stupid! Ymir!

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.380
Ymir! Hurry up and let me go!

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.050
I can't!

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.220
Historia...

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.270
To be honest...

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.810
...the reason I snatched you away...

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.320
...was only... to save myself.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.170
Huh?

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.200
A long time ago, I stole the Power of the Titans
from one of their comrades.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.540
There's nothing I can do against them.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.080
Sooner or later, they'll kill me.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.830
But... if I hand you over
and cooperate with them...

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.700
...they said they would 
see what they could do...

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.090
and try to make it so my crime goes away.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.280
Because you know the secrets of the wall,
you're someone important to the Church.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.240
Does it...

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.770
...have to do with my family?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.420
Yeah, it does.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.060
Once this world started going to hell...

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.940
...I thought being with you would
give me insurance in the future.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.700
I almost died during the 
battle at that castle...

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.910
...and that feeling scarred me for life.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.830
I'm afraid to die...

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.210
I'll do whatever it takes to live...

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.040
I'm pathetic...

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.050
I told myself I was doing it for your sake...

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.560
But really, I did it for myself.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.610
Please, Historia...

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.720
Please...

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.770
Please save me!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.450
I told you already, Ymir.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.330
No matter what happens...
I will always be your ally!

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.080
Reiner! Protect us!

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.260
I knew it! I'll have to kill Ymir first!

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.970
Wait, Mikasa!

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.520
Don't kill Ymir!

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.480
That all depends on Ymir!

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.980
What will it be? I'll kill everyone
that gets in my way, so choose!

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.860
No, wait!

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.740
Ymir will be killed unless she does
what Reiner and Bertholdt say!

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.700
She doesn't have a choice!

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.200
There's only so many lives
that I actually care about.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.580
My enemies made
deciding that easy six years ago.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.710
So... you're mistaken to seek
any compassion from me.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.340
Because right now, I'm all out of time
and room in my heart to care.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.100
Christa... do you pick 
Eren or Ymir? Which is it?

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.770
Will you get in my way, too?!

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.540
Stop, Ymir!

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:50.150
Don't fight back! You'll die!

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.070
Don't move!

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.120
Quit it, Eren!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.780
Don't struggle!

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.560
Good luck with that, Bertholdt.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.780
It's impossible to get him to calm down.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.800
He's the most irritating guy there is!

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.590
I know better than anyone!

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.880
I hate him as much as you do.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.230
So let's beat him up together.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.970
Why don't you come out of there?

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.140
Bertholdt! Give him back!

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.200
Hey... You're kidding, right?
Bertholdt? Reiner?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.770
This whole time...
you kept quiet and deceived us?

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.730
That's so cruel!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.610
You guys! Tell us it's all a lie!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.940
Hey, hey, hey...
You think you can just keep running away?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.710
That's not gonna happen!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.640
For three years, didn't we 
sleep under the same roof

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.910
as comrades through thick and thin?

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.760
Bertholdt... Your odd sleeping positions
were truly an art form.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.850
After a while, we all looked forward
each morning to seeing your pose...

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.520
...and tried using it to predict the weather.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.270
But you...

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:15.020
To think you, the invader...
could sleep like a log...

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.050
...right next your victims!

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.530
Was everything just a lie?

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.410
Remember we talked
about surviving this together?

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.450
And that we'd grow old, and someday
we'd all go out for drinks together?

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.630
Was everything... all a lie?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.040
Was it?!

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.040
You guys...

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.010
What were you guys thinking this whole time?

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.420
What's it even matter anymore?

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.800
Just focus on cutting open his neck.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.310
If you hesitate for a moment,
we won't be able to get Eren back.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.560
They are enemies of humanity.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.250
That's all there is to know.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.070
T-Tell me who!

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.990
Who the hell would want to kill people
by their own choice?!

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.980
Who the hell would like
doing this sort of thing?!

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.410
Do you think I wanted to do this?!

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.210
People hate and despise us...

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.290
We've done such terrible things,
we deserve to die.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.300
Things we'll never be able to take back...

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.300
But... we just... couldn't 
come to terms with our sins.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.000
The only time we had some respite...
was when we pretended to be soldiers.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.020
That's not a lie!

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:40.030
Conny! Jean! It's true we may have
deceived everyone, but it's not all a lie!

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.530
We really considered you comrades!

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.990
Neither of us have any 
right to even apologize.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.790
But... someone...

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.000
Please...

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.300
Someone, please...

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.340
Someone find us!

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.340
Bertholdt...

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.220
Give Eren back.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.470
It's no use... I can't.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.980
Someone has to be the one to do it.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.230
Someone has to be the one
to stain their hands with blood.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.570
You guys!

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.240
Get away from there!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.320
I can't believe him...

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.330
What the hell is that Erwin thinking?

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.290
He's leading a horde of Titans this way!

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.010
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Special Titan Powers"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.010
"Among the Titans, there are those with special powers. 
The intense, high temperature steam of the Colossal Titan and
 the hardened skin of the Armored Titan are prime examples.
 It remains unknown how they possess such abilities."

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.020
You guys! Jump and get outta there!

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.230
All soldiers, disperse!

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.520
Get far away from the Titans!

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.230
Historia!

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.980
What's going on?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.660
Is this hell?

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.610
No... but it will be!

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.610
All soldiers, charge!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.610
The fate of humanity will be determined
in this very moment!

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:56.660
There is no future where humanity
can inhabit these lands without Eren!

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.540
We recover Eren and immediately retreat!

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.210
Give your hearts!

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.670
Mikasa!

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.720
Those crazy Scouts.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.060
Something's wrong with their heads.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.890
Hey!

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:20.730
Huh?

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.780
What's happening out there?

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.360
What the hell's going on?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.240
I can't move...

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.370
Unless I tear these Titans off me,
it'll only get worse.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.750
In that case...

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.370
Brace yourself, Bertholdt!

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.680
A little more...

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.090
Just a little more!

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:52.380
It worked!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.140
His hand's gone!

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.720
Now's our chance!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.890
Hey, Mikasa?! Can't you 
see all those Titans?!

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.390
How do you plan on getting through that mess?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.310
You'd have to slip through a horde of 'em.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.250
Advance!

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.580
Commander Erwin!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.690
Advance!

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.120
Eren is just ahead!

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.750
Advance!

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.250
Right!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.420
Mikasa!

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.880
You piece of shit!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.380
Let her go!

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.560
We've come this far already.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.810
We're taking Eren home with us.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.560
We're going back to our hometown.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.230
Shit... This is all because I got caught.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.690
Everyone's gonna die because of me.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.290
Bertholdt!

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.700
Armin?!

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.370
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.120
...can't change anything.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.670
Advance!

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.590
What is it?

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.780
What do I have to abandon?

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.220
Is it my life?

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.490
Or something else?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.020
Are you two okay with this?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.320
Leaving behind your comrade
and returning home?

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.280
You're abandoning Annie?

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.590
You know where she's at?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.340
Far north, deep underground in
the Utopia District... and being tortured.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.060
It was her screams that taught us something.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.600
That even with her body's healing,
you can never get rid of the pain.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.480
They're taking special care
to ensure she doesn't die.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.360
And as we speak,
they're not giving her body any rest.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.660
They're torturing her 
every way they know how.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.740
You spawn of the devil!

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.750
I'll pulverize you!

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.480
All soldiers, retreat!

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.530
I did it.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.250
My first kill.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.160
Ymir...

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.460
Christa!

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.460
What the hell are you doing?! We're leaving!

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.960
Let's hurry home and chow down!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.380
Conny! Sasha! Leave me be!

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.430
Lemme go!

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.390
Huh?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.390
Ymir said if I don't go with her,
Reiner and Bertholdt are going to kill her!

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.020
If she hands me in, they'll let her go free!

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.020
We were gonna go with them!

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.400
What the heck? Ymir said that?

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.820
Yes, so let me down!

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.260
It's a lie! Of course that's a lie!
She's lying to you!

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.910
Sasha is right.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.770
You think the one who fought like

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.330
a maniac to save you would 
do something like that?

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.860
The only time Ymir ever shows some effort
is when you're in trouble.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.390
I don't know about her getting killed, but...

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.840
For now, just calm down.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.140
That's right!

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.270
If you two stay here any longer,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.650
there's a huge chance that you'll 
die and it'll only get worse!

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.270
You know, even an idiot 
could figure that out.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.790
Damn that Reiner!

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.290
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.400
Eren! Mikasa!

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.560
Eren...

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.770
Eren encounters the very Titan
that devoured his mother.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.200
Unable to move his body,
Hannes steps in to protect him.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:53.570
What is the enemy? What is the war?

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.660
Not knowing what to brandish
their swords against, the Scouts battle on.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:04.610
Where will they ever find
the future that they pursue?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.560
"Scream"

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.200
Next episode: "Scream."
