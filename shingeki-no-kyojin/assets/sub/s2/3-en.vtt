WEBVTT

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.940
Conny!

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.150
Are there any survivors?

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.180
No...

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.120
None at all.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.650
It's all over...

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.660
My hometown... It's gone forever.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.310
Hey! Something's strange here.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.470
Has anyone spotted any bodies?

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.620
No...

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.180
I haven't.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560
How is that even possible?

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.600
Titans come and not a single drop of blood?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.310
Everyone must've escaped!

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.400
It means nobody here was eaten.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.940
Including your family, too.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.400
I see... That's gotta be it!

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.280
Yeah. It's unbelievable to think Titans
ate everyone without leaving blood behind.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.360
That's not all that's unbelievable.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.060
If the entire village was really evacuated,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.030
why would Titans obliterate
these houses with nobody in them?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.050
But what really boggles 
my mind is the stables.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.120
If they tried to escape without horses,
their chances of survival would be slim.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.030
Everyone got their torches?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.330
Let's move!

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.070
Our mission now is to locate
and assess the breach in the wall!

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.230
Yes, sir!

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.350
Wel... come... home...

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.120
Just now...

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.480
Conny, hurry up!

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.560
We're falling behind Gerger!

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.560
Reiner? Did you hear that?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.820
The Titan--

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.770
I didn't hear anything at all.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.530
Enough with the chit-chat.
Focus on the mission!

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.530
But it... I think...

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.530
I don't know how, but...

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.210
I think...

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.620
My mom...

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.070
Conny! Do you understand
the situation we're in?!

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.280
Hundreds of thousands of lives depend
on whether we complete this mission or not!

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.390
Your family might have escaped,
but it's not over yet!

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.340
If you're a soldier, put the mission first!

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.290
Yeah...

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.000
Good point.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.150
He's absolutely right!

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.000
"Southwestward"

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.170
"7 hours after the Titan spotting"
"Western Team"

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.750
We're getting close to the wall now,
so there's no people living in the area.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.340
Right. That didn't take us very long.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.680
All right, let's head to the south.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.180
What for?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.690
There shouldn't be any 
villages south of here.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.650
We need to find the location
the wall was breached.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.190
We'll ride along the wall
from the west until we find it.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.110
But Christa and I don't have our battle gear.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.280
There's probably Titans
roaming everywhere to our south.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.200
It's very possible that
we'll become Titan fodder.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.530
Let the two of us withdraw from the front.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.620
Ymir...

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.630
You can't. I'll need somebody
to relay back a report.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.560
I know how you feel,
but you signed up for this as a soldier.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.770
Ymir.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.640
I'm fine with putting my life on the line.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.630
After all, I'm the one
who chose to join the Scouts.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.190
But... it's not the same for you.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.240
The only reason you joined
the Scouts was because--

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.160
Hmph! You think I did it for you?!

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.830
Then why are you even here?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.920
You kept trying to convince me
to join the Military Police.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.090
But then you gave that privilege to me!

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.930
There's no way I'm good enough
to make the top ten on skill alone.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.930
I'm sure if I asked anyone,
they'd say you deserved to be in it, not me.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.290
I don't know how you did it, but...

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.350
Why?

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.880
Why would you go that far for me?

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.570
Does it...

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.290
...have to do with my family?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.950
Yeah, it does.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.310
Christa...

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.460
Don't worry about it.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.710
The only reason I'm here...
is for myself and nothing else.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.300
I see...

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.910
Thank goodness.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.770
"9 hours after the Titan spotting"
"Eastern defensive line"

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.150
The target has come within range!

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.030
All cannons, prepare to fire!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.750
Not yet! Wait for the order!

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.330
Sir!

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.080
Fire!

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.540
Did I get 'em?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.440
You did it, Captain Rico!

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.940
At this rate, they'll 
never break our defense!

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.510
No... The Titans' strength 
is in their numbers.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.570
If they attack as a group,
this line won't stand a chance.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.380
But... what is it?

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.980
Something isn't...

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:03.990
This is strange...

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.710
Captain Hannes! Is something wrong?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.380
We haven't even spotted a single Titan yet.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.130
We've got to be getting 
close to the hole now.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.540
And yet, doesn't it seem
awful quiet around here?

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.880
Hopefully, we can sneak in and out
without stirring up a storm.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.580
"11 hours after the Titan spotting"

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.840

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.210
When will they show?

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.430
When will it happen?

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.540
At any second, they could
leap out from the shadows.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.560
No...

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:08.680
The closer we get to the hole,
the more inevitable it becomes.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.820
Damn it!

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.570
This is driving me crazy!

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.020
Did you follow the wall here, too?

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.600
Yeah. Where did you find the hole?

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.850
Huh?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.570
We didn't find anything to the west.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.360
Didn't you find it your way?

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.360
No...

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.590
There's no hole this way either.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.040
Is it possible we missed it?

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.130
No way.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.040
Not a hole big enough for Titans to use.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.050
Should we go back and look again?

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.310
We'll need to, but the horses
and the rest of us are exhausted.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.500
If only we had some moonlight...

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.190
Yeah...

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.610
What's that?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.440
Castle ruins?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.040
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Torches"
"Though seemingly primitive, torches do not extinguish when dropped, making them ideal for night operations.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.040
Due to their usefulness and long burning time,
materials to make torches are issued
as standard equipment in the Scout Regiment."

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:58.420
It looks like a mess, but we can
make it work for one night of rest.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.420
Right. Luckily the moon is out.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.690
Hange.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.290
Hey, four-eyes.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.450
Are your hobbies so boring that playing
with rocks is somehow fun for you?

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.450
Yeah. That's right.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.990
But this is no ordinary rock.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.960
It's a hardened fragment of skin
left behind by the Female Titan.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.460
Huh? It didn't disappear?

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.840
Right! Annie reverted from a Titan, but it's still
intact even though it broke off her body.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.670
It didn't evaporate. It didn't disappear.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.600
So I thought, "What if?"

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.680
When I compared it to a piece of the wall,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.600
its pattern and composition
were practically identical.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.730
In other words, the wall is
a barricade of humongous Titans.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.740
And if I'm right, the surface is
constructed with hardened Titan skin.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.780
That's exactly what Armin was saying...

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.740
Th-Then--

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.910
Let me finish, Armin.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.170
As it stands, we'll be hard pressed
to fill the hole in Wall Rose.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.340
That is, unless we can find
the perfect boulder to plug it.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.800
But if... But if Eren, 
in his transformed state,

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.940
could use the Titans' hardening ability
to seal the hole in the wall...

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.630
Use me...

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.020
...to seal the wall?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.480
It should be made of the same material.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.280
And seeing how the hardened section won't
evaporate, even after you revert from a Titan...

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.610
...it's possible...

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.080
I think it's well worth the risk to try.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.920
And assuming it really does work,
reclaiming Wall Maria is feasible, too.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:03.590
Up until now, we've had to transport
a large quantity of materials and supplies.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.220
That's why the need for outposts
past the wall limited our progress.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.430
But if we don't have to
accommodate supply wagons...

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.730
...we could quickly make 
our way to Shiganshina.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.360
What if we carried out the plan at night?

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.770
At night?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.860
Yes.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.730
During the night, when Titans can't move.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.860
I see...

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:29.010
If the group was small enough,
you could sneak all the way to Wall Maria.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.750
The current situation is 
as bad as it gets, but...

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.470
...we still have a glimmer of hope.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.750
Yes, but remember...

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.510
...it all depends on whether Eren
can seal the hole or not.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.510
I realize asking this 
hardly seems fair, but...

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.010
Think you can do it?

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.160
It doesn't matter what you think.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:07.280
You have to. There's no other choice.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.150
We're out of options.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.680
Our forces are struggling so desperately,
there's nothing else they can do.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.520
You have to succeed.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.960
I will!

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.210
I'll do whatever it takes to seal the wall!

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.500
Whatever it takes...

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.380
The basement...

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.560
My dad's basement...

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:40.560
If what my dad said was true,
we'll find the answers to everything there.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.660
It's Ehrmich District.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.880
Hey, keep moving.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.540
You'll end up like a little lost kid.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.780
Th-This is...

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.680
What did you expect you'd see?

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.460
This is what happens when the wall falls.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.100
Mommy! Daddy!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.910
Hey!

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.110
Where do you think you're going?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.110
Take a good look at the faces of people
who've lost everything.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.120
The faces of everyone you
and your people abandoned.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.100
If your church's wish comes true,
and Titans come flooding through the walls,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:49.260
we'll all be gobbled up in their stinking mouths
and die in the most miserable way possible.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.240
All of humanity, digested as one.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.430
Once we leave Ehrmich,
we'll be in Titan territory.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.850
Eren? Think you can ride a horse?

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.150
Yes. I feel fully recovered now.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.440
Yours is ready at the west lift. Let's hurry.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.370
Section Commander. We should hurry.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.280
Give me a minute, Moblit.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.460
Have you had a change of heart yet?

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.340
We don't have time for this!
You know, don't you?!

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.470
Will you talk, or won't you?!
Make up your mind already!

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.960
I cannot say anything.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.610
The other believers are the same as I,
and that will never change.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.270
Well thanks for nothing!

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.560
We're so grateful for all 
the help you've been!

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.560
It's too great a decision
for a single person to make.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.280
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.120
--This way.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.120
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.780
-Sir! Thank you!

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:57.830
--The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.630
Whose will?

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.660
God or something?

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.650
I cannot say anything.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.170
However,

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:12.200
I can inform you of a name, who under their
sacred will, we were instructed to monitor.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.670
Monitor?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.680
That person joined the Scout
Regiment as of this year.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.100
Their name is...

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.890
Excuse me!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.520
104th Cadet Corps!

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.820
Sasha Braus!

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.070
Her?

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:34.530
Who's that?

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.200
Um, this is for you, Section Commander.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.830
You must find her at once.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.960
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.240
That is all the information I can share.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.210
The rest I leave in your hands.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.590
If she's in the 104th, then she's deep
in the front lines right now.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.510
Let's go!

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.740
We need to hurry!

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.350
Wait!

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.540
Ouch...

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.110
Sasha?!

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.650
What are you doing here?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.070
Upon my arrival, I gave my report
to the Commander!

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.490
Afterwards, I was entrusted to deliver
this message to the Section Commander!

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.880
Message? Thank you. Good work.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.620
So, who is this girl in the 104th?

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.880
She's the smallest one of us.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.670
She's got long golden hair.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.990
Um, and...

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.590
She's cute.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.590
She's always hanging around Ymir.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.510
Ymir?

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.990
What's the meaning of this?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.920
Ymir...

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980
You...

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.440
Everyone, wake up!

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.230
Get to the tower! Quickly!

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.000
I couldn't see them in the darkness,
but then the moon...

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.910
Why? Why can they move?

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.720
It's been so long since the sun set!

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.330
What's going on here?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.220
Hey! Look at that!

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.770
It's huge! What the hell is it? A Titan?

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.730
No, it's more like...

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.560
It's like a beast!

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.410
Right?

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:43.470
It's... headed for the wall!

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.370
Everyone understand?

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.000
Yes!

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.710
We've got to go!

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.000
Calm down, Eren.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.270
You all listen, too.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.260
We're going our own ways now.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.550
The rest is up to you.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.890
Erwin may have thrown together your squad,
but everything's riding on you.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.560
Got it, Armin?

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.150
Work with Hange and combine your knowledge.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.690
Y-Yes sir!

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:19.370
Mikasa.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.700
I don't know why you're
so attached to Eren, but...

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:27.200
...use the utmost of your ability
to protect Eren at all costs.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.340
Yes, sir! Of course!

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.210
And finally...

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.080
Eren.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.340
Hey, wait!

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.730
Wait, wait, wait up!

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.760
Don't you be coming in here!

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.850
You're fricking kidding me.
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.640
I'd be drinking right now 
if it wasn't for you!

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.520
This is all your fault!

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.560
Stand back, rookies.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.230
Leave it to us.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.400
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.070
Let's go!

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.650
And finally, Eren.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.430
Learn how to restrain yourself.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.460
Don't succumb to rage
and lose sight of the goal.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:35.310
We can't afford another mistake.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:36.740
Yes, sir!

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.380
There's a tower nearby
where we can assess the wall.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.780
It's in an abandoned castle to the southwest.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.160
We'll ride to Utgard Castle.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.400
While searching for the Titans' breach in
the wall, the Scouts arrive at Utgard Castle.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:54.160
Their rest is cut short by Titans who move
even under the darkness of night.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.330
The Scouts fight back gallantly.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:04.630
As the Titans' invasion presses within the
castle, Reiner recollects a scene of his past.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.600
"Soldier"

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.780
Next episode: "Soldier."
