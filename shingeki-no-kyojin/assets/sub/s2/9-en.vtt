WEBVTT

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.650
Let's move!

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.540
Hange?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.620
G-Get me a horse.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.610
Section Commander! Where 
are you trying to go?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.010
To that village where we captured
the Titan who couldn't walk.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.510
You mean Ragako?

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.590
I need to see it... with my own eyes.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.180
Don't say something so ridiculous!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.060
Your body can't take 
riding a horse right now!

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.440
I have a hunch... that 
we need to investigate...

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.570
All right.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.280
I'll go there on my own,
so you just stay here and faint or something.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.000
Spread out! Take formation 
to locate any enemies!

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.050
Eren...

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.020
"Opening"

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.110
Oh, Eren?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.020
You're awake?

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.550
What the hell?!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.790
My arms!

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.970
Eren.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.040
Look at me. I'm in the same shape as you.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.940
Guess the both of us are having a bad day.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.720
Ymir...

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.650
Why... don't I have any arms?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.940
That's my bad.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.720
I'm the one who did that.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.860
I kinda was in a hurry.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.590
When I rushed to bite your nape,
I neglected to take your arms into account.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.540
I see...

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.800
I... must've lost.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.270
Eren, stop!

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.520
Hold your horses, Eren.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.020
Take a good look around us.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.190
We're in the giant forest within Wall Maria.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.360
It's not even close to any of the walls.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.100
In other words, we're 
deep in Titan territory.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.620
Take a look.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.620
I think that one down there's an Abnormal.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.290
It looks like he's just lounging around,
but he's not taking his eyes off us.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.090
There's a lot of small ones down there, too.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.900
That alone is dangerous.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.220
Over that way's another big one.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.930
He staring at us, but won't come any closer.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.720
I bet you that one's a scaredy-cat.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.980
And then you've got these chumps.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.230
Those dirty bastards.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.770
They're the only ones with any ODM gear on.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.990
Reiner's wearing gear he took from you.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.120
So I don't think changing into a Titan
at this point is going to solve anything.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.000
Not only can they do that, but they can
escape high into the trees as well.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.240
Those two aside, there's 
Titans all around us.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.070
Escaping out of this Titan territory
would be tough, even with Titan powers.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.580
Understand?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.430
There's nothing to gain by acting up.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.240
No.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.930
You two can't even turn 
into Titans right now.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.310
So don't count on that to help you.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.440
Your body is at its limit.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.980
It's taking everything you've got
to repair the damage.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.190
Are you stupid?

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.990
Why the hell would I trust anything
coming out of your mouth?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.580
Well...

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.210
It's not like I know the specifics
behind how Titan powers work.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.460
Unlike you guys, I'm 
pretty clueless about it.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.710
Hey, Reiner.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.220
You said you would talk once Eren woke up.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.260
It's about time one of you says
what you plan to do with us.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.560
We'll take you to our hometown.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.190
I realize that you're not
going to listen and do as I say.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.070
But like Ymir was saying,
this place is swarming with Titans.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.200
We could beat the shit out 
of each other right now,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.950
but when we're weak, the other Titans
would just come and eat us.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.020
So until nightfall, when the Titans can't move,
we have no choice but to wait here.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.580
Whether you try to run and escape from us...

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.100
...or don't and we take you away...

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.920
...either way, we wait for night.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.180
Why didn't you stay
the Armored Titan and run home?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.600
What's the point of stopping here?

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.520
Too tired and had to take a break?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.350
Why don't you use your imagination?

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.110
Let's think...

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.740
If I waited for an opening 
and became a Titan,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.910
running away from here doesn't seem
like it would pose a challenge.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.950
But will I be able to transform
into a Titan in the first place?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.170
Reiner said that I can't...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.570
And I have to consider that even Reiner
had to stop here to take a break.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.030
If my Titan form isn't strong enough,

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.840
does that mean I'll just 
get eaten by the others?

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.890
Are you simply waiting here 
for it to become night?

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.850
Maybe I am.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.690
No... There's no way they'd 
wait until nightfall.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.500
They're not going to give our bodies
the chance to fully recover.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.480
They'll make their move
while we're still powerless.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.080
At this rate, I can't do anything.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.450
At this rate...

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.510
What happened to everybody?

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.360
Where are the Scouts?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.340
Don't tell me they're coming this way...

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.300
If they try to help,
no one's gonna make it back safely.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.410
What's it matter?

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.390
Those Titans at the castle
moved just fine at night.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.750
Won't these Titans, too?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.560
The Titans here can't move at night.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.530
You should know all about it, Ymir.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.280
Speaking of which,
why can Ymir turn into a Titan?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.490
I don't think she's like me,
who knew nothing about it.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.490
Is she on our side?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.390
I don't even know what her goal is yet.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.640
She's hard enough to understand as it is.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.760
I've made up my mind.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.510
Right now, what I need is information.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.010
I need to figure out
everything I can from these guys.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:02.270
And then I'll make my escape.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.480
To do that, I need...

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.360
...to suppress all my emotions...

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.470
...and for my body to heal.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.950
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.950
Titan Regeneration"
"Those with the power to become
 Titans possess an inherent ability to regenerate.
 Their limbs can be dismembered and their internal organs destroyed,
 but as long as they survive, their bodies will regenerate back to normal given sufficient time."

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.880
Titan spotted at three 
'o clock! Fire the smoke!

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.880
Smoke shell confirmed on the right wing!

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.340
Do not change direction!

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.840
Have the right wing merge
with the center and hold course!

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.430
We only have until sunset!

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.300
We must take the shortest possible path!

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.640
Mikasa.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.680
Hey, Mikasa!

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.480
Mikasa!

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.690
Stop pushing so hard.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.360
You're drifting near the vanguard.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.440
It'll ruin the whole formation.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:58.280
I know how you feel, 
but... didn't I tell you?

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.700
Eren won't get taken away
without putting up a fight.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.070
Don't you agree?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.040
You know he'll never give up.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.210
So it's up to us to stay calm
and be there when he needs us.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.930
Just like we did back then.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.530
Reiner.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.380
You got any water?

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.000
If I don't get some soon,
I'm going to dry up and die.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.030
Even if it's a matter of life and death,

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.250
there's nothing we can 
do given our situation.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.010
He's completely right...
This situation couldn't be any shittier.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.140
Speaking of which...

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.970
Ever since the Titans showed 
up yesterday morning,

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.810
we've been working our asses off.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.690
With nothing to eat or drink
and not even a wink of sleep.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.980
Fortunately, the wall 
wasn't broken or anything.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.780
So I think we deserve to 
take a break for once.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:23.050
We'll see about getting promoted later.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.120
Reiner...

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.080
What? We've done plenty enough to deserve it.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.750
I think we've performed outstandingly,
considering all we've been put through.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.260
I know soldiers like us are expected
to fulfill their duties, but...

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.000
I think we've all earned it.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.280
Reiner...

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.100
What in the world are you talking about?

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.730
Huh? What do you mean?

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.070
I'm not saying we go demand to be
promoted to captains or anything.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.030
That's... not what I mean.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.080
Oh, yeah. Where did you 
all get that cannon from?

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.830
That really saved my ass.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.710
It's a good thing Christa 
helped me after that.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.630
To be honest, I think she has a thing for me.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.500
Hey...

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.880
Now that I think about it,
Christa has always treated me especially--

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.130
Hey!

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.140
You bastard... You've gotta be kidding me.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.230
Huh?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.900
What are you so angry about, Eren?

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.020
Did I... say something wrong?

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.540
If you want to die, just keep talking!

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.400
Hold up, Eren.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.410
This isn't normal, no 
matter how you look at it.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.940
Isn't that right, Bertholdt?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.920
If you know something,
quit with the silence and come out and say it.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.710
Huh?

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.400
Reiner...

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.500
You're not... a soldier, remember?

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.270
You and I...

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.470
...we're warriors.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:21.280
Reiner!

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.110
What are you doing?!

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.590
Hey...

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.160
Why...

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.600
...is Marco...

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.780
...getting eaten?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.390
Right.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.720
That's... how it is.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.010
Huh?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.540
What's he doing?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.700
More or less, I think I've figured it out.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.780
I thought it was strange.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.760
Why would the guy who broke the wall
risk his life to save Conny?

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.040
Everything he does is contradictory,
but he doesn't realize it himself.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.210
I don't know why he
ended up like this, but probably...

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.550
He was originally a warrior
whose goal was to break the wall, but...

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:30.260
...after pretending to 
be a soldier for so long,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.220
he lost sight of who he was
and couldn't tell which one was real.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.410
No...

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.620
Unable to bear the weight 
of his sins, he convinced

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.150
himself he was a soldier protecting the wall

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.360
to maintain emotional balance
within his own heart.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.610
And in the end, he believed it.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.120
As a result, his heart was split
and his memories broken.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.830
This must not be the first time
Reiner's talked and made no sense...

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.770
...judging by Bertholdt's grim expression.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.170
It's amazing, really.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.590
For someone excessively honest like you to--

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.550
Enough!

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.950
Shut your mouth.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.260
Sorry about that.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.680
I might've pried too much.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.150
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.900
Why are you pretending to be the victim here?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.750
What's your deal?

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.660
That day, what the hell were
you thinking when you talked to us?

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.160
Tell me, Bertholdt.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.420
I'm talking to you, you damn lackey.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.170
I told you everything...
while you looked at me right in the eyes.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.010
About the day my mother was eaten alive...

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.470
Stop!

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.550
Isn't that right?

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.770
Thanks to the piece of wall you kicked
that went flying straight into my house,

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.690
my mother couldn't escape or run away.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.700
You remember, right? I told you my story.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.860
What were you thinking?

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.660
What were you thinking when I told you?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.590
Back then...

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.060
...I thought... I felt sorry for you.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.260
Oh...

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.260
I see...

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.970
You guys...

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.970
You guys...

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.180
...are neither soldiers nor warriors.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.980
You're just murderers.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.940
You're psychotic mass-murderers

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.650
who've killed countless innocent people
who never did anything wrong!

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.610
You don't think I know that?!

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.820
I don't need you to point that out to me!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.240
Then don't pretend to have emotions
like you're one of us!

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.910
You guys aren't even human anymore!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.120
It's you two who've turned
this world into a living hell!

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.920
Does that make you happy, murderers?!

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.710
What are you after by calling us murderers?!

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.260
Do you want us to regret it?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.800
Do you want us to apologize?!

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.220
Would that give you satisfaction?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.180
The people you thought 
we were no longer exist!

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.040
If screaming will make you feel better,
then scream your damn head off!

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.730
That's right...

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.990
I'm still...

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.260
...too naïve.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.260
I've...

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.420
...gotta do what I can.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.880
Do what I can...

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.420
...to make you guys...

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.930
...suffer and die in the worst way possible.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.130
You've got it coming.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.600
You can't be serious.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.370
Huh?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.690
Quit it, Eren.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.360
If you keep saying childish crap like that,
I've got no hope for you.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.860
Huh?!

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.450
Hey, Reiner.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.410
What's the deal with that monkey?

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.920
Monkey? What do you mean?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.090
Hmm? You don't know?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.530
That's surprising, given how much you two

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.680
stared at it with stars in your 
eyes like two little brats.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.350
That monkey...

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.950
What's that? A monkey?

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.850
Just listen.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:55.420
That monkey Beast Titan
is what caused this recent fiasco.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.860
It made Titans rise up from within the wall.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.870
I wonder if he was trying 
to assess our strength.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.710
That's where these guys are trying to get.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.790
If you guys get to him,
you'll be able to go back home, right?

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:15.710
You... knew this?

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.380
What do you know?! Tell me everything!

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.640
Just wait. I've got circumstances of my own.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.140
What the hell do you mean by that?!

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:28.350
Eren... if you think killing these two
will bring an end to everything...

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:30.600
...you're gravely mistaken.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.440
Huh?!

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.730
Then who's the enemy?!

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:34.770
Enemy?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.610
If I said that, the--

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.570
Ymir!

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.780
Do you think there's any 
future for this world?

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.520
If you know so much,
think about what you want to do.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.460
It's not out of the question
for you to join our side.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.120
And trust you?

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.840
Yeah, right. You two don't even trust me.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.860
Wrong. We can trust you.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.970
Because your one goal...

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.170
...is to protect Christa.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.350
When it comes to her,
we should be able to trust one another.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.480
You might think that I'm joking, but...

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:15.850
Is it that hard for you to believe that

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.300
we might want the best for Christa as well?

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.160
Or... would you rather put your hopes
in Eren and rely on him over us?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.360
Huh?!

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.450
You're probably thinking your best chance
is to use Eren to escape from here.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.630
Because if you're taken by us,
there's little chance for your rescue.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.760
To be honest, that's pretty much true.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.300
Even if you come with us,
we can't guarantee your safety.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.140
But if it's Christa we're talking about,
we might be able to do something for her.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.900
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.150
It's up to you to decide.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.950
There's no future for this world?

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.780
Why's that? What's this about a monkey?

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.350
What's going on?

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.490
Hey!

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.000
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.920
Ymir!

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.140
Who knows...

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.350
It's settled then.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.890
Too bad, Eren.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.360
The Scouts... are already...

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.060
Dammit!

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.540
Shit!

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.620
Damn you, Ymir.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.780
There's just one hour left until sunset.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.230
As sunset swiftly approaches...

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.360
...the Scout Regiment closes in, intent on
rescuing Eren from Reiner and Bertholdt.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.120
The pair plot to make their escape,
fleeing by use of ODM gear.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:03.700
However, reflecting on her past and emotions,
Ymir offers a plan of her own.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.510
"Children"

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.240
Next episode: "Children."
