WEBVTT

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
"Soldier"

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.250
Stand back, rookies.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.600
Leave it to us.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.600
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.270
Let's go!

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.740
"2 hours earlier"

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.540
Looks like someone was here recently.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.000
That's odd for a place this near the wall.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.290
Some bandits probably used it as a base.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.970
It said "Ruins of Utgard Castle"
on one of the signs.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.240
Who would have thought
there was a castle around here?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.060
Hey, check it out. Look what I found.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.180
Gelgar... Is that booze I see?

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.730
Yeah.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.110
What the heck does it say?

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.280
You're not gonna drink it now, are you?

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.530
Don't be stupid.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.650
Not at a time like this.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.660
Convenient... All this contraband
to enjoy for ourselves.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.490
Now you're making us sound like the bandits.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.540
You rookies should try to get some rest.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.720
Titans won't be roaming around at this hour,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.010
but the rest of us will 
take turns keeping watch.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.040
We'll leave from here
four hours before daybreak.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.510
Um...

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.640
What if the wall isn't
actually broken after all?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.730
The Titans... Where could 
they be invading from?

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.500
Finding the answer to that...
is our job for tomorrow.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.990
But what if--? Maybe it's not nearly
as bad as we thought from the start.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.210
I'm just saying, but...

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.710
Yeah... There's barely 
any Titans around here.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.500
If the wall was really broken, that is.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.550
The only group we've really seen
was during the initial sighting.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.810
Conny? What about your village?

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.690
It was destroyed.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.480
Crushed to sticks and rubble by Titans.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.440
I see... How awful...

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.070
But nobody there was eaten.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.900
I think they all escaped,
so there's that to be thankful for.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.660
Wasn't the village destroyed?

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.040
The houses and stuff were wrecked,
but the villagers made it out safely.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.730
If anyone was eaten, then...

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.420
...there would've been blood and remains.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.960
But there wasn't any of that,
so it's the only explanation.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.350
Still... I can't stop thinking about it...

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.130
There was that Titan at my house.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.100
It couldn't move on its own,
but it was lying right on top of my house.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.850
But it's weird...

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.370
I don't know why, but it
reminded me of my mother...

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.570
What does that--?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.160
Conny... You're still saying that? You--

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.330
What an idiot!

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.080
You think your mother
might have been that Titan?!

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.830
Then how come you're so damn short, huh?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.070
Come on, Conny! I knew you were pretty stupid,
but this is taking it to another level!

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.720
Would you just shut up?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.300
This is absurd.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.850
If this theory of yours is correct,
that means your father had to be a Titan, too.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.100
Otherwise, you know...

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.940
They couldn't do it--

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.520
Shut up! Go to sleep, you wench!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.990
Ymir? What are you doing?

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.750
Prowling at night, Reiner? Come to see me?

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.500
I'm shocked. I was under the impression
that you had no interest in women.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.970
Yeah. And it doesn't seem like
you have interest in guys, either.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.600
I thought I'd use this time to scavenge
for something that might fill my stomach.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.480
This'll probably end up being my last meal.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.440
About Conny's village...

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.980
Were you joking around on purpose?

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.480
I'd appreciate if you did more of that.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.030
So that he doesn't keep
worrying about his family.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.470
What are you talking about?

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.330
This might do the trick.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.290
Not that I like herring, but--

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.420
Is there any more?

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.290
Could I see it?

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.500
Go for it.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.840
Canned food, huh?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.020
What... are these letters?

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.350
I can't read any of it.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.520
This says herring on it?

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.260
You... are... able to read this language?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.450
Ymir...

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.610
You're...

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.450
Everyone, wake up!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.040
Get to the tower! Quickly!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.460
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.290
I'd be drinking right now 
if it wasn't for you!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.170
This is all your fault!

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.170
Let's go!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.310
Get your damn hands away from me!

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.020
You piece of shit!

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.400
Look at that. Those little ones
got crushed by the fatty.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.580
Dumb-asses.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.240
That was way too reckless!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.500
Couldn't you have avoided that
without wasting your blades?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.920
That's just how I do things.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.000
You better chalk that one up as an assist.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.210
How heroic of you.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.720
I'll think about it.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.560
I'm too late...

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.020
The door is bashed in!

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.770
The Titans broke through.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.650
Go back down and form some sort of barricade.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.860
If you can't block them,
retreat back up here as a last resort.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.080
But that doesn't mean we'll
be able to help you though.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.330
I'm not sure if we'll still be
alive if it comes to that.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.170
We've all gotta do what we're trained to do.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.340
Give it all we've got till we die!

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.920
Understand?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.750
Got it!

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.360
I'll go see how far they've come through!

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.390
You guys grab boards or rods or whatever!

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.680
Bring everything you can carry!

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:01.270
Reiner!

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.850
Hey!

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.730
Wait up, Reiner! Hold on!

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.150
Who does he think he is,
always taking the most dangerous job?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.320
Come on, man!

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.070
Yeah, that's a bad habit of his.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.410
They're still below.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.540
Well, it's still locked...

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.840
But it's not like this old wooden door
will keep them out for long.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.690
They're here!

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.110
Bring something, quick!

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.830
Is this it?

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.800
Will this be it?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.730
Is this the end?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.010
No...

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.350
It can't be.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:28.770
I won't let it happen!

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.440
I'm definitely going home!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.650
Reiner!

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.450
Reiner! Are you okay?!

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.830
Yeah!

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.410
Bertholdt, we're gonna survive and go home.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.380
We're going back to our hometown for sure.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.170
Right... Right!

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:55.880
We're going home!

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.720
Reiner! Bertholdt!

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.880
Hey, that's...

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.220
Have powder? A cannonball?

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.680
Hell no! You'll just have to
take the whole thing!

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.100
Out of the way!

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.000
Looks like that worked out, miraculously.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200
Yeah...

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.120
It's not getting up from that.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.460
Not one of that size.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.630
What now? All we have is this knife.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:36.880
Should I cut off its nape?

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.300
Don't even try.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.340
You'll get hurt if it grabs you.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.890
F-For now, let's retreat back upstairs.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.510
There could be more
than just one that got inside.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.350
Conny!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.940
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Utgard Castle"

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.940
"It is unknown when this ancient castle turned ruins was built.
 The hefty cannons contained within its walls possess substantial defensive power,
 but for what enemy they were placed here for is anyone's guess."

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.240
Conny!

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.460
Reiner!

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.390
Uh, Reiner...

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.850
Don't tell me...

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.980
You're gonna jump out the window with it?!

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.980
I've got no other choice!

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:35.850
Wait!

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.940
If I can just slice open its jaw...

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.320
You're free!

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.570
What will we do if another comes through?

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.300
We won't be lucky enough 
to kill a second one.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.430
Yeah, I'm with you there.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.320
Sorry... I'm sorry.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.900
I think it's broken.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.320
Yeah, just my luck.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.720
We'll need a splint and a bandage.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.610
I know.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.410
Sorry...

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.920
All I've got is this dirty cloth.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.840
Sorry.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.130
No, it helps.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.840
Gotta marry her.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.510
Are you all right, Reiner?

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.350
Yeah, I guess.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.560
By the way, Christa.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.770
My hand got scraped up a bit, too...

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.320
Huh? Just spit on it or something.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.360
Sorry about that, Reiner.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.850
It seems like you're always saving my ass.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.830
Speaking of which, Annie risked
her life to save me, too.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.780
I've gotta pay you back sometime.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.910
Not really. It's...

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.120
It's the normal thing to do.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.720
Because we're soldiers.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.210
I'm not so sure about that.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.240
I doubt I could ever be that brave.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.010
Hey, Bertholdt.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.900
Has Reiner always been like this?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.430
No... In the past, Reiner 
was more of a warrior.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.430
Unlike now.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.060
What's that mean?

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.770
What do you mean by warrior?

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.940
For now, let's try to gather
anything useful we can find.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.320
That way when we die,
we can do so without regrets.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.660
That's the Scouts for you...

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.710
They're on a different level
from the other soldiers.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.170
That's mostly it for the big ones.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.340
It's a good thing we have this tower.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.970
Yeah, we might actually survive.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.430
We'll go check on the recruits!

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.430
Okay.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.480
What's that sound?

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.020
The horses!

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.450
Huh?

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.860
Again?!

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.540
What the hell is that sound?!

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.370
Lynne! Henning!

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.420
What was that?!

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.670
It's no use.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.800
They both died instantly.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.680
This can't be...

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.750
It's him! The one that
walked off towards the wall!

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.340
That Beast Titan did this!

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.270
A group of Titans approaching!
More than twice the number from earlier!

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.730
What'd you say?!

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.030
Their timing is too perfect,
like it's part of some strategy.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.280
I get the feeling they've been
toying with us from the start.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.480
This is bad! My gas is all but gone!

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.030
Did I get 'em?

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.060
This tower won't hold much longer.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.540
I only have a small amount of gas left.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.460
What about you?

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.410
No gas here, and I used up all of my blades.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.550
Those blunt ones the last you have left?

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:18.550
Yeah...

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.220
How many did the four of us kill?

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.520
I don't know. I didn't 
have the luxury to count.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.830
You know what? I think I did
a pretty good job myself.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.620
But the thing is...

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.410
I wish I could have a drink before I go.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.370
Gelgar...

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.870
Sorry, Nanaba.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.660
I must've hit my head...

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.290
I can't hold...

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.670
...any longer.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.420
Gelgar!

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.020
Gelgar!

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.020
Damn it! Is that all I've got?

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.440
Thank God...

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.600
H-How cruel.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.040
This just isn't fair.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.110
Who the hell drank the rest of this bottle?!

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.450
They got him.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.700
Quit it, Christa!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.660
The tower's about to crumble! You'll fall!

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.920
But they're dying in our place!

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.330
--Nanaba...

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.170
--No! No!
--Nanaba...

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.130
--No! No!
--And Gelgar...

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.750
Father, stop!

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:16.960
Father!

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.720
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.700
Father! No!

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.260
Damn it all to hell!

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:30.850
Hey... Do we gotta wait here now until
the tower falls and we get eaten alive?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.110
Is there nothing we can do about it?!

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.360
This sucks...

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:39.990
We'll be wiped out without
even finishing our mission.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.490
I... want to keep fighting, too.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:47.950
If only I had some sort of weapon,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:50.620
then I could fight and die alongside them.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.830
Christa... You're still 
saying things like that?

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.210
Don't you dare use their deaths.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.630
They didn't die so you'd have
an excuse to get yourself killed.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.640
That's not... That's not what I...

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.140
You're not like Conny and the Scouts!

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.640
They don't want to die, 
but you don't even care.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.400
All you want to do is die in a way
that makes you seem like a hero.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.900
Th-That's not...

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.900
Conny.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.450
Give me that knife you had.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.370
Huh? My knife?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:25.740
Just hand it over.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.450
Fine. Here.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.460
Thanks.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.710
What do you want it for?

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.750
Hmm?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.500
Well, you see...

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.010
I'm going to fight with this.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.470
Ymir... What are you planning?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.800
Who knows? I don't even know myself.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:50.640
Ymir...

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:52.690
Christa.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.220
You've probably forgotten 
all about it by now...

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.360
But this might be the end, so...

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.740
Try to remember... that promise we made
training on that snowy mountain.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.830
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.760
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.260
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.480
Remember our promise, Christa.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.820
Ymir! Wait!

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.870
Ymir!

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.430
"Live a life you're proud of."

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:49.280
Leaving Christa and those words behind,
Ymir unleashes the power of the Titans.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:55.520
Between Ymir and Christa is a
powerful promise they made in the past.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.250
As Ymir battles and puts 
her life on the line,

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.790
Christa screams out, casting aside
the persona she's kept for so long.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.560
