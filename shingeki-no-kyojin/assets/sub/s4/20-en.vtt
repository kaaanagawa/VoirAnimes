00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.970
These are... Dad's memories.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.760
He sure looks happy.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.980
For someone who cast his previous
family and friends into hell, that is.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.900
Why show me this?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.570
So that you understand:

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.700
How Grisha Jaeger brainwashed and
planted the seeds of nationalism in you.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.500
I'll show you as much as it takes.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.470
Must be nice, Grisha.
Here, you can live out a happy life

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.220
without anyone to chastise you
for forgetting your first family...

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.730
Even if you forget about
the son you already had.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.320
Let's go.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920
Next one.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.090
Look, Eren. This is the true him.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.220
He used his job as a doctor
to get close to those in power--

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.900
to hunt down the King
and steal the Founding Titan.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.570
If he slipped up,
his wife and son would suffer.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.200
But he continued nevertheless.
Do you know why?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.080
Because he's an asshole who'd toss
his family into a ditch to restore Eldia.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.840
I get it now. I was wrong.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.050
I never should've been born.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.670
I'm no longer brainwashed.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.140
We have all the time in the world.
No need to rush.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.670
You're kidding.
He tracked it down this soon?

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.300
What is this place?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.090
The King of the walls' hideout.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.550
That can't be.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.850
Grisha stole the Founding Titan
on the day the walls fell.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.520
That's years from now.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.520
I see... He loved his second son enough
to delay his Restorationist mission.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.950
A stark contrast from me. It seems
he learned from his past mistakes.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.290
However, you moved exactly
how Father wanted you to.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.250
The original you is gone.
Sooner or later, you'll see.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.340
I'm sorry...

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.810
I'm sorry, Zeke...

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.190
Zeke...

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.440
Zeke...?

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.280
Is that you...?

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.920
Don't be silly. That old, bearded man
can't possibly be Zeke.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.130
This is just a dream.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.430
What...?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.390
Next one.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.720
Next memory, Zeke.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.940
"Memories of the Future"

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.700
At this point, you're nine years old.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.950
Grisha loved you and let you grow freely.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.920
To think, you were never
brainwashed by him...

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.880
I told you this was pointless before we
wandered for years in his memories.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.850
In that case, why did you betray me?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.430
Your father told you nothing
and made you inherit a Titan,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.980
yet you're fighting just like he wanted?

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.860
Eren, why do you oppose
ending the conflict?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.320
What were you planning to do
with the Founder's power?

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.120
I am...

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.410
...who I've always been...

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.710
...from the moment I was born.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.590
You may have thought we were
the same, but you're wrong.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:22.640
Rather than letting someone steal
my freedom, I'll steal theirs first.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.310
--Do you have any idea what you've done?!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.730
--My dad didn't make me like that.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.280
--I got rid of some dangerous animals!
They just happened to look like people!

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.530
--I've been this way since birth.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.310
--Eren!

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.390
--Since birth...?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.030
--They would've been long gone
by the time the Military Police arrived!

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.700
--You won't find the pathetic little
brother you were hoping for in me.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.870
--It would've been too late! â€‹

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.750
--Nor a convenient little brother
to share your emotional scars with.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:44.750
--Even so, you were just lucky, Eren! â€‹

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.920
--All I see is a man
who can't accept himself

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.920
--The way you casually threw your life away is what I'm angry about!

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.720
until he denies his father's wish
to restore Eldia.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.520
A pathetic man still haunted
by his dead father.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.110
In that case, said man
is grateful to his father.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.150
For the father's actions
opened his son's eyes

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:16.070
so he may save the world
from the threat of Eldia.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.330
In a way, it's that father
who saved the world.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.210
Don't you think that's a bit ironic, Eren?

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.670
It's warm.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:40.930
Listen, Eren. I have the power
of the Founder in my hand.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.930
I can carry out the
euthanization plan at any time.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:50.610
But I will never abandon you.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.690
Just like Mr. Ksaver did for me,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:02.410
before I save the world,
I want to save you.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:14.550
"Humanity has not perished," huh?

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.510
Those are some hefty
last words to leave behind.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.700
We're home.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.950
Welcome back.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.630
Wow, Eren! You actually worked hard!

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.380
Yeah...

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.590
What do you want?

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.300
Your ear's red.
That shows that you're lying.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.310
You had Mikasa help you, didn't you?

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.600
Oh? You're leaving, Dad?
Is it for work?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.690
Yes. Some checkups in the interior.
It'll take a couple of days.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.450
Eren says he wants to
join the Scout Regiment.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.200
Mikasa! I told you not to say anything!

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.660
Eren! What are you thinking?!

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.960
Do you have any idea how many
people have died outside the walls?!

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.380
--Y-Yeah, I know!
--Then...!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:39.720
Eren. Why do you want to go out there?

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.220
I want to know what
the outside world is like!

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.560
I don't want to live my entire life
in ignorance inside the walls!

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.350
Plus, if no one else is willing
to take their place,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.900
then the lives of all who've
died will be for nothing!

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.570
I see.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.490
My boat's about to leave.
I better get going.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.740
Hold on, Dear!
Talk some sense into Eren!

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:13.710
Carla. Words can't hold
back human curiosity.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.040
Eren.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.420
When I get back, I'll show you the
basement I've kept secret all this time.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.510
Really?!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.020
Take care!

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:53.120
I'm an Eldian that came
from outside the walls!

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.540
I'm a Subject of Ymir just like all you!

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The Coordinate"
"The place where all 'Paths' intersect. There, time is both instant and infinite."

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.380
King of the walls!

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.390
Please, you have to kill
the Titans attacking the walls!

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:15.600
Before my wife and children...!
Before the people of the walls are eaten!

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.290
We mustn't escape our sins.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.250
Judgment day has come
for the Subjects of Ymir.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.550
When it comes to great power,
people are weak.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.590
I realized something from
the Great Titan War:

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:51.180
We mustn't allow the Power of the Titans
to fall into people's hands.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.270
If the Founder's power falls
again into weak hands,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.850
the world shall again become hell.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:06.030
To save the world, we must accept
our sins and welcome our ruin.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:09.450
That girl and I are on the same page.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.910
But this whole family
is slaughtered by Grisha.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:20.790
You once said you saw this memory
and were disgusted with him.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.380
Was that a lie, too?

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.130
My house is right where
the wall was broken!

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.640
I live there with my wife,
son, and daughter!

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.520
The people of the walls don't
know about their ancestor's sins!

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.190
Because you erased
all of their memories!

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:46.940
You think the ignorant getting eaten
by Titans is atonement?!

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.990
No. No matter how much we repent,

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:56.500
it won't bring back any of
the lives that Eldians stole.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:04.500
However, we can prevent more lives
from being stolen beyond the walls.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.010
If we remain ignorant
and accept the world's hatred,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.810
it's only us Eldians who need to die.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.060
It's pointless to try and persuade me.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.400
And even if you steal the
Founding Titan from me, you can't--

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.030
I know. I know I can't use
the Founding Titan's power.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.120
Huh?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.490
Each of the Nine Titans
has its own special trait--

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:41.750
including the Attack Titan within me.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:48.130
For ages, the inheritors of the Attack
Titan have never bowed to anyone.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:55.050
And I know the reason why:
To fight the King's self-righteousness!

00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:00.640
Yes. We were led by our
memories--all for this moment.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:07.320
The Attack Titan can glimpse into
the memories of its future inheritors.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:13.280
In other words, it's able
to know the future.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:23.250
Know... the future?
What does he mean, Eren?

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.670
The Attack Titan's special trait?
I've never heard about--

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.920
I knew you weren't aware of that, too.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.390
And seeing how you're bound
by the vow renouncing war,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.020
you can't fully use the
Founding Titan's power either.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.600
This is where I eat the Founder
and end the royal bloodline!

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.530
That future is already decided!

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.030
Run!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.170
I can't.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:19.140
I can't... kill children.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:25.060
I'm... a doctor who saves lives.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:32.740
Impossible... Grisha's supposed to take
the Founder and slaughter this family.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:38.870
The past... can't just... change...

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.330
What are you doing, Frieda?!
Hurry and kill that man!

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.000
The Founder is unmatched! Kill him!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.290
Don't let him leave this place alive!

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:52.500
Hurry and kill him, Sis!

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.090
Our paradise will be destroyed!

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.300
Frieda! You've gotta protect us!

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.520
--Sis!
--Frieda!

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.400
What are you doing? Stand up, Dad.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:17.860
Did you forget what you came here to do?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.080
To avenge your little sister
eaten by dogs.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:30.170
For your comrades. Dina.
Kruger. To avenge them.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.880
You keep moving forward.
Even if you die. Even after death.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:48.020
Aren't you the one who started this story?

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.950
I killed them!

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:47.040
Even the little kids!
With my own hands!

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:54.750
Eren! I killed the Reiss!
All but their father!

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.550
Are you happy now?!

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.760
Is this what you wanted?!

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.010
Will Eldia really be saved
because of this?!

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.610
Why won't you show me everything?

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:21.200
The wall being destroyed...
The day it happens...

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.160
If Carla is safe...

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.700
Was this really the only way?

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.630
You're there, aren't you, Zeke?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.490
From here on, things won't go your way.
Only Eren will get what he wants.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.590
--What... did you say?

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:50.820
--I saw Eren's memories
of what comes next.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.680
But I never imagined
it would be so terrible.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.530
Zeke...?

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.940
Is that you?!

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.860
How you've grown!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.660
I'm sorry... I was a terrible father.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.500
The things I put you through
were so cruel.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:22.050
Zeke... I love you.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:28.970
If only I had spent more time with you...

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.240
Father...

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.120
Zeke...

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.250
Please, stop Eren.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:46.650
The story of those who opposed,
fought, and moved forward.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:51.740
Just who was it that started their story?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "From You, 2,000 Years Ago."
