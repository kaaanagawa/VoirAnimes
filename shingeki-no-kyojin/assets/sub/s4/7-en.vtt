WEBVTT

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.350
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.690
Eren!

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.820
What?!

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.820
Was that him?! Is that... Ackermann?!

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.120
You're kidding! Can't you see I'm a Titan?!

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.590
These guys are just humans,
yet they're coming to kill me?!

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
These guys... They're the devils of Paradis!

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.940
Behind us! Retreat! Retreat!

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.770
Shit! I can't shake 'em!

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.900
Tsk!

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.790
Shit! That's here, too?

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.750
The Cart Titan!

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.210
Pieck!

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.550
Guess I made it in time.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.840
Like I thought, my machine gun gear
is perfect against their soldiers.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.390
Made getting it worthwhile.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.700
Eren!

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.800
That's him all right... The Beast Titan!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.300
Zeke!

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.440
I'm gonna kill you, Eren Jaeger!

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.780
Let none escape. Kill 'em all.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.120
Don't die on me. Survive!

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.930
"Assault"

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.100
This is...

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.670
Is that...? No way... Kruger?!

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.710
No... Eren Jaeger!

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.670
Damn you!

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.640
Vice Chief Braun!

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.180
Vice Chief!

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.190
Vice Chief, I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.480
Huh?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.660
He's alive, but...

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.120
He's unconscious, but his body should
heal itself with the Power of the Titans.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.040
That is, as long as he
has the will to live, but...

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.220
I'm sick of this... of myself! Just kill me!

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.350
Vice Chief, I'll go get help.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.440
There're more than just enemies out there.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.860
There's me, Gabi, the others...
We're all on your side.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.490
Just hang in there, Vice Chief.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.660
Incoming!

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.540
That jerk!

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.830
Hey, wait!

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.000
I'll slaughter him!

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.340
Protect the war chief's rear!

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.220
Right!

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.340
Above!

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.840
Bad angle!

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.310
Galliard! You're a lifesaver!

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.980
--Thanks!
--Pock!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.400
That was close! Thanks!

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.440
Be careful! I'm not sure where
Ackermann is! He's hiding somewhere!

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.320
Are you serious?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.820
Porco! The War Hammer!

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.460
She's crystallized like Annie.
My teeth are useless against that.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.720
But you're completely worn out now.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.800
If you had anything left,
you'd stab me right through my nape.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.810
You've got no more moves to play.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.690
But I have plenty.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.240
Shit! After all that, the bastard
still has more fight in him?

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.750
But if we get him, the Founder...

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.710
What are you afraid of, Pock?

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:05.500
--Huh?!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.340
--There's no need for us to rush.
--Huh?!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.130
--There's no need for us to rush.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.420
We're the ones controlling the battlefield.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.340
They're being driven into a corner.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.810
They came here in ODM gear,
so their weapons and fuel are limited.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.190
In other words, they're stranded in
enemy territory without support.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:33.650
The Marley army has surrounded
the zone by now, so there's no escape.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:40.790
For starters, Paradis can't compete
against Marley in a real war anyways.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:46.580
But if we take out the Founder right here
and now, they can't do the rumbling!

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.420
Their trump card is right in front of us!

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.380
All the more reason to move cautiously!

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:58.260
Right now, just focus on protecting
the war chief from Ackermann.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.430
That's Pieck for you! Precisely!

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.820
Eren Jaeger... is not my enemy.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.340
Someone else comes first.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.630
Show yourself, Levi.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.050
You're running out of time.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.020
Whoa! War Chief Zeke is something else!

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.230
Grice?!

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.940
Commander Magath!

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.570
Commander! Back in the venue--

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.740
What are you doing?!
Are you okay?! You hurt?!

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.660
I-I'm fine!

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.700
Then get the hell out of here!

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:04.790
Um, Vice Chief Braun is underground
behind the stage and isn't moving!

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.370
What?!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.670
It's my fault. He was... shielding me.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.710
Who did it to him?

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.920
Eren... Jaeger.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.140
Hurry and dock! We need soldiers
at Liberio on the double!

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.150
The whole zone's taking heavy damage! Huh?

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.570
Hey! Get your ship outta here!
Can't you see the fleet?!

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.860
Hey!

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.890
Battle... ships?

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.230
Snap out of it! Get the hell out of here!

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.070
But, Commander Magath...

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.650
It's the port. The only one who can do that--

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.160
The Colossal Titan!

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.160
The Titan they stole from Bertholdt!

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
Those shits!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.380
Guess they didn't barge in here
without a plan after all!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.340
How about this, you damn devils?!

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.760
If you lose the Founder,
your plans mean jack shit!

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.970
The other Ackermann?! Outta my way!

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.900
War Chief! Here comes their attack!

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.790
--Zeke!
--Get down, Gabi!

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.470
Zeke?

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.180
Pieck! They're coming!

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.240
What's wrong?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.490
Hey, Carlo!

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.620
Say something, man! Carlo!

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.710
You'll pay for that!

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.220
This is for last time.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.100
Now! Fire!

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.650
Pieck!

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.820
Guys!

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.000
Pieck!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"New ODM Gear"
"Gear used by the Paradis Island forces which utilizes compressed gas and wire hooks fired from special equipment to allow their soldiers to nearly mimic flight. Though previously unavailable with the island's technology,
the gear includes semi-automatic pistols,
special swords, and some soldiers are even armed to fire shells, enabling superior anti-personnel and anti-Titan combat."

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.230
Are these the sort of sights that you saw?

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.190
Bertholdt...

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.860
No... Please, don't!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.150
Hurry! Finish it off!

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:51.070
Don't shoot! Please, stop!

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.720
It missed?! Was it because of the steam, or...?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.680
Is it my fault I missed?

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.140
Pieck!

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.680
It's the Cart!

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.600
Run... away.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.480
Pieck!

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.650
Hurry!

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.070
Protect Pieck!

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.150
Eat shit, you devils!

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.360
Braun! Give Grice a hand!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.820
Yes, sir!

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.540
Look out! Stay back!

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.370
This way! Hurry!

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.090
Not only the war chief, but Pieck, too?!

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.630
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.300
Damn you!

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.790
So fast! Ymir's Jaw was nothing like this.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.340
So this is the Jaw's power?

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.590
I see.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:33.010
It's awful. Her body can't heal fast enough.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.760
But she's a Titan, so why?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:42.020
Unlike the Armored Titan,
the Cart isn't exactly known for toughness.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.560
Reiner! Where is he?!

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.190
You said Eren Jaeger got him
and he's not moving!

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.440
Can't he fight? Hey!

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:58.030
I don't know! He's still underground
behind the stage, but I...

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.290
I'm thinking we should leave Reiner out of it!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.670
What... are you saying?

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:11.300
What about Udo and Zofia?
What about all the people Eren Jaeger killed?

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.980
Hey, Gabi! Stay away from the window!
The enemy will see you!

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:26.350
Huh?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.310
Huh?

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.820
Commander!

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.480
Huh?

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.790
Wha--?!

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.460
Commander! I've spotted the guide lights!

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.720
Thank goodness. So far,
the operation's going as planned.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.430
We're counting on you, Onyankopon.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.890
Leave it to me, Hange!

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.850
Sneak through the zone, low and slow.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.310
We'll follow the lights and pick everyone up.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.480
We've only got one shot,
so any stragglers are out of luck.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.150
If we're not shot down first, that is.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.990
Talk about a reckless plan.
You get possessed by Erwin or something?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:26.410
I can only hope. If it means
his strength is with me.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.000
Now that it's come to this,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.010
if we can't recover Eren and the others,
there's no future for us.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.390
Jean, it's here.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.260
Yeah. Right on time.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:46.850
You guys think you're escaping on that?
Not happening!

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.690
Shoot!

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.720
Huh?!

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.730
H-Hey!

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.450
You're kidding me!

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.830
Stop!

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.000
Stop it!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.670
Stop it!

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:07.560
Please, stop!

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.530
What happened?

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:31.250
The War Hammer was eaten.
And the Jaw Titan is next.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.590
It can't be... Not Galliard, too.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.020
No...

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.020
--Huh?
--No!

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.230
Reiner!

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.990
Help us!

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.360
--Hey...
--Galliard is about to get eaten!

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.830
--Galliard is about to get eaten!

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.660
Help us!

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.210
Reiner!

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.210
--Shut up.
--Reiner!

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.420
--Reiner!

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.710
--Can you please be quiet?
--Reiner!

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:27.470
--Reiner!
--Reiner!

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.970
--Please! Be quiet!
--Reiner!
--Reiner!

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:32.890
--Help us!

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.560
--Hey! Cut it out, you brats!
--Reiner!
--Help us!

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.480
--Hey! Cut it out!
--Reiner!
--Help us!

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.690
--Help us!

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.190
