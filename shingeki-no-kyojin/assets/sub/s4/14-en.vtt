WEBVTT

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.190
Why did you protect me?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.020
Because. I don't have a reason.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:16.740
I'm the one who killed your comrade.
I'm the one who bludgeoned the guard.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.200
Falco didn't do it. Kill me, not him.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.960
We won't kill you.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.670
But you want to, don't you?

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.790
I don't want to kill you.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.880
Kill this, kill that...
It's all you think about.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.140
Just like someone I know.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.220
Er--

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.980
"Savagery"

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.670
I just wanna talk. Conflict isn't
necessary to solve Eldia's problems.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.430
Hange and the others are fine.
We're just moving them.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.470
Eren, we're the ones who wanted to talk.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.850
What made you go attack
Marley all on your own?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.940
Did Zeke and Yelena really
talk you into joining them?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.950
I am free.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.410
Huh?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.580
The things I do and choices I make
are all decided by my own free will.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.170
So your actions after
meeting Yelena were all you?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.170
Yes.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.300
No, you're being manipulated!

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.640
You wouldn't get kids and innocents
involved, even if they were enemies!

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.440
Plus, I know you care
about us more than anyone!

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.440
Don't you? The reason you
saved me in the cabin...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.530
The reason you gave me this
scarf... is because you're kind--

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.030
I said, "Keep your hands on the table."

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.880
I spoke with Zeke in Liberio,
brother to brother.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.880
Zeke knows more about Titans
than even Marley does.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:09.520
Armin, aren't you still visiting Annie?
Do you think that's your own free will?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.100
Wh-What?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.270
If memories are what shape people,
a part of you is Bertholdt now.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.110
Within you is an enemy
with feelings for another enemy.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.910
Armin... Bertholdt has got into your head.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.040
You're the one manipulated by the enemy.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.370
Eren, what are--?

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.130
You, too, Mikasa.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.380
Huh?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.260
The Ackermanns were intentionally
designed to protect Eldia's King.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.560
Back then, faced with a life-or-death
situation, you heard my order:

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.350
"Fight."

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.770
In that moment, instincts
awoke from within you.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.860
By mistake, you thought I was
the host you had to protect.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.990
No...

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.280
No? No, what?

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.330
It wasn't... a mistake.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.380
It's because it was you, Eren!
I became strong because of you!

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.390
Ackermanns with awakened powers
apparently get sudden headaches.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.690
It happens when their old self resists
being forced to protect their host.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.520
Sound familiar?

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.070
No.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.200
I'm saying...

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.990
No, I...

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.120
Your family was made to forget who
they are and live only to protect.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.410
In other words, slaves.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.040
Enough, Eren!

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.550
Do you know who I hate more than anyone?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.260
Those who aren't free. Just like livestock.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.380
Eren!

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.600
Just seeing you has always pissed me
off so much, and now I finally know why.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.730
I can't stand the sight of a slave
who obeys orders without question.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.900
Ever since I was little...

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.410
...Mikasa, I've hated you.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.490
Eren! How could you say that to--?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.130
Mikasa?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.380
Your entire life has been dictated
by your Ackermann blood.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.590
N-No!

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.930
It's all you really are.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.400
Jaeger!

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.240
I'm all right.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.660
Hey, Armin. You and I have
never fought before, have we?

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.790
Do you know why?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.170
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.920
--Stop...
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.550
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.310
Please, stop.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:47.440
Like I said, if you guys tell us where
Zeke is, there's no need for us to fight.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.780
Come along and behave. Take 'em.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.780
Yes, sir.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.450
The kid who killed Sasha, too.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.620
Is that it? Is that all you came to say?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.830
That you wanted freedom
just so you could hurt Mikasa?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.340
Tell me: Who's the slave
that bows to a bastard again?

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.390
Who you calling a slave? Let's go.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.550
Where?

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.140
To where it all started--Shiganshina.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.730
It's not even funny.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.740
There's another shithead we should have eaten.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.570
What do you mean?

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.700
We'll give the Beast to someone else.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.960
We'll make one of the Jaegerists
into a Titan and have them eat Zeke.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.550
I can't tell if he's manipulating Eren,
but their party's over if they lose Zeke.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.420
Go tell that to Pyxis, got it?

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.470
You're serious, Captain?

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.890
The old man will come around
once I chop Zeke's limbs off.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.480
Enjoying your book?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.110
I am, for one I've read seven times.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.360
You've been eavesdropping more than reading.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.870
Can you blame me when
I've read it this much?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.040
By the way, is there any wine left?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.910
Not a single drop left.
We've been here a month.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.670
Good grief.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.750
You sure know how to torture someone.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.420
Just read your book.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.470
Roger that, boss.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.390
I'm gonna chop him up
no matter what Pyxis says.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.230
There're 30 fully armed soldiers
waiting in the forest above.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.020
Even if he becomes the Beast,
there's no way he escapes.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.610
That bearded shit was our enemy after all.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:10:00.280
And now that we know it,
he doesn't deserve to have limbs.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.540
It took long enough.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.880
Erwin, I'll finally uphold
the promise I made to you.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:16.840
There was meaning in your deaths.
And at long last, I'll prove it.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.480
Huh?

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.320
Hey...

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Spinal Fluid Wine"
"A red wine produced in Marley with Zeke 'Wonderboy' Jaeger's spinal fluid mixed in. After consuming Zeke's spinal fluid and hearing his 'scream,' Subjects of Ymir will turn into Pure Titans who obey his orders. The wine and Titans have proven to be a cheap and effective weapon to conquer enemy nations."

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.810
What was that?

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.220
My body went numb.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.430
--Yeah!
--Me, too!

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:10.230
Huh? I didn't feel a thing.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.900
What's wrong?

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.450
Felt like I got zapped by electricity.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.120
You don't think--?!

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.580
Zeke's done it, hasn't he?

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.080
This is goodbye, Captain.
You care about your subordinates.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:39.130
You're not gonna slice them up
just 'cuz they've grown a bit, are you?

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.480
Wine? Why bring wine on a mission?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.150
Captain! This is the rare Marleyan
stuff only MPs get to drink!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.400
Don't we deserve some?

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.690
We've got tea.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.660
Captain!

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.740
Gimme a break.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.330
Fine. Bring it.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.700
Dammit!

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.960
Zeke's spinal fluid was
in the wine?! Since when?!

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.420
Not a single person froze up! Was it all a lie?!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:25.470
Shit, they're fast! How do they move
like that?! Is that Zeke's doing, too?!

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.440
Varis!

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.780
Are you in there somewhere...

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.700
...you guys?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.840
Farewell. In the end,
we couldn't trust one another.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.720
All the world's might
will soon fall upon this island.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.680
You have no idea what that means.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.650
You guys thought you
had power... time... choices.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:24.700
Not realizing you had none of those,
Levi, was your biggest mistake.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.700
Still, even if I explained my intentions,
you wouldn't understand.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.410
Right, Eren?

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.000
Only you and I do.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.090
Once I escape this forest,
that's where you'll be.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.470
I hope you remember where and when
we're supposed to meet, Eren.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.050
Hmm?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.100
Go!

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.700
What the hell, dammit?! Again?!

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.380
Where are you?!

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.350
Where'd you go, Levi?!

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.390
There you are!

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.400
What happened to your lovely buddies?!

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.030
Don't tell me you killed 'em all!
The poor things!

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.170
Branches?!

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.960
You're looking desperate, hairball!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.510
All you had to do was read your damn book.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.010
What gave you the idea
that you could escape from me?

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:18.430
Did you think I wouldn't kill my comrades
if they turned into Titans?

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:23.270
You don't have a damn clue
how many comrades we've killed!

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:55.260
Hi there, Beardy.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.390
Damn. You stink and you're filthy,
you ugly piece of shit.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.730
Well, no worries,
'cuz I'm not gonna kill you... yet.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.490
As you know, after Premier Zachary was killed,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:18.160
the situation within the walls
has become unstable.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.040
However, this doesn't concern you cadets.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.790
Which is why the 109th Cadet Corps

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:29.210
will be training to defend
Shiganshina from Titan attack!

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.510
You hear me?!

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.060
Y-Yes, sir!

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.560
Why do we care how to cut a Titan's nape?

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.190
Not like they'll attack again.
Our enemies are people now.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:53.950
My old man thinks we should be training
with firearms and form an Eldian army.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.870
The times have changed,
yet Commandant Shadis is stuck in the past.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:05.330
Eldia's only hope is for
the Jaegerists to seize full control.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:07.380
Surma, he can hear you!

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.210
Isn't that what everyone's thinking?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.010
Everyone wants Eren Jaeger to lead Eldia.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.300
We need a leader capable
of making tough decisions.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.940
Wha--?! Hange?!

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.270
Long time no see, Commandant.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.780
Just so you know, this branch
is under new management.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.160
We "Jaegerists" are the ones in charge now.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.120
From now on, you take orders from us.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.830
The Jaegerists...

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.750
Looks like you finally figured it out, Floch.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.710
Unless you point guns at people,

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:56.510
nobody cares what your little gang
of asswipes says, and that's a fact.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.640
Floch!

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.640
I missed.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.600
I thought shooting his foot
might speed things up.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.230
Speed what up?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.730
No, it has nothing to do with you.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:17.570
We have little need for
hard-headed geezers like you.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:23.120
From now on, this is your time, cadets!

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:31.750
We Jaegerists have sworn to give our
hearts to save Eldia from this crisis!

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:38.180
Not for the sake of our obsolete military,
but for the people of this island!

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.300
By obeying the military's archaic mindset,

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.100
you're allowing us to be trampled
by enemies from outside!

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.190
Therefore, I ask you: Who are you?!

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.940
Someone who wants to live
alongside our leader, Eren Jaeger?!

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:01.990
Or someone who will die alongside
Keith Shadis and his antiquated ways?!

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.460
For the sake of Eldia's future,
we give our hearts!

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.210
Good! Now show me your resolve!

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:20.760
Beat Commandant Shadis
till he can't stand anymore!

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.970
Huh?

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.890
He represents the old ways that
must be driven out! Now, do it!

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.730
Those who can't go to prison!

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.230
That's enough, Floch! This is ridiculous!

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.780
Hange!

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.280
No matter how many of these tots
there are, they're no match for me!

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.880
Well done. We're delighted to welcome you all.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.970
Now, could you guide us
to where Zeke's being held?

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.180
Commander Hange.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.480
Hey, let's go.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.540
You awake?

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.000
Hey, wait. Don't move.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.880
There's a wire around your neck
attached to the Thunder Spear fuse.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.220
Squirm too much and you'll be
blown in half or worse.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.810
Bet you wish you were dead right now.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:03.200
Not that I sympathize.
You toyed with the lives of my comrades.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.490
Tell me: Was whimpering while covered
in shit part of your master plan?!

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:17.040
Shut up! Unless I slice you to bits,
you'll turn into a Titan again!

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.390
Where... are... my glasses?

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:37.940
Huh? Who cares?
You won't be needing 'em anymore.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.320
Nice one, Zeke!

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.280
You're getting good at throwing!

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.130
Ever thought about playing baseball?

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:03.260
I can't, Mr. Ksaver...

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.300
I... have a mission.

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:46.690
One remembers long-missed faces
and distant memories.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.910
Likewise, what must be
done to achieve one's mission.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "Sole Salvation."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.490
"Sole Salvation"
