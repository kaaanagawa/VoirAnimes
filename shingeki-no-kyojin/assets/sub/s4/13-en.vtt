WEBVTT

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
It's called a "gas weapon."

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.240
The gas contains some of my spinal fluid.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.610
Breathing just a slight amount
makes Subjects of Ymir freeze up.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240
They can't control their bodies
and lose consciousness.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:48.650
On my command, I send the Power of
the Titans to the coordinate via Paths.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.900
That's why the people
of that village obeyed my orders.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.990
It's not "that" village. It's Ragako.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.410
Don't forget the name of the village
you slaughtered, you bearded shit.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.480
Well, I didn't want to do it.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.460
But if I hadn't, and they found out
I was sided with Eldia,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.650
I couldn't have brought hope to this island.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.430
You know, I told you all this
when I landed on the island.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.810
Why do you keep asking?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.410
You don't have a shred of guilt
in you and it shows.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.820
You may or may not want to save Eldia,
but those lives meant nothing to you.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.330
You can't have been popular.
You think you know everyone's feelings.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.270
I do know.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.040
And I was popular enough.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.380
Well, ain't that great? So?
When will Eren and I begin the test?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.340
It's not up to me. We're waiting for HQ.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.050
They may think they have
time to spare, but they don't.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.100
I'm with you there.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.470
Captain Levi!

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.810
What? Are you serious?

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.990
"Children of the Forest"

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.490
What a big building!

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.540
I've never seen anything like it!

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.750
Me, either!

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.040
It's yer lucky day, kids!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.290
Y'all fixin' to eat?

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.880
Yeah!

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.010
What's wrong, Mia? Got the jitters?

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.380
Um, no...

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.390
You're so nervous, Mia!

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.050
I know! What a total bumpkin!

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.600
N-No!

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.560
Kaya! Does a Marleyan 
captive really work here?

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.690
It's true, so get a grip.
Soldiers use this place, too.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.300
It'll be good to know another Marleyan.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.070
Mr. Braus! Thank you for coming!

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.690
Thanks a bunch for the invite!

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.330
Oh, my. You sure brought a crowd.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.590
Since it's on the house,
I brought the whole gang. Sorry.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.550
It's fine. Welcome, everyone. 
This way, please.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.550
I'm starving, dad!

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.020
--You and me both!
--We skipped breakfast for this!

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.180
That's Nicolo, the Marleyan
who invited Mr. Braus.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.300
See if he can help you.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.080
Mr. Braus isn't a soldier,
so why was he invited?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.040
His daughter was the girl
soldier who saved me.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.950
Nicolo was at her grave and wanted
to treat him to the food she loved.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.460
But, personally, I thought they were in love.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.870
Ben?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.130
What's wrong? Tummy ache?

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.220
Uh, no!

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.220
Delicious! I've never had anything this good!

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.360
Just wait till you've had the main dish!

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.240
Nicolo, you've got guests.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.550
Huh?! Who is it now?!

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.170
The Scouts.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.790
You guys? What, is it urgent?
My hands are full with some customers.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.130
Uh, you can get back to work if you want.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.050
It's just, we'd like to 
talk once you're done.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.180
Talk? About what?

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.970
Oh, you know. Like any concerns you have.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.390
They're investigating our detainment.
We're hoping you can help.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.400
Yeah, all right.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.610
You can wait here.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.400
Oh? What a fancy room.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.980
I bet it's reserved for MPs.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.540
Huh? Is this the wine all the
soldiers are gossiping about?!

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.350
They say only higher ranks can get it!

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.420
Yeah? Aren't we high rank in the Scouts?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.130
Yup! We deserve a bit
of fun, too! A sip or two--

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.050
Don't touch that!

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.100
Ch-Chill out, Nicolo.
We're just screwing around.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.010
No need to overreact.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.850
This good stuff would be wasted on Eldians!

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.330
Nicolo, you're still saying stuff like that?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.860
The booze don't give a damn what race we are!

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:14.810
Don't touch me, Eldian. Just because
I've been nice doesn't make us pals.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.870
Have you forgotten what 
you are? You're just a--

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.760
A filthy captive, huh?
That makes us even, Eldian.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.550
What's his problem?

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.140
Dammit! Hell if I know.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.560
Go.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.770
Argh! My stomach hurts!

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.400
You okay, Ben?

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.270
Eat something bad?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.190
I think I need to use the restroom!

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.030
I think I better go help my brother!

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.460
Good luck.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.250
Hmm? The restroom is the other way.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.920
That's not why we're here, Nicolo.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.630
We came from Marley. 
We're Warrior candidates.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:13.630
What?!

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.640
We think there will be a huge
offensive against the island soon.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.650
Until then, hang in there! And let any
of your Marleyan comrades know!

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.280
H-Hold up! What are Warrior
candidates doing here?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.950
The island devils raided Liberio.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.780
We got aboard their airship
as it retreated and rode it here.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.280
Did you... kill anyone?

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.210
A female... soldier?

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.800
Yes, I did!

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.300
--I've only killed a few, but our real
revenge has yet to begin!

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.760
--Gabi, wait! Hey!
--I've only killed a few, but our real
revenge has yet to begin!

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.470
--We won't let those spineless
devils get away with...

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.090
--Gabi, stop!
--We won't let those spineless
devils get away with...

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.690
--What?!
--So it was you...

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.730
...who killed her?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.900
You're the one who killed Sasha?!

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.250
Falco?!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.750
Hey, Falco!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.750
Are you okay, Falco?!

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:35.010
--Falco! Falco! Get up! Wake up!
Hey! Say something, Falco!

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.710
--Shit!
--Falco! Falco! Get up! Wake up!
Hey! Say something, Falco!

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.940
Nicolo! What'd ya do to Ben and Mia?!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.190
She's the one who killed Sasha.
She took your daughter's life.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.200
Though she's just a kid,
she's a trained Marleyan soldier.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.540
She got aboard the airship leaving
Marley and shot your daughter.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.460
She shot Sasha.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.620
Daughter?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.840
Mr. Braus, here.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.720
If you can't kill her, I will.
Is that all right?

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.730
Wh-What the--?! Come here, guys!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.730
Huh? What is it?

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.990
The kid who shot Sasha!

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.240
What's going on, Nicolo?
I heard she's on the run!

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.240
What do you think you're doing?! Hey!

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.500
Don't move! Get back!
I'm avenging Sasha! Stay put!

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.750
Stop...

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.750
Not Falco!

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.260
What is this brat to you?!
He took the hit for you!

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.760
Do you care about him?!
I cared about someone, too!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.520
An Eldian! Spawn of the devil!

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.500
One who loved my cooking
more than anyone!

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.620
She saved me from this shitty-ass war!

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:20.030
She taught me that I like
making people happy with food!

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.030
Her name was Sasha Braus!
She's the girl you stole from me!

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:33.250
People I cared about were killed, too!
They were shot by your Sasha Braus!

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.670
That's why I got revenge!
She killed people first!

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.800
Who gives a damn who killed first?!

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.430
Open your eyes! You're a Marleyan soldier!

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.800
That devil woman bewitched you!
Don't lose to the devils!

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.910
Nicolo, hand me the knife.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.680
Come on.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.970
Don't do it, Mr. Braus.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.270
Please put down the knife.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.970
Sasha was a hunter.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.610
What?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.640
Even as a wee girl, she shot
varmints in the forest for us to eat.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.810
That was just our way of livin'.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:47.530
But I knew there'd come a day we'd
have to give up that style of life,

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.490
so I sent Sasha away from the forest.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.660
She went into the world,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:13:00.000
became a soldier, shot people
far yonder, and got herself shot.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.760
In the end, though she left our forest,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:10.010
the world is a great, big forest where
everyone's fightin' for their life.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:16.020
I reckon Sasha died 'cuz she
wandered in the forest too long.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.560
We've gotta keep the
younguns out of the forest.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.580
Otherwise, ain't nothin' gonna
stop it from happenin' again.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:34.130
That's why it's up to us adults
to shoulder the sins of the past.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.670
Nicolo, let Ben go.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.010
Good, Lisa. Slowly, now.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:49.680
Right.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.810
Are you hurt?

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.930
Mia... You okay?

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.560
Do you really...

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.310
...not hate me?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.200
--Kaya...
--How dare you kill her!

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.910
--Kaya, stop!
--How dare you kill her!

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.830
You murderer! I thought you were a friend!

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.920
Let's move you! C'mon!

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.130
Now the food's gone cold.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.440
Hange, try to rinse out that kid's mouth.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.940
Some wine got in it.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.700
Huh?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.200
Though... it's probably too late.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.270
What's in... the wine?

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.570
I think... Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Marleyan Cuisine"
"The regional food of Marley which consists largely of fish, shrimp, and other various shellfish. Served deep-fried, steamed, marinated,
and in stews with aromatic vegetables,
the many styles of Marleyan cuisine are enjoyed by people worldwide. The famous red wine of Southern Marley is often used as a secret ingredient in their cuisine, but is paired with meals as well."

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.880
Zachary was killed?

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:16.480
Yes. The Jaegerists effectively
control everything in the walls.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:24.150
We think it's all part of some plan Zeke
put together using Yelena and Eren.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:25.730
And?

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.570
Soon, the Jaegerists may bring Eren to
see Zeke like they've been demanding.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.740
And Pyxis? Is he letting this happen?

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.120
As you know, the commander
can be quite stubborn.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.130
He's gonna make sure Eren
gets eaten... by our own hands.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.630
That's right.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.560
I've saved Eren, over and over--
each time, more comrades dying.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.710
All because I believed
he was the hope of humanity.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:06.270
And look--this is where my beliefs got me.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:12.840
It's like some awful joke.
What the hell was the hope that we saw?

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.290
All that struggle for a farce like this?

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.290
Such bullshit. It's not even funny.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.290
There's another shithead
we should have eaten.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.840
What do you mean?!
Zeke's spinal fluid is in the wine?!

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.350
I don't have proof, but...

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.840
They packed the first scout fleet
to the brim with it--

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.920
well more than any scouting mission needed.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.240
--Again.
--And...

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:53.780
...around the time I secured
my job here as a chef,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.160
--I was told to serve it
to high-ranking officers.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.620
--One more time.
--I was told to serve it
to high-ranking officers.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.370
By who?!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.260
Yelena.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.790
As far as I know, she's 
the only one in on it.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.980
Can't speak for the other volunteers.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.380
Th-This is the first time 
I've heard about it!

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:21.520
It doesn't make sense! Don't Eldians
freeze up if they drink his spinal fluid?

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.670
According to Zeke. Nobody witnessed it,
so there's no way to confirm it.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.530
But... the effectiveness of his
little lie has been enormous.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:40.530
Because nobody has frozen up,
no one is even aware they drank it.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:45.580
Yeah, but... You don't know for sure, right?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.550
Yeah, I can't prove it.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.800
But Marleyans know how Zeke's
spinal fluid has been used in the past.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:18:00.510
About ten years ago,
we conquered a capital in just one night.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.430
Hundreds of Titans sprung up in the city.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.980
Unless that's what she's plotting,

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:16.320
I don't know why she wants it served
to your military's top officers.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.490
So earlier, you grabbed the wine
away 'cuz you were protecting us?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.330
Who knows? I don't know what I'm doing.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.190
I came here to save the world
from island devils.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.580
Now that I've opened my mouth,
I'm sure my days are numbered.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.840
But, Mr. Braus...

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.370
I don't think I can be like you,
but if this can serve as atonement...

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.110
Killing a child? What's wrong with me?

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.040
Nicolo...

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.810
Why did you protect me?

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.870
Because. I don't have a reason.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:14.280
I'm the one who killed your comrade.
I'm the one who bludgeoned the guard.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.800
Falco didn't do it. Kill me, not him.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.640
We won't kill you.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.640
But you want to, don't you?

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.260
I don't want to kill you.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.400
Kill this, kill that...
It's all you think about.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.650
Just like someone I know.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.030
Er--

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.910
What's wrong?

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.660
Commander Hange.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.850
Floch!

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.660
I'm glad you're here.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.040
I imagine you know where Zeke's at.
We'll have you take us there.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.670
Wait. We have no intention of fighting you.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.180
We rejected your proposal.
We won't negotiate with the military.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.680
And why is that?

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.060
It's Eren's decision.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.690
Pyxis would never leave the fate
of the island in our hands.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.320
I'm sure he's frantically devising a plan

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.660
to take the Founder from Eren
while we're on the move.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.090
You're imagining things.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:30.700
Or is that what your comrades
in the Garrison Regiment said?

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.320
Does it look like I'm one of your
lackeys that'll answer you?

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:42.590
I suggest you get moving
before I prove to you that I'm not.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.350
Shit. How'd they know we were here?

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.850
Greiz? Did Yelena put you up to this?

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:58.230
Nicolo, you're too obsessed with Eldians.
I knew this day would eventually come.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.360
I was right not to tell 
you how to reach them.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.270
Floch, listen!

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:08.050
We don't have time
to be fighting among ourselves!

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.120
Wine with Zeke's spinal fluid
was spread through the military!

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.000
Zeke fooled us all with this plan of his!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.690
So what? It'll just make
the idiot MPs into bigger idiots.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.320
Can we go?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.580
I never said the MPs drank it!

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.870
No way! You guys knew about the wine?!

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.330
Use your inside voice, please.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.700
We're going ahead.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.510
Okay.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.200
That voice... Floch must've come.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.700
Yeah.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.500
I wanted... to talk with you guys.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.340
The Jaegerists capture Hange and the others.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:51.170
Staring intensely at Armin and Mikasa,
Eren says that he wants to talk.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.650
Next episode: "Savagery."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.490
"Savagery"
