00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
"Two Brothers"

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.770
Galliard!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.620
Founding Titan hit! It stopped moving!

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.920
Good! Put another in the Beast!

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.250
Don't let 'em shoot!

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.920
Would you piss off already?!

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
The Cart Titan! We've gotta
deal with her first!

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.180
Armin!

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.770
They're in the houses!

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.690
Fall back! This way's no good!

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.950
We've gotta take out these soldiers.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.030
Yeah.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.030
Wrap around!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.370
Let's get behind 'em!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.880
He's got the right idea.
We can't fight them head-on.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.460
Let's sneak behind 'em.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.370
I fell... to the ground.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.500
Was I... shot?

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.840
Eren...

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.470
Get up, Porco!

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.390
Find the strength, Galliard!

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.940
I'm sorry. Reiner, I'm sorry.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.820
You were never meant
to be chosen as a Warrior.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.200
I talked you up and criticized
my brother to influence their decision.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.580
I... just wanted to protect my brother.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.800
General Magath!

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.340
Zeke... is still alive?!

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.770
It's time to summon the Titans.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.850
Wait!

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.940
Wait!

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:11.040
Falco got some spinal fluid in his mouth!
Please don't scream, Zeke!

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.620
What... was that?

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.170
I'm inheriting the Beast to keep my
family from being sent to paradise!

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.300
--Let go, Colt! Colt!
--To be honest,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.050
I rarely understood you,
even before you betrayed us!

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.390
But I don't think you're someone
who'd drag kids into this!

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.020
I'm not saying you should just
lie down and die!

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.400
But wait till Falco's
out of range of your scream!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.950
After that, slaughter away! Kill as many
Eldians and Marleyans as you want!

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.830
Just don't drag my brother into this!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.240
Falco! Hop on!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.160
Stay back, Gabi!

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.210
Colt...

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.880
Only too well do I understand
the feelings for one's brother.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.520
Zeke...

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.560
So...

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.900
It's a shame.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.240
--Get away from me, Colt!
--It's okay, Falco!

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.660
I'm here for you!

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.490
What the--?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.490
The enemy... turned into Titans?

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.410
Quick! The Anti-Titan cannons!

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.940
Get him, Falco.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.410
Colt...?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.760
Falco...?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.760
I can't fight both of 'em.
Eren will get away.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.520
The one to end Falco...

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.100
...is... me?

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.120
Eren!

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.160
Falco! My nape!

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.810
He's a goner this time;
I'm sure of it. Crisis averted.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.350
Shit, guys! Is anyone alive?!

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.850
That leaves the Founding Titan.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:12.780
We've got no need for your head--
just your spinal fluid!

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.450
We were too slow.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.530
Bring him down!

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.500
It's over! It's over for you guys!

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.760
It's over...?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:44.020
Eren can't use the Founding Titan's
power now. We fulfilled our duty.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.110
I can just let it happen now, right?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.490
Once I undo the hardening
on my nape, I'm done...

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.660
The one who will inherit the Armor...

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.670
...is Falco.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:28.560
I'm all out of power to heal my body.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.110
But I ain't dying for nothing.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.950
I saw my brother's memories.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:47.500
He fooled the military to make your
lousy ass a Warrior--to protect me.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.540
Wait... No!

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.290
Porco!

00:10:54.290 --> 00:11:01.220
There's no denying it now.
I was always better than you.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.020
Huh?

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.730
Galliard...?

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.370
Could he be...?!

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.960
Glad you noticed, Eren.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.130
Imitating Pieck and pretending
to be dead worked perfectly.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.210
We're so close!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.940
Come on, Eren!

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Scream"
"Eldians who have ingested Zeke Jaeger's spinal fluid transform into Pure Titans from his 'scream.' Losing their own will, these Titans obey Zeke regardless of who they are or their lives before."

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.900
First of all, thanks for coming
here to talk with me.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.360
My stance is exactly what
Yelena told you.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.280
Do you support the
Eldian euthanization plan?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.620
Four years ago, some of Dad's
memories opened up to me--

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.750
memories of when he slaughtered
the wall's royal family.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:05.010
He crushed their little kids
and smeared them like bugs.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.430
I felt it, too.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.520
If those kids lived, the royal family
would retake the Founding Titan.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:19.860
Bound by the vow renouncing war,
humanity in the walls would be doomed.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.360
Those kids dying is what let us live.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:30.030
I see. So you believe
that Father was right?

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.580
No, he was wrong.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.960
And I, the son that he raised,
was wrong, too.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.210
If Eldians hadn't been born, this city--

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.090
these people wouldn't have to die
in this plan of ours.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:53.390
There's no greater salvation
than never being born in this world.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:14:00.440
I'll do it. I'll put an end
to 2,000 years of Titan domination.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.610
Until then, I keep moving forward.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.820
Right, Brother?

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:14.330
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Let's do it.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:21.630
I wish I could shake your hand, but it's
best that we don't make contact just yet.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.300
So instead, take this.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:30.430
Eren, we're gonna save everyone.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.730
I dropped it.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.360
Hospital life must've made me sluggish.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.950
This is...?

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:17.240
The Coordinate where all Paths
converge, I believe.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.120
Those who use the Founding Titan's
power must come here.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.920
Those with royal blood, that is.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.590
Brother...

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.010
The wait's been exhausting, Eren.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:38.180
It feels like I've been waiting years
for you to recover and wake up.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.480
Years... have passed?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.020
I'm not sure. Here, everything
happens in an instant.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.280
Your head was blown off by Gabi,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.240
but you made contact with me
before you passed on.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:03.410
We succeeded. We obtained
the power of the Founding Titan.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.630
Someone's here.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:15.010
Don't worry, that's... the Founder Ymir.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.300
The Founder Ymir? How do you know?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:25.440
Who else but the Founder Ymir would be
wandering around in a place like this?

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:33.240
At one time, she rebuilt my body with
this earth and brought me back to life.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.740
I imagine this is where
she makes Titans...

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:45.250
Expending untold years whenever
we seek the Power of the Titans.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.210
All alone here... Forever...

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.430
Eren, command the Founder Ymir.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.510
The time has come to fulfill our dream.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.020
Those chains...

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:14.740
Finally noticed them, have you?
I appreciate your concern.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:21.160
They're to restrict my freedom.
It's the vow renouncing war.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.620
As I thought, only you
can move freely here.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.420
Only you can command
the Founder Ymir...

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:40.430
To fulfill my, Mr. Ksaver's, and your
dream. Please, save the world.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.600
Eren...

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:55.030
Tell her to make Eldians unable
to bear children till the end of time.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.410
Crushing the military with
the rumbling can come later.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:05.160
Euthanize every last Eldian...

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.580
Eren...?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.540
There's no way in hell I'd go along
with such a messed up plan.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:18.760
Sorry, Brother. I was only playing
along in order to get here.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:32.480
As long as Eldians exist,
this hell will never end!

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.030
If you don't go through with it,
the bloodshed will never stop!

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:43.370
All we've been through
will just cycle for eternity!

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:47.750
Why, Eren?! Answer me!

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.210
Because I was born in this world.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:57.710
Founder Ymir, lend me your power.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:12.190
I thought as much, Eren.
I hoped, if anyone, you would understand.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.820
Is this the result of Father's
brainwashing again?!

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:27.620
What... does this mean?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:33.460
In the time it took for you
to wake up, I learned many things.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:40.300
The Founder can make anything,
even these earthen chains.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.430
As long as I, with royal blood, wills it.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.930
Unlike the Kings of the walls,

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.770
I'm here without being tainted
by the First King's ideals.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.940
And in the mind-numbing time
I spent with the Founder,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.820
I managed to nullify
the vow renouncing war.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:07.030
Though possessing tremendous power,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.700
the Founder is a slave
with no will of her own.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:17.880
She believes those with royal blood
are her masters and obeys them.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.670
I've obtained the Founder's power.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.260
Impossible.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:28.760
You were no more than the key, Eren.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.480
I'm glad I waited to hear
your true feelings.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.230
It's not your fault.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:45.110
You and I are tragic victims
born by that vile father.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.950
But I had another father who saved me.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.040
You need somebody to save you, too.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:22:00.170
I will never abandon you.
I'll fix you with the Founder's power!

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.840
Stop. It's pointless.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.300
When I save the world, it'll be with you!

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.480
Although rejected, the older brother
doesn't abandon the younger.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.110
In the place where they end up,
the brothers learn the truth.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "Memories of the Future."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.490
"Memories of the Future"
