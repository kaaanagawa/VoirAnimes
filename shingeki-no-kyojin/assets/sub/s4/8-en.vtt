00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.380
Reiner!

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.500
Eren!

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.420
I think the fight's over. We're out of strength.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.300
At this point, I can't exactly kill Reiner.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.810
In that case, let's go back home.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.810
See you later, Reiner.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.960
Protect the airship from below!
Use every last shot you've got!

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.630
They're retreating... Does this mean we're safe?

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.090
They're running.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.890
Gabi!

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.190
Eren Jaeger!

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.600
Gabi!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.320
You won't get away! I'm gonna kill you!

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.990
"Assassin's Bullet"

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.210
Damn, you're a filthy sight.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.170
You fall in a pile of shit?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.500
Eren...

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.550
Captain...

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.280
This brings back memories, Eren.
You have such a kickable face.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.780
After you're all tied up, we'll have a chat.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.160
That's fine, but I explained
everything in the letters.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.870
Did you not understand it?

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.590
That face... It reminds me of the
rotten shits who lived underground.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.300
Never thought I'd see it on you.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.680
Cheer up. Everything happened like you wanted.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.740
Stop 'em! Kill every last one you can!

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.330
Everybody, in! They've got nothing
to take down an airship!

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.290
Jean!

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.460
You go! I'll hold the rear!

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.130
It's all you, Commander Lobov!

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.880
I told you, I'm a recruit!

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.220
Nobody needs the Garrison anymore!

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.810
Especially not some overpaid geezer!

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.730
Jean!

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.350
Grab on!

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:03.820
Who's left?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.320
Still waiting on Lima Squad.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.030
As far as we know, there're six casualties.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.490
I see... Shit!

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.410
That's nothing compared to the damage we did!

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.290
It's a huge victory!

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.040
The New Eldian Empire's
first battle ends in victory!

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.880
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.760
Tonight, we celebrate in honor
of our six fallen heroes!

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.560
First battle, huh?
How many more till the fighting ends?

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.690
Just how many have to die?

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.530
Anyways, I'm just glad we survived again.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:57.250
It's not very fair to the others,
but you guys are special...

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.960
...to me.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.970
That hurts, idiot. Don't hug us
wearing hard-ass gear.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.800
Excuse me, Jean?! You're the idiot for
always fussing over your tiny-ass beard!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.640
Huh?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.730
That's right! Why grow a beard
if you can't eat it?

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:20.640
Huh?!

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.150
Say, are we eating soon?

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.320
Not till we reach the island.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.860
What a useless leader you are.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.360
Gabi!

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.490
Gabi, wait!

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.970
C'mon, that's enough.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.180
They're flying away.
Running after them is pointless.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.430
Even you know that.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.060
Zofia...

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:11.360
Zofia's body was crushed under debris.
I was sitting right next to her.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.950
Udo tried to help her,
but he got trampled by the stampede.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.080
Stepped on, over and over,
until his head split open.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.380
And the two gate guards... They stopped me.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.630
I was trying to run back to the plaza.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.510
I'm an Eldian, but they told me to
turn back because it's dangerous.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.310
Then they were shot by a girl
on the roof and died.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:50.280
Being an Eldian born in the zone,
people spit at me when I go outside.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.570
I've had a lot of miserable memories,
but that's why I try so hard.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.240
To show the world that Eldians
are good people!

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.290
So that someday, we could be proud
of our Eldian armbands!

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:12.380
I worked hard believing it could happen!
But they crushed everything!

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:19.050
This internment zone is my home!
It's where the people I care about live!

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.770
Isn't trampling on it unforgivable?!

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.360
And yet, you're telling me
not to run after them?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.240
When Zeke was killed before our eyes
and we could do nothing?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.950
Not knowing why any of this happened?!

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:45.870
Why, Reiner? Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.340
They were trampled on.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.750
Huh?

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:57.260
The enemy was attacked by Marley
Warriors and lots of people died.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.470
This is revenge.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:05.930
Did you... see it happen?

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.650
No, I didn't.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.980
Neither did I.

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:29.290
Besides, they're all just island devils
who threaten world peace.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:35.670
You should know that! They're cruel
devils who've always deserved to die.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.050
They're nothing like us.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.180
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.980
Across the sea, within the walls...
It's the same.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.450
Lima Squad? That means everyone's aboard.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.450
Tell the bridge we're good to ascend!

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.120
Roger!

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.830
Huh?

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.250
A kid?!

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.060
It hit!

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.610
It's still attached...

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.160
Gabi!

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.280
What do you think you're doing?!

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.040
This trigger... If I pull it...

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.340
Gabi... Don't tell me you're
thinking of boarding it!

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.970
I'm gonna kill those island devils!

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.260
You'll just end up dead, idiot!

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.680
Tell my mom and dad.
Let Reiner and the others know:

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.350
That I fought till the end.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:19.150
Even if we don't win today,
you guys will carry on my will.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:22.200
Falco! Gabi!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.370
What the hell are you guys doing?!

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.030
My brother...

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.160
Goodbye, Falco.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.290
You were one of the good ones.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:41.840
You have to rescue Gabi
from the dark future that awaits us.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:47.800
Falco!

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.480
Falco?!

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.480
Why?!

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.730
The one who should inherit
the Armored Titan... is me!

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.530
Huh?!

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.200
Did you hear a sound just now?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.040
Hey! Quiet down!

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.040
Make some noise! Victory!

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.540
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.830
Hey!

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.090
Isn't Lobov still out there?

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.720
No, I think he came aboard.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.190
Sasha!

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.030
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Marley Military's Official Rifle"
"The military's official bolt-action rifle fires five shots and can be equipped with the standard-issue knife as a bayonet. They are used regularly by Marley's Warrior unit, army, and navy."

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:07.590
You bastard!

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.680
Sasha! Hey!

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.020
Hang in there! Hey!

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.860
You're so... damn loud...

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.360
Are we... eating soon?

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.360
Bandages, now!
We've gotta stop the bleeding!

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.240
Right!

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.040
Sasha! Make it to the island!

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.410
Meat...

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.060
Jean, they climbed aboard
using Lobov's ODM gear.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.400
I'll toss 'em outside. All right?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:14.370
If we toss kids out of an airship,
will the killing ever end?

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.010
What happened to Braun and Grice?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.340
They ran off without warning
and never came back.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.180
Pieck...

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:47.530
Commander, I remember...

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:54.370
There was a Marley soldier who
led Galliard and me into a trap.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.750
I remember seeing that
same soldier three years ago.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:10.880
They were on the first scout fleet sent
to Paradis after Reiner came back.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.510
The missing scout ships?

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.720
Yes. I'm sure of it.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.770
They looked so awful with a beard.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.310
Hey, you gonna wear that forever?

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:30.070
Huh? I thought it was well-received.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.160
They're still celebrating?

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.000
Don't touch me, you devils!
We haven't lost yet!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.250
The rest of our comrades will carry
on the will of War Chief Zeke!

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.050
Gabi, stop!

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.710
What do we do with 'em, Jean?

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.050
Us true Eldians are gonna
haunt you till you die!

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.560
Pass that on to your
ringleader after I'm dead!

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.480
I'll take you to him.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.560
You can tell him exactly what you told me.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.540
How'd you identify the soldier?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:28.500
Well, it's someone I had
a particular interest in.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.470
Because... she's a devout follower of Zeke.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.100
Gabi... Falco...? Why are you here?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.220
Why? Why are you?

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.810
You're alive?! Why did you
let them capture you?!

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.110
Who are these kids?

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.860
They killed Lobov and used
his gear to come aboard.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.280
Sasha was shot by this one here.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.040
I don't think she's gonna make it.

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.800
It's all you, Onyankopon.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.760
You got it, Hange!

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.850
Well? Did everything play out
as you hoped, Zeke Jaeger?

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.690
Huh?

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:33.520
For the most part,
but there were a few miscalculations.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.900
Zeke...?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.780
Huh? Who are these kids?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.200
Miscalculations.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.200
Yelena! What the hell happened
to trapping the Cart and Jaw?!

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.870
People died because of you!

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:56.300
I'm sorry. I assure you they fell
down the hole, but it's still my fault.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:02.720
And to cover for that slip-up, the Beast
chucked more rocks at us than planned.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.930
That was some clever improv for a clown
like you. Wouldn't you say, hairball?

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:15.150
Don't glare at me like that, Levi.
What if I piss my pants?

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:22.280
And you're quite the actor yourself,
considering you want to kill me so bad.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:28.500
I'm the kind of person
who saves the best bite for last.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.830
I like to savor the taste.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:38.460
We killed the Marley brass
and destroyed their port and fleet.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.300
That should buy us some time.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:46.390
Until the whole world launches
a joint attack on Paradis?

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:52.020
Every time you're caught by the enemy,
we sacrifice lives to get you back.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.940
No matter how many it takes.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.990
And yet knowing that, you went
so far as to make yourself a hostage.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.280
Just like you hoped,
we didn't have much choice.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.580
You put your trust in us
and we lost our trust in you.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:17.500
But now we have the Founding Titan
and a Titan with royal blood.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:24.390
The cost of those sacrifices
will be paid through Eldia's freedom.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.770
Sasha...

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.900
...is dead.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.880
Conny.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.930
Did Sasha... have any last words?

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.930
She said... "Meat."

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.870
I brought some meat from
the officers' storehouse!

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.080
It'll be fine!

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.080
We can just raise more cattle and sheep
once we retake our land!

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:57.100
Eren... Sasha only died because you
dragged the Scouts into this.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:44.960
Could they have taken some other path?

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:52.760
Unable to change the past, they must
continue down the one before them.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.970
Next episode: "Brave Volunteers."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.970
