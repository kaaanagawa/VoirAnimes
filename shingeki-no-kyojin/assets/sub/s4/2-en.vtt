WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.270
Four years we wasted squabbling
over a peninsula's sovereignty.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.570
And our two main battle Titans were
nearly shredded by the enemy fleet.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.490
"Human ingenuity surpasses
and shatters Marley's Armor at last."

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.960
The press from other nations
is commending the Mid-East Forces.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.000
Does this sound like a victory
for Marley to you?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.050
Magath, do you care to comment?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.630
General, I'm afraid the time has come.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.050
That is, humanity has eclipsed
the Power of the Titans.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.350
While we've been relying heavily
on Titans and colonial expansion,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.940
other nations have been developing
weapons to counter us.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.570
As a result, our strategy has
come back to bite us on the ass.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.820
For the time being, our Titans remain
unrivaled when it comes to land battles.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.540
However, if aircraft keep advancing at
this rate, bombs will soon fall like rain.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.710
All while Titans, the devils of the earth,
can do nothing but look up and watch.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.600
Do we not have any Titans with wings?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.850
General, I'm trying to say
that the era of Titans--

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.430
I know.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.480
In the near future,
we will lose our initiative in war.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.400
No, perhaps we already have.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.370
Though once the heroes who crushed
the Eldian devils, look at what we've become.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.910
If I may, General?

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.870
Requesting permission to give counsel.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.250
Zeke, the wonderboy. Go ahead.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.260
We should resume the Paradis Island Operation
and recover the Founding Titan.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.220
As Commander Magath was saying,
Marley needs to develop better weapons.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.190
However, the world will not stand by and wait.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.150
Our military needs time
to completely restructure.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.190
But for that, the newspapers
of the world must read this:

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.570
"Marley Occupies Paradis
and Wields the Power of All Titans."

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.370
You have one year left
in your term, correct?

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.960
Yes, and I'm concerned that Colt can't
inherit the full power of the Beast Titan.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.300
I see.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.180
In your last year, you wish to redeem
yourself for your defeat four years ago?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.350
That is correct.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.440
The sick exploits of Grisha Jaeger
should be brought to an end

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.440
by none other than me, his former son.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.990
"Midnight Train"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.750
Sorry I bashed you to further my agenda, Colt.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.760
Don't be. You were amazing.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.680
To think, an Eldian being heard by the general!

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.430
There hasn't been a Beast
like you in its history.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.390
Sometimes it reminds me
of the Founding Titan.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.730
Why are you so special?
It's not like you have any royal blood.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.450
Who knows? Guess I'll be dead
before we figure it out.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.740
Oh... But when you inherit my memories,
you'll find out my big secret.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.000
Secret? What is it?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.790
The special way I wipe my ass.
Hope you don't tell anyone.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.790
Too late. I want a report.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.050
--Commander!
--Commander!

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.510
Everything down to the hairs on your ass.
Do you think Eldians get privacy?

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.470
No, sir!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.850
You can conquer Paradis in a year?

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.270
It's more like I only have
one year left to try.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.110
These past three years, every scout ship
we've sent to Paradis hasn't returned.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.240
Zeke, what do you think of that?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.120
Considering 32 ships were sunk, I can't
imagine a single Titan was responsible.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.000
At least two Titans, including Eren Jaeger,
must have blocked their escape.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.300
I agree. If we attack the island,
our ships will need support.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.810
Yes. But it's more than their Titans
that pose a threat.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.400
Wai--

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.280
It seemed like you were having a
good dream, so I didn't wake you.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.450
I still haven't thanked you
for back then. Galliard...

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.120
Thank you.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.290
Don't thank me.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.920
If I inherited the Armored Titan nine
years ago, this wouldn't have happened.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.180
My brother wouldn't have protected you
and been eaten by a Titan, either.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.180
You saw Marcel's memories?

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.430
No, but I learned enough from
that girl before me, Ymir.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.770
What an impressive name
for such a pitiful woman.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.190
Isn't it thanks to her that we
got my brother's Jaw back?

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.780
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.160
What the hell were you doing on that island?

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.080
Getting saved by someone new every day?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.950
Yeah.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.960
I saw how you acted through her memories.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.050
What's with that?
Pretending to be a reliable guy, huh?

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.590
I'd say you were imitating my brother!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.260
Pock, let's not pick on people
who just took cannons to the face.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.060
Quit calling me that, Pieck.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.260
You all right?

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.390
It's been two months
since I've been a human.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.980
I kinda forgot the whole bipedal thing.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.860
By the way, Reiner...
You oughta see Gabi and the others.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.110
They're worried about you.

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.900
Think I will.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.240
I'm pooped.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.830
Feels like ages since I've seen you.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.960
Really? Even though we're
always fighting together?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.250
Well, we might not have to for a while.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.170
Let's hope so.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.510
--This way.
--Sure.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.100
Hey, if Titans lose their usefulness in battle,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.730
what will happen to the
Warrior unit and us Eldians?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:36.070
--A guy that lives near me said
the sea is so salty 'cuz he pisses in it.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.150
--Mr. Braun will be fine.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.740
--I know.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.070
--Huh? That's...

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.660
They're probably enemy soldiers
that survived the Pure Titan attack.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.380
Once they get home, they'll talk about
how inhumane Titan warfare is!

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.300
It'll just make things
even worse for us Eldians!

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.340
"People of the world!
Let us kill the Subjects of Ymir!"

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.600
--Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.180
--Cut it out, Udo.
--Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.560
Don't beat up the city.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.440
Reiner!

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.230
You're okay to walk?!

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.320
Yeah. Are you guys all right?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.110
--Gabi.
--Yup!

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.320
--Udo.
--I guess.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.530
--Zofia.
--Same old.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.330
Falco.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.120
Hello.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.080
Hey! They said we're going back to Liberio!

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.920
Let's walk around till then!

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.880
Hey!

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.090
We never get chances like this!

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.460
Shouldn't Mr. Braun be resting?

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.640
I'm all right. Don't worry.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.720
<i>You</i> go home and rest!

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.560
I'm coming, too!

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.310
Hold up, Gabi. Commander Magath
said that's not a place kids--

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.560
But I just saw him walking that way.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.030
You worrywart.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.110
Wait!

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.280
Huh?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.710
You kids are too young for that store.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.920
Aww!

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.800
Did you guys witness the bravery
of our Eldian goddess?!

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.680
Gabi took on the armored train
in place of 800 Eldian soldiers!

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.100
Man, Colt! You stink of booze!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.400
Why'd you do it, you big idiot?!

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.280
Comrades! Do you have any idea
why this idiot risked her life?!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:43.080
Well, I do! She did it to save
all your asses in the Eldian unit!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.500
Yeah!

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.870
I'll go shut 'em up.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.750
Let 'em have it.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.090
Just this one night.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.380
--Gabi! Gabi! Gabi...!
--Me! Me! Me...!

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.970
They're lifting her up again.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.810
They shouldn't let my brother drink.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.850
And Gabi gets carried away too easily.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:13.730
Still, it's looking like she'll be the one
who inherits the Armored Titan.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.820
Yeah. The girl who adores you
will inherit your Titan...

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.570
...and will live till she's 27.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.540
If cannons don't shred her first, that is.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.910
Are you fine with that?

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:36.920
What did you say? Are you insulting
the honor of inheriting one of the Nine?

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.300
If I report this, you and your whole
family will become Titan weapons.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.600
W-Wait! Let me rephrase what I said!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:52.190
I, Falco Grice, hope to be freed from
the evil blood of Ymir and my ancestors!

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.440
I pledge my life to Marley!

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.480
And what about the honor
of inheriting one of the Nine?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.530
I would be proud to be an Honorary Marleyan

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:06.240
and be given the chance to display
my loyalty to our motherland!

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.290
Do you want to inherit the Armored?

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.670
Thank you!

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.500
The one who should inherit it... is me!

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.460
Yes.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.340
Huh?

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.930
You have to rescue Gabi from
the dark future that awaits us.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Eldian Armband"
"These armbands are used to differentiate the Eldian 'devils' from the other races. Eldians of higher classes may have armbands with different colors. Armband color can also vary depending on if the Eldian is in the military or a regular civilian. It is mandatory for Eldians in Marley to wear their armband when they go outside.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.370
We're back!

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.660
We made it back alive!

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.870
It's our beloved hometown, Liberio!

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.290
--We're home!

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.710
--Gabi...
--We're home!

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.170
Could you please tone it down?

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.790
Ow, ow...

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.380
You should've known
you can't hold your booze.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.470
Who's the one who gave him the drinks?

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.930
He looked like he wanted some.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:14.100
Unbelievable. How dare you spew
Pieck's kindness all over the train.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.150
We should've shut 'em up last night.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.860
I heard they kept hoisting you up.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.400
Because of Colt!

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.780
I think it's fine. You deserved a bit of fun.
What you did was impressive.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.660
Pieck!

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.540
Vice Chief Braun...

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:42.130
What if he's thinking the same as me...
and he wants us Eldians to be free from war?

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.430
Can I... trust him?

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.650
Later. Take it easy and enjoy the break.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.560
Not me! It's back to training tomorrow!

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.110
Trying to boost your grades? Gimme a break.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.650
I am not!

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:09.910
Hey, you two. Don't push yourselves too hard.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.630
Dad!

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.090
Zeke...

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.840
Grandpa! Grandma!

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.760
I'm home!

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.310
You achieved great things, Zeke.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.520
No, not yet.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.270
Colt! Falco!

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:40.980
Colt!

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.440
Dad! Mom!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.570
--Gabi!
--Gabi!

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.820
Reiner.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.580
You must be tired. Come home and rest.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.620
Mom... I think I will.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:02.630
Go on ahead!

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.260
For crying out loud!
Do you not know how to stand?

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.630
Are they injured soldiers, Mr. Koslow?

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.720
Huh? Stay outta the way, brat.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.720
They're Eldians with emotional trauma.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.310
Even our guys?!

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.100
It's from digging trenches
on the front lines too long.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.480
All those bullets and bombs do it to you.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.030
Boom!

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.280
Look! They fell over again!

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.530
You okay? It's all right!

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.160
Your armband's on the wrong arm.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:45.920
It's okay. I'm sure you'll get better.
You don't have to fight anymore.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.340
Boom!

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.670
Whoa!

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.800
Just like I planned, I blew the
armored train right off the tracks!

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.810
It actually worked! But as I ran away,
they fired a machine gun at me!

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.390
And just before I ate lead...

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:04.020
...Galliard protected me with the Jaw Titan!

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.770
Amazing, Gabi!

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:12.490
You and your bravery saved a bunch
of our soldiers! You're the savior of Eldia!

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.030
I'm so proud of you!

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:20.410
Reiner. Do you think Gabi
will become a Warrior?

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.750
Yeah. It's almost a given she'll
inherit the Armored Titan.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.710
That's good to hear.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.680
To think our family would have
two Warriors. I'm so proud.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:40.640
If only those island devils disappeared,
we Eldians could finally be happy.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.190
But, Reiner... Even you barely escaped
from the island devils, right?

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.150
Don't, Dad!

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.900
He survived on that island
of rotten devils for five years!

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:58.080
Even if it wasn't classified,
it's stuff he wouldn't wanna talk about.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.200
You're right. Forgive me, nephew.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.670
No, I can talk about it.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.790
I infiltrated their military.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.840
Every last one of 'em
was a savage, heartless devil.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.050
During the entrance ceremony,
one of them started eating a potato.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.060
The instructor yelled at them,
but they hardly seemed to care.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.890
Said they stole it 'cuz it looked tasty.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:30.940
Realizing they crossed the line,
they said they'd share half with him.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.900
But the piece of potato they offered
wasn't even close to half.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.280
Being considerate doesn't
even cross their minds.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.580
They're truly beyond all help.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.750
There was an idiot who forgot
why he went to the bathroom...

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.040
An insincere jerk who only
thought about himself...

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.380
An uptight oaf who only
cared what others thought...

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:58.930
A single-minded fool who charged ahead
and the chumps who followed him...

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.510
There were all sorts of people there.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:03.810
And we were there, too.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.150
My days there were true hell.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.740
I've said too much. Forget it.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.700
What do you mean, "all sorts of people"?
They're bad people, right?

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:28.000
That's right, Gabi. Those island devils
turned our world into hell.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.340
There's no knowing when they'll attack
with giant Titans and flatten the world.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:38.340
It's up to good Eldians like us
to make sure they never do.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.430
Mmm.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:45.390
Those who left us and fled to the
island deserved to be punished.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.310
They're the ones who abandoned us.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.660
What's wrong, Gabi? You seem down.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.370
Aunt Karina's worried about you.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.580
She says you changed after
coming back from the island alone.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:13.460
Her 12-year-old son came back a grown man.
You can't really blame her.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.750
It feels like you're lying.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.380
Lying? About what?

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.470
I don't know, but I think Aunt Karina does.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.720
I heard it was a soldier.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.060
That's awful.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.350
Good morning.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.190
Everyone's here?

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.730
It's not every day we meet
in the war chief's room.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.440
Where's the brass?

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.660
Not in this room.
Can't we just meet for some tea?

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.370
Right...

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.870
Now then,

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:53.670
the last battle made it clear that normal
weapons will overtake Titans in the near future.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.840
The weaker Marley becomes,
the more the Eldian race is threatened.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.380
Our existence is in danger.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:08.470
To rectify this, Marley must obtain the
Founding Titan and Paradis' resources.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:13.770
The world must be strongly reminded
of the threat that island poses.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:17.400
To tell that story, we need a narrator.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.740
The Tybur family will fulfill that role.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.740
The family holding the War Hammer Titan?

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:29.080
It's said the Tyburs have never sent
the War Hammer Titan to enemy soil.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.330
They're influential abroad for driving away
King Fritz during the Great Titan War.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.960
The world will listen to them.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.920
That's Pieck for you! Precisely!

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.430
But the Tyburs have been living
the life in their huge mansions.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.890
Why come out of the woodwork now
and pretend to be heroes?

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.850
I know how you feel, but the Tyburs
are concerned about Marley, too.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.440
But we--

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.110
If it saves our motherland
Marley, I'll be grateful.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.250
Our Warrior unit can cooperate with the Tyburs

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.780
and serve as the backbone for restoring Marley.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:11.620
Indeed. Here in Liberio,
there will be a festival soon.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.620
Festival?

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:19.170
VIPs from abroad will be invited to hear
an announcement from the Tyburs:

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.090
"Within a year, we'll control Paradis Island."

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.930
The fate of Marley and all Eldians
rests in this plan. It cannot fail.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.850
For the future of our motherland Marley,
we must join our hearts as one.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:40.650
Galliard seems to have some complaints,
but he always gets the job done.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.780
If that's all they're saying, I'm not concerned.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.570
Except that one line of Zeke's.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.200
Hmm?

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.990
"Not in this room," huh?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.380
Am I going back...

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.090
...to that island?

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.150
Honorary Marleyan. Esteemed Warrior.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:48.240
What he wanted to be. What he couldn't be.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.660
Is the path that he's walked down
truly the right one?

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.540
"The Door of Hope"

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "The Door of Hope."
