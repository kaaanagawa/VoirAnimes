00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.770
I keep having the same dream.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.190
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.910
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.740
Obviously, that's something
we'll never know.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.910
I bet he wanted someone to forgive him.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.210
Considering we left Marcel and ran,
it's not like we can say much.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.920
For some reason, I can't help but think:

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.010
That old man, I think what he wanted...

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
...was to be judged by someone.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.190
Hey. It's been four years, Reiner.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.610
Um, huh? Aren't you two
supposed to be old friends?

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.070
Isn't that right, Mr. Kruger?

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.540
Yeah. There's so much to catch up on.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.660
I don't even know where to start.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.960
Impossible...

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.960
Eren!

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.020
"Declaration of War"

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.030
Lord Tybur, it's almost time.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.740
Right.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.530
My goodness!

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.750
Well, well! Come to give me
a pep talk, Madam Azumabito?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.130
I hope I'm not a bother.
I just came to see your face.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.340
Given my stage fright,
I'm sure I look hideous.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:27.510
No, you look courageous.
My whole clan knows how brave you are.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.980
I wish you the best of luck.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.650
I appreciate it, Lady Kiyomi.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.270
Sit down, Reiner.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.610
They're good seats, right?
You can hear everything on stage.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.700
The building above us is all housing.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.380
It's behind the stage, but it's full of
people waiting for the curtains to rise.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.510
Directly above us.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.930
Huh? Kruger? Did you hurt your hand?

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.970
Yeah. It's just a scratch.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.480
Reiner, sit down.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.650
Well, I think I'll head back.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.360
No, Falco.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.530
You should stay here and listen.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.700
Huh?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.450
Falco... Just do as he says.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.460
Okay.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.960
Now then, shall we leave?

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.390
Oh! Long time no see, Mr. Leonhart.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.600
Ms. Braun... Not since
your son came home, right?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.600
Speaking of which,
I hear Hoover passed away in bed?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.610
Yes. He never failed to say how proud
he was of his son's sacrifice for Marley.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.320
I'm sure your daughter also--

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.370
She's not dead.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.620
Annie is alive. She promised
she would come back.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:24.840
To think, war will be declared in
the internment zone, of all places.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.340
Whoa! Even General Calvi came to the zone!

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.220
The whole backbone
of Marley's military is here!

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.390
And all these powerful families and ambassadors!

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.020
Not to mention every newspaper
in the world that matters.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.230
It's like we're in the world's spotlight!

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.530
The Tyburs sure are powerful.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.530
Yet they're Eldians, same as us.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.450
Eep!

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.990
It's begun.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.580
Falco and Mr. Braun aren't back yet?

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.290
Warriors of Marley,
Commander Magath has summoned you.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.570
Eren... How? Why did you come here?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.120
Same reason you did.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.870
Don't you get it? The same reason you did.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.210
Because I had no other choice.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.380
Sounds like it started.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.090
Let's listen.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.520
Let's look back in time.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.890
Roughly 100 years ago,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.770
the Eldian Empire ruled the world
with the Power of the Titans.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.900
From the rise of Founder Ymir until today,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.870
Titans have robbed enough lives
to eradicate humanity three times over.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.880
Countless cultures and peoples
have been wiped out by Titans;

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.890
their histories stolen away.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:38.680
The Eldian Empire's path of slaughter
became humanity's history.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:47.230
And when the Eldian Empire ran out of enemies,
they soon began slaughtering one another.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.440
The Great Titan War had begun.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.280
Families holding the eight Titans
waged a bloody war.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.500
Using this to his advantage,
one Marleyan sought victory.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.500
It was the hero, Helos.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.790
Thanks to his clever manipulations,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:10.800
the Eldian Empire was tricked into
killing each other, one by one.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.880
By joining hands with the Tybur family,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.470
they forced the unbeatable King Fritz
to flee and retreat to the island.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:28.690
However, though he fled to Paradis
Island, his power still remained.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:36.160
Tens of millions of Titans await on
the island to trample the world.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:43.710
To this day, the only reason we haven't
been trampled is merely a fluke.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.080
Our scholars have no other explanation.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:54.590
To eliminate this threat, our motherland
Marley sent four Titans to the island,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:09:00.220
but they were beaten back
and only the Armored Titan returned.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.350
The darkest blot on humanity's history,
the Eldian Empire, is alive and well.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:13.360
You hear that, Reiner?
Isn't that why you destroyed the wall?

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.070
You guys were trying to save the world.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.950
Weren't you?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.580
You're wanted at the gate, Jaeger.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.540
Fine.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.420
This way, you two.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:35.090
I feel like I've seen you somewhere
before. Where are you from?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:42.640
Out west by Lakua, but I was called here.
I didn't come to chitchat with Eldians.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.890
That's a shame. I kinda fancy your beard.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.020
Oh!

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.560
It's Pieck!

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.280
The Panzer Unit! Thanks for all your hard work!

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.700
W-We should be thanking you.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.780
You're in a good mood today.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.240
What are you doing? Let's go.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240
What was that?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:08.420
Since they ride the Cart Titan into war
and all, it's good if we build a bond.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.130
Didn't you just put a rift in that bond?

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.460
Anything?

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.090
Nothing strange as of yet.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.640
I don't care how small it seems.
Report everything to me.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.930
Yes, sir.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.980
In here. Enter.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.690
Where's Commander Magath?

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.900
Porco!

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:47.580
What's going on here?
Why is Vice Chief Braun so scared?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.250
Isn't Kruger an old friend of his?

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.210
Old friend? Like, how many years ago?

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.430
If it's more than four,
they met on Paradis Island!

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.560
No, there's no way!

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.560
Because that means...

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560
Impossible...

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.980
Could it be--?!

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The Paradis Island Operation
to Retake the Founding Titan" "A mission executed under the command of Theo Magath. Four Warriors were sent to complete the mission: Marcel Galliard, Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover, and Annie Leonhart.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.980
Their objective was to infiltrate Paradis
Island, retake the Founding Titan, and return it
to Marley. Five years after it began, two Warriors were captured by the enemy and one other was killed. Though a prisoner possessing the Jaw Titan was brought back to Marley, of the original members, only Reiner returned safely."

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:21.610
Now then, the story I've told
thus far is common knowledge.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:26.160
However, the truth is somewhat different.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.330
In passing down the War Hammer Titan,
the Tybur family inherited its memories.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:38.510
I will now reveal the truths we learned
for the first time ever.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.590
Some 100 years ago,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:47.810
it was neither Helos nor the Tyburs
who ended the Great Titan War.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:54.940
The one who ended the fighting
and saved the world... was King Fritz.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.230
He anguished over the
Eldian Empire's vicious history,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.950
tired from the endless infighting,

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.950
and above all, he was pained by
the endless oppression of Marley.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.410
When he inherited the Founding Titan,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:17.800
he schemed with the Tybur family
and they fabricated a Marleyan hero.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.420
His name: Helos.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:27.220
The King moved as many Eldians as he
could to the island and closed the gates.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.890
He claimed that if they were threatened,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.230
thousands of Titans would be
unleashed as revenge.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.070
However, this was never his intention.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:45.780
King Fritz made a vow renouncing war
so his ideology would be inherited.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.490
Because of this, Karl Fritz's ideology
has been passed down,

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.460
and the Titans have never left
the island to attack.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:02.090
That is, the one keeping our world safe
is the "vile" King of the walls--

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:06.140
Karl Fritz, and his desire for peace.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.430
Peace was all he wanted.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:17.730
But if Marley grew strong and came
to take the Founding Titan or his life,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.900
he would accept it.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:26.910
He believed the sins of the Eldians were
so grave, they could never be atoned for.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.580
"However, until that day of retribution,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.580
let me savor a brief paradise,
free of conflict within the walls.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.460
That is all I ask of you."

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.170
That was his last request.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.170
Huh?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.260
What does this mean?

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.010
If this is true...

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.970
Marley and the Tyburs saving the world
was made up by King Fritz?

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:59.610
If the King of the walls won't attack,
why do they say Paradis Island is a threat?

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.650
Yes... In exchange for our safety,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.820
the Tybur family joined hands with Karl Fritz
and sold out the Eldians to Marley.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:16.120
We're no more than traitors
lavishing in crookedly earned honor.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.420
The reason that I stand here
and willingly part with this sham

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.550
is because I know our world is in great peril.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.130
Commander!

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:32.810
The Warriors and soldiers
sent to get them are missing.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.970
Mobilize a search team!

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.480
Yes, sir!

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.480
Has it begun?

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.570
Damn, that hurt! Shit...

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.820
What the hell is this?

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.240
Must be a pit to restrain Warriors.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.120
It's a classic trap--too cramped for
one of us to transform, let alone two.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.380
Yeah, we'd be squashed to death.
Why'd that scrawny soldier even do it?

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:08.300
I don't know, but I feel like
I've seen them before.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.180
Stand there and watch. This is my atonement.

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:26.610
Using the power of the Founding Titan,
Karl Fritz erected three walls.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:31.740
These walls, formed by
tens of millions of Colossal Titans,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.200
have served as a shield and spear,
safeguarding peace.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.040
But recently, an uprising
took place on Paradis Island.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:48.050
King Fritz's peace was undermined by
a person who stole the Founding Titan.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:54.430
Once again, there's a threat to
our world--a rebel against peace!

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.310
His name: Eren Jaeger!

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:06.940
You tricked me... And here I respected you...

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.990
But you tricked me!

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:14.070
I'm sorry, Falco. I needed your help.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.450
Huh?

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.790
The letters! The ones you had me send!
What were they?!

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.090
They didn't reach my family,
but they did reach my comrades.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:34.930
No way! You're kidding!

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.560
Y-Your comrades?

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:45.560
The threat of Paradis Island is the stampede
of millions of Colossal Titans--a rumbling.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.230
As I mentioned, the vow renouncing war
prevents the King's bloodline

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.570
from fully using the Founding Titan.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:58.580
But currently, this "Eren Jaeger"
who possesses the Founding Titan

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.580
may begin this rumbling at any moment.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.500
Once the rumbling is set into motion,
there is nothing that we can do.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:14.050
Nothing but tremble at the
footsteps of doom, fleeing in vain.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:21.640
All lands and civilizations will be trampled,
literally razed to the ground.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.140
That's right.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.100
Huh?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:32.110
It's like Willy says--I'm the bad guy.
I might just destroy the world.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.610
But to me, you were the bad guys, too.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:42.580
That day, when the wall was destroyed
and Titans invaded my hometown,

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.410
I watched my mom get eaten.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.380
I couldn't understand.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:55.880
Why, Reiner? Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.430
Because... on that day, we broke the wall.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.600
Why did you break the wall?

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.520
To sneak in during the chaos
and see how the King would react.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.690
What was your mission?

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.530
To retake the Founding Titan and save the world.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:23.910
I see... If it was to save the world,
you didn't have much choice.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.540
Back then, you told me:

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.460
"I'll make you guys suffer and die
in the worst way possible."

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.920
Isn't that why you came?

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.590
Oh, I vaguely remember saying that.

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.050
Huh?

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:44.100
Just forget it.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.520
True, I saw everyone on the other side
of the sea as my enemy.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.270
But then, I crossed the sea,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.990
slept under the same roof
as them, ate the same food...

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.950
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.410
Sure, there're jerks here, but good people, too.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:14.210
Across the sea, within the walls...
It's the same.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:19.840
But you guys were taught everyone
in the walls was a devil.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.390
You were children who knew nothing,
but it was drilled into you.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.350
You were just kids. What could you even do?

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:36.110
Right, Reiner? Hasn't that
been eating away at you?

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.610
No! You're wrong, Eren!

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.700
That day, when Marcel was eaten,

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.790
Annie and Bertholdt tried to turn back
and end the mission.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:57.670
But I... I talked them into it
and made them go on!

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:04.640
I wanted to be a hero!
I wanted people's respect!

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.720
It's my fault!

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.560
Your mom was eaten by a Titan because of me!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.940
I cursed the blood I was born with.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.400
More than anyone,
I wished the Eldians were wiped out.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.370
I'm sick of this... of myself! Just kill me!

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.490
But I do not wish to die.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:33.540
And that is because
I was born into this world.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.380
We are people of different races and nations!

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:44.260
However, it is time to join as one
and face this dreadful enemy!

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.060
Lend me your strength,
those of you who wish to live!

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.940
Those of you who wish for a future!

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:00.070
If we work together, we can
overcome any obstacle in our way!

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.320
Like I thought, I'm the same as you.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.530
Huh?

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:16.250
I want you to join me in the fight
against the devils of Paradis Island!

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.550
I think we were born this way.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:26.590
Here and now, as representative of
the Marleyan government, I proclaim...

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.220
I keep moving forward.

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.310
Huh?

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.100
Until I destroy my enemies.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.950
...to the enemy forces of Paradis--
a declaration of war!

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.310
The Attack Titan suddenly appears.

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:48.490
Amid its roars, the crowd
is slaughtered mercilessly.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.530
To stop Eren's rampage,
the War Hammer swings.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "The War Hammer Titan."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.490
"The War Hammer Titan"
