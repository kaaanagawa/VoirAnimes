WEBVTT

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.030
Hey...

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
It's dangerous here...

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.080
Fly away...

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.290
...somewhere... far away.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.340
Falco!

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.510
--Huh? What's my brother doing here?

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.550
--Good!
--Huh? What's my brother doing here?

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.840
You're still talking!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630
Colt!

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.850
Time to run! Hold on!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.690
Falco!

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.450
Colt? Status report?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.000
It was a direct hit.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.960
The Eldian unit at the front got blown away.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.380
And the trench?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.550
It's hopeless! We can't dig any farther!

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.220
We can't? You're calling the shots?
An Eldian, giving orders?

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.640
Watch your tone with
Commander Magath, you mutt!

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.100
But... at this rate...

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.400
Falco, are you drunk?

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.730
He must've hit his head good.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.900
Do you remember this war
we've been in for four years?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.200
Who... are you guys?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.570
Wait... Huh?

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.580
Wasn't I flying around
with a sword just now?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.460
Like, whoosh!
And there were Titans that I--

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.750
Guess I'll just have to explain
everything from the start.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.630
Listen up good, Falco.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.550
This battle is the climax of a war
that's lasted four years.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.810
If we can take out Fort Slava...

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.560
Well, technically, if we sink the Mid-East
Allied Forces fleet in its port...

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.400
...it'll spell victory for Marley
and end the war.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.070
But unless we take Fort Slava
sitting on the high ground,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.950
it's hopeless to attack the port.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.870
Why can't the Marley fleet just do it?

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.500
Seriously, Zofia?!
You have faith in the fleet?!

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.380
--It took those imbeciles four
years to control the seas!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.500
--Ow! Ow, Ow! Ugh! Ow!
--It took those imbeciles four
years to control the seas!

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.050
--Ow! Ow, Ow! Ugh! Ow!
--And guess what?! They lost
half their damn ships doing it!

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.020
Now they're telling us they're too
chicken to attack till we take the fort?!

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.430
Screw 'em all! They're pricks!

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.100
Udo, you're gonna squeeze Falco's head off.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.940
Whoops! Sorry!

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.950
So what's the deal? Why'd they send us
Warrior candidates to the front lines?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.490
To judge us, obviously.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.750
To pick which one of us
will be the next Warrior.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.870
The time is coming.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.000
Commander Magath chose the
front lines to be our final test.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.550
He knows what's on the horizon.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.180
The plan to conquer Paradis
needs a main player--

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.220
the successor of the Armored Titan!

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.030
"The Other Side of the Sea"

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.830
The Armored Titan...

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.830
I wonder which one of us it'll be...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.840
Really, Gabi? Sounds to me like you're
saying none of us come close to you.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.590
Because you don't, right?

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.970
Well, Gabi does have us beat.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.800
As far as our grades go.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.640
No. There's more to it than grades, Udo.
I keep telling you.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.560
The difference between us
is that I'm prepared.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.980
To shoulder the fate of us Eldians...

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.950
...and to slaughter that island of devils
who've done nothing but make us suffer!

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.160
I'm gonna win this battle

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.370
and prove that the Eldians left
in this world are good Eldians!

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.580
I refuse to lose till I free everyone
from the internment zone!

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.340
Um, what exactly are you doing?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.180
Pretty cool, right?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.930
It won't work, Commander Magath!

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.230
We can't destroy the railroad without
the machine gun slaughtering us first.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.730
They've got soldiers along
every inch of the trench.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.650
To top it off, the fort can
bombard us whenever they want.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.410
If we stay here too long,
they'll just shower us with shells!

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.280
Do you have a better idea, Colt?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.080
We should let Jaw and Cart loose.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.830
Galliard and Pieck will get it done.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.250
They'll wipe out the trench
and bunker in a flash.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.210
No.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.380
If we play our cards wrong, we lose.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.010
Commander Magath, "that" showed up.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.680
What's "that"?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.930
That. An armored train.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.850
It's equipped with four
massive cannons in total.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.860
They're the Allied Forces' new
weapon--anti-Titan cannons.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.910
If one of those 150mm rounds hits
a Titan, it'll kill it in a single hit.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.330
Even one of the Nine.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.660
But both of our Titans are incredibly fast.
The odds of hitting their nape--

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.170
And if they did?

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.790
We would lose a Titan and a Warrior...

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.340
...with no guarantee that
we get their powers back.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.430
That's right. Just like our plan nine
years ago to retake the Founding Titan

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.680
resulted in us losing the
Colossal and Female Titan.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.400
The perceived hit to Marley's military
might is what sparked this war,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.980
putting the Paradis Island Operation on hold.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.240
What is it that makes our
motherland Marley so great?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.240
The Power of the Titans.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.910
Correct. Our nation won't last
if we keep losing 'em.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.500
The Power of the Titans is absolute,
and it must always remain that way.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.300
Prepare the Eldian unit for attack!

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.300
Yes, sir!

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.050
Commander Magath! But that's--

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.550
What's the matter, Eldian?

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.890
Are you not warriors who
swore loyalty to Marley?

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.940
This is a chance for the 800 Eldians here...

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:27.230
...to serve our motherland with honor.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.950
All creatures drink of 
joy at nature's breast...

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.240
Everyone up! Prepare to attack!

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.330
C'mon! Stand up!

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.580
Eldians!

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:49.550
Your mission is to assault and
destroy the enemy railroad!

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.680
The suicide squad will rush the bunker
and disable the machine gun!

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.310
Listen up! Let your actions purge the
disgrace of being spawn of the devil!

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:05.020
This is your chance to be honored
by our great motherland Marley!

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.770
Prove yourselves worthy!

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.360
Yes, sir!

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.860
You Warrior candidates are to stand by.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.370
The 800-strong Eldian unit must
destroy the rail at whatever cost.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.290
As long as that armored
train is patrolling the fort,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.540
the Armored and Beast Titan
can't do what they came for.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.000
But...

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.550
Colt. As the chosen successor
of the Beast Titan,

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.630
learn what it means to lead already.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.690
Perfect. We can destroy the train, too.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.270
Please, let me take a shot at it.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.730
--Huh?
--Ta-da!

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:57.360
If you'll let me, I can disable
the armored train all on my own!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.450
Hey, Gabi!

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:06.040
How much do you think Marley's spent
training you all these years? Hell no.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.420
It's true... I am exceptional
compared to Falco and the others.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.340
There may never be another
Warrior as talented as I am.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.470
Not to mention one this cute.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:24.310
But if I succeed, we won't lose
the whole unit of 800 Eldians!

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.020
And if you fail?

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.860
You lose just one promising candidate
and seven hand grenades.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:41.200
If you think I'm more valuable than 800
Eldian soldiers, I totally understand.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.500
You love me so much that you'd rather sacrifice
the lives of 800 soldiers over me--

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.120
Fine.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.830
Go ahead.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.210
Gabi, don't--

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:59.050
I swear! I will prove to you that I'm worthy
of inheriting the Armored Titan!

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.600
What are you doing?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.770
For this to succeed...

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.100
...please allow me to remove my armband.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.600
Very well.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.570
Hey, someone's coming this way.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.250
It's a woman. Girl, actually.
I think she's surrendering.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.080
No, wait. She might be Eldian.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.340
It looks like something's wrong with her.
She's dragging her leg.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.300
What if she's Eldian?
Shoot her before she turns into a Titan.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.260
Screw that. If you wanna
shoot her, you do it!

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.890
Shit.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.360
What the--?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.120
Wait...

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.000
Wait for it!

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.000
Wait!

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.090
She ain't moving.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.010
Who cares? Shoot her!

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.350
Now's my chance!

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:40.530
She really did it!

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.700
Galliard! Hurry up!

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.330
Dammit! You Marleyan cowards!

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.160
This is why you bastards...

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.210
...all deserve to die!

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.840
Gabi!

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.460
Falco, don't!

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.190
Galliard! Huh?

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.540
The armored train has been disabled.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.590
We'll now commence the airborne assault.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.970
Remember to stick to the plan.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.510
Zeke will be our spear...
and Reiner will be our shield.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.020
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Marley: A Military Dictatorship"
"Following the Great Titan War where the hero Helos led them to victory, Marley was revived as a formidable military power. Utilizing seven of the Nine Titans as 'Warriors,' Marley conquers enemy nations with their overwhelming strength. In addition to their Warriors, Marley's army, navy, and airborne forces assist in trampling their enemies."

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.120
Damn, that hurts!

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.500
Why'd a Marleyan like me get shot at?!

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.960
--What are you doing, Falco?
--You Eldians are supposed
to soak up the bullets!

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.840
--Can't you tell?
--You Eldians are supposed
to soak up the bullets!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.960
He's in no shape to fight us anymore.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.800
Udo, gimme a tourniquet.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.130
--Here.
--Stupid kids.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.100
Screw the enemy.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.310
Is that supposed to be your selling point?

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:22.350
You really think obeying the laws of war
will earn you the spot of Armored Titan?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.980
It's not gonna help, you know.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.570
Like I care?

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.570
Weirdo.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.030
He's saying something.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.370
Interpret, Udo. Say I stopped his
bleeding and that he'll be fine--

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.290
"Don't touch me."

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.590
"I'll be tainted."

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.460
"You devil," he says.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.430
Retreat!

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.890
Hurry up!

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.190
Get away from the fort!

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.110
Don't get caught in it!

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.700
It's begun.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.640
Ahem!

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.610
No! Stop!

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.830
Truly devils...

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:54.420
Our Marleyan ancestors
were eaten, just like that.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.720
By you Eldians.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.260
Fire!

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.730
The kinetic bombardment went well,

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:15.820
but due to the altitude,
roughly half died on impact.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.080
A lot of the anti-Titan cannons
are still operational.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.330
Twenty-eight... Twenty-nine...
And now I know their locations. But still...

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.630
More walls?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.010
I'm sick and tired... of walls.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.110
--It's the Armored!
--Kill it!

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.540
Fire!

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.960
Anti-Titan shells that
penetrate even my armor?

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.760
What the--?! What hit me?!

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.970
An armored train? There's another?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.990
Shit!

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.450
Fire--

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.750
Galliard!

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.000
You son of a whore!

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.490
Nice!

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.000
They got it under control?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.300
Our defeat brought about this war, Reiner.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.060
Isn't war a terrible thing?

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.920
Finally... With this, the war will be over.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.010
Huh?

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:27.300
What?!

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.880
With their fleet destroyed,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.140
the Mid-East Allied Forces signed
a peace treaty with Marley.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:13.310
The war spanning four years
ended in a Marleyan victory.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:20.650
But as the world learned that the era
of Titan domination was coming to an end,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:26.860
Marley was pressed to obtain the
Founding Titan as quickly as possible.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.160
Oh, no...

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:39.580
Thanks to the incredible bravery of the
Marley army, Fort Slava has fallen at last!

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.170
Unbelievable!

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.000
That's our Marley army for you!

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.030
"Titans are not absolute."
Marley was shown this painful reality.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.820
Victory providing a brief joy,

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.410
the warriors return to
their hometown of Liberio.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.540
"Midnight Train"

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "Midnight Train."
