00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.290
What do you want to do, Mikasa?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.530
Do you want to help Eren?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.760
I want to help him.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.640
But I'm sure it's because I'm an Ackerman.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.750
Just like what Eren said.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.500
This is not my own will.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.410
Huh?

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.240
I think that's just a lie
Eren came out with.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.170
It's true that I get headaches
from time to time.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.730
Why would you think he was lying?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.830
Why you ask?

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.580
Making it so that Eldian can
no longer have children...

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.970
did you all seriously think
Eren would want that?

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.710
I did think that's unlike him
to think that,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.440
but it's not impossible--

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.880
But it's impossible!

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.110
It's Eren we're talking about!

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.350
Then why he doesn't oppose
Zeke and Yelena?!

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.570
Because he doesn't have to!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.590
It's up to Eren to decide what to do
with the power of the Founding!

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.930
From the moment Yelena made her proposal,
he had no choice but to go with it.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.600
If he refused, who knows what method
Yelena will use to persuade him.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.500
But if he accepts their proposal and
makes them believe he's on their side...

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.630
He could protect this island
with the Rumbling!

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.260
And no one will be able to lay their hand
on Paradis island for the next 50 years!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.120
Is it okay for us to go now?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.670
I'm sorry, but please wait
just a bit longer.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.060
I've been saying he's a dangerous guy
from the time we're in Training Corps.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.490
That Eren is a piece of crap
who will lead us all to hell.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.070
And I was jealous of that piece of crap.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.820
Because he was so cool.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.170
It pisses me off to no end,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.080
but I don't want him to die just yet!

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.650
Yeah.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.350
I'll lose my chance to punch
that bastard if he dies here.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.660
Let's go!

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.770
Come on, stay close to me.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.350
If Eren really is hiding
his true intentions,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.670
why did he push us away from him?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.630
He said he hated me.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.360
Why would he say that?

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.760
Well...

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.390
Hey...

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.820
If we kill all our enemies… over there…

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.590
…will we finally… be free?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.200
Could it be...

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.420
At the very least,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.250
both Eren and I know about your occasional
headache since we were little.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.150
He must've used that to add
more credence to his lies.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.690
I bet he didn't have time
to think of a better lie.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.250
We can just ask him after
it's all over.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.900
Don't forget.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.700
This ambush is only possible thanks
to Willy Tybur's sacrifice.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.820
Just as he risked his life to tell us,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.460
we need a true hero like Helos!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.830
A hero who will save the world.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.670
Eren...

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.240
Enough already.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.990
You lost.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.550
Everyone has suffered enough.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.260
You've suffered enough!

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.780
Why struggle?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.010
What are you fighting for?

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.160
Just for what?

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.200
Galliard!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.130
Dammit...

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.210
I took a clean hit...

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:22.670
Eren.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.160
I just want this to be over.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.830
Just what makes you think we're alike?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.650
It's enough.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.450
Just... sleep already!

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.670
There he is!

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.690
The boy wonder!

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.570
I'm a little late,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.140
but I finally got here as promised.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.350
You did well holding on your own,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.020
Eren.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.430
Just leave the rest to your big brother!

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.380
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.290
Rumbling, Rumbling

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.260
Beware

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.680
Coming for you

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.650
All I ever wanted to do was do right things

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.320
I've never wanted to be the king, I swear

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.280
All I ever wanted to do was save your life

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.410
I've never wanted to grab a knife, I swear

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.840
Tearless, fearless, burning, burning

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.090
You tell me what have I missed

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.680
Still wandering in the deep mist

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.720
If I lose it all, slip and fall

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.560
I will never look away

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.480
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.400
If I lose it all outside the wall

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.740
Live to die another day

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.120
I don't want anything

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.500
I'm just here to...

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.540
Beware

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.920
(Deception)

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.410
Damn you, Zeke!

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.260
We'll blast through his nape!

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.540
Get in position!

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.750
Yes, sir.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.600
Hurry, Pieck!

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.370
I believe it's not wise to engage
in a shootout with the Beast.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.210
No, I have to punish this traitor myself!

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.470
But...

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.550
Pincer the Cart!

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.550
Yes, sir!

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.860
The Beast's attack incoming!

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.360
Get into cover! He'll target us!

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.780
The Founder is heading towards the Beast!

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.600
So their goal was for the two
to come into contact after all!

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.740
We must stop them!

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.120
But how can we do that?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.710
We have no choice but to leave
the Titans to Titans.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.490
We have our own battle to fight.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.550
I'm going to rescue Falco from the enemy.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.780
You should head south to
the airship and wait for retreat.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.280
No, I'm coming with you.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.760
I got Falco involved in this.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.050
Not only that, he saved me many times.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.250
I'm the top of the unit,
but all I did was relying on his help.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.630
I can't just run from here without him!

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.690
Open up!

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.400
What's going on outside?

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.610
We don't want to die locked in here!

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.780
Hey! Let us out!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.330
It's gotta be the attack from Marley.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.380
Maybe they're here to save you.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.250
There's no way the Marleyan army
would do that.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.540
Just to rescue an Eldian.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.840
But you have a family waiting
for your return, don't you?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.870
This is your only chance to go home.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.480
I'm sure I'll never get to see
my wife or daughters again.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.110
All it takes is Zeke's Scream,
and I'll turn into a monster.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:56.660
I still have so much I wanted
to tell my girls, too.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.430
I'm as good as dead.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.720
Hey, stop!

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.270
This area is under Yeagerist's control!

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.530
You can't just--

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.670
Tell me, recruit.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.170
We're out here to save
the great Yeager.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.480
Will you still put your life
on the line to stop us?

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.340
No.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.440
Open all the cells at once!

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.420
Instructor Shadis!

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.990
Oh, Connie.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.560
I fought a bear.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.700
Forget about me.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.720
Go.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.630
Commander Pixis!

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.390
Are you okay?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.650
I'm not senile just yet.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.820
But I did have a little too much drink.

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.760
Listen up, all of you!

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.960
We have a limited supply of
Vertical Maneuver Gear here.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.640
Priority goes to those
without black armbands.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.740
All of you drunkards who fell for
the enemy's scheme, follow me.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.730
We'll fight off the invaders
on the front line!

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.200
Yes, sir!

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.130
I'm glad.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:24.400
To be able to fight alongside you
for the same goal again.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.070
I see.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.330
You're not taking that scarf with you?

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.420
I am leaving it here.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.180
The Shiganshina gate has been blocked?

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.560
Zeke has taken down their ships.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.740
The moment that will
change the history is near!

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.540
Umm...

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.390
I suppose the one
who needs our help is... Reiner?

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:16.640
Why?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.080
Why is Zeke here?

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.120
There's no way Captain Levi
would let him go free!

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:25.040
Hey!

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.320
What happened to Captain and Hange?!

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.410
I believe it's right to assume
Zeke has defeated them.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:35.960
Since he has appeared here and now,
just as he promised Eren.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.780
That's impossible!

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.670
It's a shame, but we have no choice.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.180
It's the only way for Zeke
and Eren to save the world.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.150
We should join the Yeagerist and
help put them together!

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.770
Please help Eren and Zeke.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.500
I believe in you.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.160
The airship...

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.120
Dammit!

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.210
By the way, what's this iron pipe?

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.840
It's an anti-Titan rifle.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.450
But they say it's hard to kill a Titan with it
unless you hit the nape perfectly.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.170
There they are!

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.110
The entire city is in fire...

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.500
There's nowhere to run.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.500
What are you saying? Fight!

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.640
What's wrong?

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.810
Crap!

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.220
They spotted us.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.400
It's my brother.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.070
I see.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.560
Now come with me.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.950
Marleyan POW!

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.220
I'll detain this POW
in one of the homes.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.820
We'll go without you.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.990
Don't get left behind!

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.260
Seems like we'll have to fight.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.190
Wait!

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.430
This is not a place for a child.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.900
Go back home.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.220
Let's go!

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.450
Mr. Nile...

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.610
Thank you.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.730
Take this!

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.580
They're gone now.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:48.830
Gabi.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.230
Why did you trust the enemy?

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.890
Well..

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.720
This way.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.600
The flames won't spread here.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.560
True, but the exits are
all blocked by the fire.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.630
We should hide around here
until the battle is over.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.930
I wonder if Mia and Ben made it out.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.430
Those two will be fine.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.560
They're strong kids.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.240
- Hey!
- I can never forgive her.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.250
Why are you worried about
the girl who killed Sis Sasha?

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.690
I wish I could kill her.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:42.890
Looks like they're gone now.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.410
We should go too.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.060
Gabi?

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.710
There aren't any devils.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:55.030
There are only humans in this island.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:00.030
I finally understand how Reiner feels.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.000
We one-sidedly call
all these people devils

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.460
even though we never met them before.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.300
For over and over...

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.830
We keep doing the same thing
over and over.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.130
I'm sorry, Falco.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.000
You knew all along.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.560
But I got you involved.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.760
I helped making the attack
on Liberio happen.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.190
I met a wounded soldier at the hospital,

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.820
and without knowing he was Eren Yeager,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.530
I sent letters from him to his allies
using the mailbox outside the zone.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.700
A lot of people died in Liberio.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.660
So...

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.900
It's my fault that Udo and Zofia died.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.050
I see...

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.360
Also, I love you!

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.640
I didn't want you to
inherit the Armored Titan.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.510
That's why I became a warrior candidate.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:08.560
So that we could get married and
make you happy forever...

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.970
I wanted you to live a long life!

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.690
What... are you saying?

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.740
I might turn into a Titan at any time,

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.830
so I want to let it all out
before I'm gone for good.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.320
Let's go!

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.430
If Zeke knows that you drank
the spinal fluid,

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.690
we might be able to stop
him from using his Scream.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.500
No good! There are too many of them!

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.270
We can't get near Eren!

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.110
Eren.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.540
Just a little more.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.250
Just a little more and our dream
will come true.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.180
Just a little more.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.180
That's...

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.720
The Cart Titan...

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.580
So that's where you end?

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.330
My dear Pieck.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.330
We did it! We killed the Cart Titan!

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.830
Right when we thought
we finally caught up.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.380
Who took it out?

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.330
Eh? You guys killed it, right?

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.910
Drive them off!

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.750
We can only make one shot
with this sneak attack.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.800
General Magath!

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.880
Did you kill him?

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.090
I can't get an angle on him!

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.230
We should move!

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.430
Braun!

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.760
Don't let the Beast and
Founder get into contact!

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.920
Are you doing it, Eren?

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.700
Please, just stop.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.130
The last person in this world
who should have that power...

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.950
Eren.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:53.900
It's you!

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.810
Pieck, hurry!

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.070
If there's even a single
speck of life left in him...

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.910
...he will surely scream!

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.200
The iron bullet is the proof of justice

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.780
If it pierces through,
I'll be closer to being a hero

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.500
But when I close my eyes and touch

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:23.040
I notice that the devil
was no different from me

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.500
Why am I not good, but he's okay?

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.210
The only thing that
separates us was the wall

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.880
Don't lament on the fate that we're born

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.760
Because we're all free

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.020
If only I have wings like birds

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.360
I can go anywhere I want

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.440
But if I don't have a place to return to

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.870
I'm sure I can't go anywhere

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.830
I just simply hate living

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:11.880
The world is cruel, but I still love you

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:21.980
I will sacrifice anything to protect you

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.190
Even if it's a mistake to do so,
I'll not doubt my actions

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:33.610
Because the right thing
is to firmly believe in yourself

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.920
The Beast and Founder.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.090
In pursuit of the two Titans that
hold the key to the whole situation,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.420
people keep on fighting.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.090
What lies beyond the path
the brothers took?

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.850
Next time, "Two Brothers."
