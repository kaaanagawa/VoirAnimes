WEBVTT

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.190
We were abandoned.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.480
That's why we live in a camp
surrounded by walls.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.570
Because the blood of devils
runs through us.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.740
That's also why your father isn't here.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.370
Your father... is Marleyan.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.460
He can't be with us Eldians.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.710
If only we were Marleyan...

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.470
Oh, yeah...

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.690
Back then, I strove to be a Warrior
so we could be Marleyans.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.110
Who said you could walk?!
Run, you filthy seed of swine!

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.320
Don't you wanna be Honorary Marleyans?!

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.120
Did you guys hear? We're attacking
Paradis Island in just a few years.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.210
Huh?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.710
It's almost time for us to inherit Titans!

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.260
Out of the seven of us, they're picking six!

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.840
Yes! I can finally be Marleyan!

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
Huh? Why so excited?
If anyone's the worst, it's you.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.180
Excuse me?!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.190
What's your strong point?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.100
Huh?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.440
Your strength? Your brains?
Your aim? Combat ability?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.370
Nope. The only value they see in you
is your loyalty to Marley.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.080
"I'll slaughter the island devils
real good for you, sir!"

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.000
You making fun of our mission?!
Or maybe you're a stray Restorationist?!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.880
Huh?!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.260
You are, aren't you?!
I'll report you to the commander!

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.380
Report this, you little shit!

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.720
Want some more?!

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.010
Porco, enough!

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.260
Hating the island doesn't make you special!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.640
Have fun waiting 13 years alone!

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.980
--Tsk!
--Porco!

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.730
Let's go, Pieck.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.450
Don't cry too long or the
commander will chew me out.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.530
Reiner, I'm sorry.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.790
Stand up, Reiner.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.120
C'mon.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.090
I'm gonna become a Marleyan
and live with my mom and dad.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.130
I can't wait 13 years.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.470
But it's like he said. I'm the worst.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.180
Porco doesn't make the decision.
Besides, loyalty is important.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.560
Right, Annie?

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.900
Huh? What? I wasn't listening.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.450
You really want that as your goal?

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.410
Huh?

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.330
Thirteen years is all you get.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.120
Thirteen years to be a hero.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.710
If I crush the devils on Paradis,
I'll save the world.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.340
Then my parents will be proud
to have me as a son.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.770
I wish something would happen.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.310
Eren! There you are!

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.030
"The Door of Hope"

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.160
Marvelous. Even better than we expected.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.840
The Female Titan.
Versatility is its biggest strength.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.300
On top of its mobility and endurance,
its hardened strikes are incredibly destructive.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.060
The range is limited,
but it can call Pure Titans, too.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.680
Leonhart is perfect.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.270
The Armored Titan specializes in hardening.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.230
If it charges in at full speed,
the gates of any wall will crumble.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.990
As Marley's shield that must withstand attacks,
it suits Braun's perseverance.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.330
The Jaw Titan is an assault weapon.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:02.040
It's as speedy as it is small, with claws
and jaw that crush nearly everything.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.340
Entrusted to the quick-witted Marcel.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.590
The Beast Titan is as potent as ever.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.970
Though slightly larger than the other Titans,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.140
its throwing technique is dreadful
on another level.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.520
What's more, his blood
seems to have hidden power.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.360
The Cart Titan has outstanding endurance,
suitable for long missions.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.910
It can be outfitted with different
equipment to extend its usefulness.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.960
Pieck's superior judgment will serve well.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.290
And then, there's the Colossal Titan...

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.050
A god of destruction.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.020
Hoover will be able to handle it.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.230
I feel bad for those island devils.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.270
One day, that's gonna show up to kill 'em.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.320
This new Warrior unit may
outperform their predecessors,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.570
but I question the military's decision.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.540
Sending children to retake the
Founding Titan sounds insane to me.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:23.290
You think? Didn't those children
just crush a nation before our eyes?

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.210
It's messed up! Why was
the worst of us chosen?!

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.590
What did you do?!

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.760
Seems you're the worst.
That's all there is to it, Pock.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.430
You little--!

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.060
Porco! You sure you wanna defy the brass?!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.350
Huh?

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.150
Reiner... I'm sorry.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.650
Huh?

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.960
Dad!

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.090
It's you, right? Mom used to work in
these barracks before I was born!

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.550
That's where you met her! Karina Braun!

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.390
Look at this! Mom and I are
Honorary Marleyans! We can all live--

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.180
Bloody hell!

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.020
Did that woman send you here?!
To get revenge on me?! Shit!

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.060
Now her kid's a Warrior?!

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.570
If they find out where you're from,
my family is screwed!

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.490
You're gonna get me hanged!
I'm running the hell away!

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.870
Away from you and your damn Eldian mother!

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.620
Reiner!

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.660
Reiner!

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.120
I'll be waiting for you!

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.590
That's right. Even without a father,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.340
I'm still the chosen Warrior
of the Armored Titan.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.220
I'll save everyone from the island devils
and be the world's hero.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.230
We didn't cover much ground tonight.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.980
Can't do much about the clouds.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:18.410
Will the King really not use the Founding
Titan, even if we break the wall?

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.330
What's the use asking now?
Trust Marley's research.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.790
That's right. We can't turn back.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.460
Tomorrow, we reach the wall... and then...

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.720
Huh? What? Are you having second
thoughts about killing the devils?

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.600
Have you forgotten what they've done?

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.310
We're the world's chosen Warriors
sent to punish the island devils!

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.230
I'm sorry.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.190
Huh?

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:56.450
Reiner, I'm sorry. You were never meant
to be chosen as a Warrior.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:03.990
I talked you up and criticized
my brother to influence their decision.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.200
Huh?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.710
I... just wanted to protect my brother.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.300
I'm sorry, Reiner... I'm sorry!

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:23.220
Why... are you apologizing?

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.170
Bertholdt...! Annie...! Marcel...!

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.630
They got eaten!
They got eaten because of me!

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.010
And I'll be next!

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.890
This is where I'm gonna die!

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.470
Not bad.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.810
This is a first. You actually beat me...
in a long-distance... race...

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.650
Huh?

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:20.490
If we... took out that Titan...
we wouldn't have... lost Jaw...

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.660
Shit! Now Marcel's gone for good.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.200
They said there wouldn't be Titans this far out!

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.790
We've gotta go home.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.660
Huh?

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.670
Let's find Jaw and leave.
They would've changed back to human.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.670
Besides, without Marcel to lead,
this mission is doomed.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.180
Wait...

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.510
We can't...

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.810
We can't!

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:52.440
We can't go home!
We've gotta continue the mission!

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:59.320
Oh, yeah... If we go back now,
you'll just get eaten by the next Warrior.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.820
Not that I give a shit.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.700
You think only I will?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.410
Huh?

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.370
That only I'll get the blame for running away?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.620
You guys are that certain
you won't get eaten, too?

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.960
Catching Jaw won't be easy either.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.300
If they used its power and ran,
our Titans could never catch up.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.470
They can't control it right after becoming--

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.390
You controlled the Colossal Titan, no problem!

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.930
Anyways, we're doomed at this rate!

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:34.230
Without the Founding Titan,
there's no going home!

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:39.110
Back there, if you were a fraction
as calm as you are now,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.610
we wouldn't have lost Marcel or Jaw.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.370
But you've got no problem intimidating
us to save your own ass, huh?!

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:54.120
How about you come clean to Magath?!
Tell him, "It's all my fault!"

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.500
Honorary Marleyan, my ass!
Chosen Warrior, my ass!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.760
Marleyans, Eldians! They're all liars!
Everyone only thinks about themselves!

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.220
I'm no different! I've gotta get home alive!

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.600
If you feel guilty, just die!
Take all the blame and die!

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.410
Reiner is dead.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.200
If we need Marcel, then I'll be Marcel.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.250
Please, stop this...

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.790
This is the only way we'll be able
to go back home!

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.380
Let's go back... together... to our hometown!

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.740
Huh?

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.500
I wanted to be a Warrior.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:21.040
I thought I could make my mom's wish
come true and we'd live with my father.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.710
But... I had a father who
didn't want any part of us.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.090
My mom had a dream she knew
would never come true.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.970
I should never have been chosen.
I should have died today.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.850
Why'd he apologize?
Why'd he save someone like me?

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.610
No! I'm not ready for this to end!

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.030
I still don't understand anything!

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.330
Where is this?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.580
Inside Wall Rose.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.540
Annie... Bertholdt...

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.420
I'm sorry.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:10.510
Marcel... I'll be the Warrior I should've been.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:14.970
You! What the hell did you come here for?!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.970
To save humanity!

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Warrior Candidates"
"A unit of child soldiers consisting of Eldian 'devils.' Under command of the Marley army, they undergo harsh training and are selected based on their grades, skills, behavior, personality, and devotion to Marley.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.980
As only Eldian 'devils' can inherit the Nine Titans,
the existence of Eldians is crucial for the
defense of Marley. As such, Eldians selected to become Warriors are granted 'Honorary Marleyan' status along with their immediate family."

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.690
I lived in Wall Maria,
deep in the southeast mountains.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.900
It happened at dawn.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:35.120
The animals were all stirred up
and I heard a strange rumbling.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.000
Thinking it was footsteps,
I opened the window...

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.290
The rest is a blur,
but I ran away on my horse.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:49.260
Leaving behind three kids
about the same age as you guys.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:06.690
Hey, missy. You've got good taste
in men to tail a geezer like me.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.110
I was born at an inn.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:14.780
My mom, who works there, talks about
my father so much, I know that it's you.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:20.290
Well, that's real touching. If you want
a hug from papa, put your hands up.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.790
How are you sure it's not you?

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:29.590
I made a promise to my sister.
This joke of yours ain't making me laugh.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.130
You're so mean, papa!

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.810
Hey now... Having a rebellious phase, are we?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.020
That's a new one.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.520
Are his legs saying snow today?

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.780
Nah. That's the clear skies position.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.530
Call it hail or you'll be late for muster.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.070
Wake up, Bertholdt!

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.040
While you two snoozed
after playing with your friends,

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.210
I was busy crawling around
the capital's sewers.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.840
I've hit my limit if he's around.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.000
Your limit, huh?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.090
Let's take what we know back to Marley.
They'll be happy to hear anything.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.510
Do you honestly think that?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.310
Not if it's all we have to show
after five years.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.140
Then, what are you saying we do?!

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.270
Destroy Wall Rose.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.570
It's the only way we can
smoke out the Founding Titan.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.320
A lot of your friends are gonna die.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.990
I keep telling you:
They're not friends--they're devils.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:45.080
But gaining their trust can't hurt.
And frankly, your aloof behavior isn't--

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.670
I'm gonna barf. Can you move
your face away from mine?

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.510
I bet you're exhausted.
Sorry for always laying the burden on you.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.720
Let's call it a day.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.140
I keep having the same dream.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.940
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:17.490
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.960
Eren, take a break. You're gonna die.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.000
Shit!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.300
Reiner... How do you do it?

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.510
How can I get like you and Mikasa?

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:42.390
At this rate, I'll die without
doing a damn thing!

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.690
Just do what you've gotta do.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.020
Keep moving forward.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.990
That's all we can do.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:59.200
Yeah. You're right.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.120
Aren't you gonna drive out every last Titan?

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.200
I know you can do it.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.810
Shit! I can't let this go on!

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.610
That's right... I still have those guys...

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.290
The hospital...

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.750
Hey!

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.340
Um, I guess you're recovering well.
You're good enough to talk now.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:06.100
Kinda. I'm here for
emotional trauma, but it's a lie.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:06.890
Huh?

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:13.270
I said I lost my memory and can't
go home, but I just don't want to.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.570
It'd be hard to face my family now.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.320
Will you snitch on me?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.400
I wouldn't do that.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.530
You're hurt. Is it from your Warrior training?

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.250
Yeah, but I won't become one.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:35.460
Another candidate is so talented,
I don't even stand a chance.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.170
That's good to hear.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.000
Huh?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.840
You're a good guy. I hope you live a long life.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.970
But I don't want them to be a Warrior.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.520
Why not?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.810
Is the other candidate a girl?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:21:00.780
She's famous around here.
She did incredible things in the war.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.030
Everyone's saying she should
be the next Armor.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:10.910
But since I'm powerless,
I can't do a damn thing about it.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:20.590
Every day I'm here, I think:
Why did it ever come to this?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.340
Damaged minds and bodies...
Their freedom taken away...

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.100
Even losing themselves.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.680
If people knew it would come to this,
nobody would go to war.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.860
But most people are pushed by something,
forced to march into hell.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:47.320
That "something" wasn't their choice.
Their situation or others made them do it.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.160
But people who push their own backs
see a different kind of hell.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.920
They can see something beyond the hell.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.300
It might be hope.
It may even be another hell.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.550
Only those who keep moving
forward will ever know.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:46.280
Magath sorts out the military
for the Tybur family to tell the truth.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.170
As the festival enlivens the city,
an unexpected surprise awaits Reiner.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "From One Hand to Another."

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.540
"From One Hand to Another"
