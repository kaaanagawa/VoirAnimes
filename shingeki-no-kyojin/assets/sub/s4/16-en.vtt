00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.610
Wh-What the--?

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.320
What was that?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.030
Thunder?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.700
A Thunder Spear.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.870
But why?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.410
Let's head in that direction.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.770
It's so... quiet.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.690
Am I... dying?

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.030
"Above and Below"

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.600
"We'll dine at the same table again soon."

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.250
Hasn't it happened just like I said,
Commander Pyxis?

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.880
I appreciate your swift response.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.190
You gathered all soldiers in Shiganshina
and forbade opposition like we asked.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.980
Given the spinal fluid,
we didn't have much choice.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.110
Only Shiganshina was evacuated,
and we could become Titans at any minute.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.200
In any case, what else could I do with
comrades pointing guns at my back?

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.210
I'm sorry, Commander.
My son and I both drank the wine.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.210
Since when did you betray--?

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.220
There's no need to answer.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.220
Forgive me.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.970
It seems switching sides sooner
came with advantages.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.730
That white armband you wear so proudly
is proof you're a Jaegerist, no?

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.440
Red must be for those who learned they drank
tainted wine and were forced to comply.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.500
The rest of us fools who drank the wine without
knowing a thing are identified with black.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.250
Sounds like how Marley does things.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:41.010
Didn't they do something similar
when they took over your homelands?

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.010
We can learn a lot from our enemies.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.010
Such as how to make more of them.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.470
Was it not your people who
refused to side with us?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.970
That said, considering we failed to trust
guests who served us tainted wine,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.800
does that make us foolish or wise?

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.190
You were both foolish and wise.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.040
If you had trusted Zeke and us from the start,
the world might be saved by now.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.490
Hmm?

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.790
"The world might be saved"?

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.590
I was under the impression your plan
was to reunite Zeke and Eren

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.970
for a small-scale rumbling to keep other
nations at bay for the next 50 years.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.350
Won't only the island be saved?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.270
Yelena?

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.940
It's too late. Zeke gave you plenty of time.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.910
And you answered his mercy
by planning to kill him.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.580
Zeke is the god who will save the world
and you've earned his wrath.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.590
So? All we can do is sit here
while it all plays out?

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.550
Care for tea?

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.840
Thanks.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.590
Armin, could you bust out
of here as a Titan?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.470
No. I'd just destroy the city.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:20.520
Unlike Eren's Titan, the Colossal Titan
can't do something that precise.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.870
So? Why did Eren beat you to a pulp?
It's about time you tell us.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.040
He said hurtful things to Mikasa.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.500
I swung at him and he hit back.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.380
Huh?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.500
He hurt Mikasa? How?

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.960
--Well--
--Stop.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.380
It's fine.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.220
No, it's not. What exactly did he say?

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:57.730
Forget it, Jean. We already
know he's a total piece of shit.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:04.400
Now he's lost his mind and hurt the
two people he should care about most.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.820
I think if he was sane,
he wouldn't do it without a good reason.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.990
Do you think there's some sort
of meaning behind it?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.790
Long time no see, heroes of Shiganshina.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.380
It pains me to reunite in a place like this.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.920
Hey! You're on their side, too?! Let us out!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:35.850
That's a lot to ask, considering
you guys put me on house arrest.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.480
Just sit quiet and behave
until Zeke and Eren meet.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.810
You...!

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.560
Must be nice, Yelena.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.900
Everything went exactly how you planned.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.400
Through you, Eren moved how Zeke wanted.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:59.830
Raiding Marley, getting people's support,
using wine to take over the military...

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.420
Now, Eldia and the Founding Titan are yours.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.920
You can crush Marley
and avenge your homelands.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.130
Isn't that the real reason
you came to the island?

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.850
This place was primitive.
We brought it out of the past.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.720
Eh?!

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.690
So you and your pals could enjoy it.
Once you ruled, that is.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.230
You were tricked and lost. That's all it is.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:33.530
Greiz! Looks like you sold us out to get
promoted to Yelena's lackey, you snitch!

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.700
Are you dumb?

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:39.740
It's you who sided with
the devils and betrayed us!

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.750
What?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.920
You had the hots for some devil spawn
who reeked of potatoes!

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.040
I'm gonna kill you!

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.340
Chill, Nicolo!

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.840
You wouldn't shut up about her, day and night.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.720
Stupid me thought you'd
get a grip when the bitch died.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.260
What'd you say?!

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.140
I'll make it easy to understand.
That spawn-of-the-devil whore was--

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.190
Yelena?!

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.940
I apologize for his disrespect.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.240
This island has no need for
those who would call you devils.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:24.000
Believe me, our true goal is nothing
as hollow as getting revenge on Marley.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.090
Our goal is to end the cycle of hatred
to save Eldia and even Marley.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.510
No more secrets. I'll tell you everything--

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.850
about Zeke's plan to save the world:
His "euthanization" plan.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.810
They're devils, though. So, why am I...?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.490
Hey, brat who killed Sasha.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.990
What do you want?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.240
If you wanna save Falco, help me.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.580
Help... you? How?

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:14.880
Call for help on the radio to
flush out intruders in the walls.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.510
Don't move. Keep quiet, Gabi.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.060
--Pieck!
--Quiet.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:31.020
I take it you're Eren Jaeger, correct?

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.030
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Shiganshina District"
"The fortified residential district of Paradis Island where the Operation to Retake the Founding Titan began in 845. In the five years following the Fall of Wall Maria, it was inhabited by Titans. However, with the operation's failure, the hole was plugged
by Eren Jaeger and the current state
of the district is unknown. The primary goal of the new strategy is for the Cart Titan and Jaw Titan to infiltrate Shiganshina, the southernmost district."

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.200
Gabi, aim the rifle at Eren.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.160
Gabi!

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.090
Eren, hands out of your pockets.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.340
And what if I refuse?

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.760
I pull the trigger and
your brains hit the floor.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.100
Ever seen it? No time to transform.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:10.770
And? Why don't you pull it?
If not, why else are you here?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.060
What happens if I don't listen?

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.110
That's something you'll never know.
Once your brains hit--

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.240
I do know. You won't shoot.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.280
You aren't allowed to kill the Founding Titan.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.910
Your orders are just to retake it.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:34.710
But for that, you'll have to turn into
a Titan and eat me alive, right?

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.170
Pieck!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.760
Gabi, take your finger off the trigger.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.310
You're not the only one who
would pay for defying the military.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.230
Your family in the zone would, too.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:59.650
Yeah, I won't shoot. And eating you
doesn't seem possible either, so...

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.240
Pieck?

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.030
You found my Titan footprints
from when I invaded, right?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:12.790
I thought I did well sneaking
into your midst without being caught.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.000
But I have other reasons for not shooting.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.670
If you used the Founding Titan's power,
couldn't you defeat Marley?

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.970
You wouldn't make the world your
enemy unless you knew you could win.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.100
Do you have something more
than the Founding Titan?

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.610
Pieck, what are you...?

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:39.320
Gabi, put down the rifle.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.320
Supposing I did, what's your goal?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.530
To free all Eldians in Marley
and around the world.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.460
I want to free my family
in the internment zone.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:59.050
I became a Warrior to get my dad,
my only family, proper medical care.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:06.010
He survived, but he's incredibly sad
knowing my term will soon be over.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:13.430
Before I die and leave him behind, I want
to show him Eldia has a bright future.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:20.110
For that, Marley needs to be crushed.
I'll help however I can.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.740
If we can slaughter Marley,
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.040
The mastermind of the attack
on Marley... was Zeke.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.040
Now, you? What have we been fighting for?!

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:47.890
Once the world knows that we're good
Eldians, won't they let us go free?!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.260
You're the same as Zeke--a traitor!

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.680
Gabi.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:14:00.520
Are we Marleyans or are we Eldians?
What do you think?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.780
We're... Honorary Marleyans.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:10.950
Wrong. We are Subjects of Ymir.
That's the one truth we can't escape.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.120
No matter what we're called,
we're a race that turns into Titans.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.290
But like we saw at Fort Slava,
Titan power is on its way out.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:27.550
As soon as Marley can't use us,
they'll slaughter us all.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:33.890
Even if we prove we're "good Eldians,"
there's zero chance that we're freed.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.810
We have to secure our right
to live with our own hands.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:47.860
Prove it. If you're going to cooperate
with us, show us you mean it.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.700
I'll show you where my comrades are.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.450
Wha--?!

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:52.700
How?

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.160
If we go to the roof,
I can point out where they are.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.250
Fine.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.090
Stop children from being born?

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:08.470
Correct. That's Zeke's euthanization plan.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:14.760
All suffering brought about by Titans
will disappear from the world.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.430
Gradually. Peacefully.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:20.350
Wait. How is that peaceful?

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:27.110
If Subjects of Ymir slowly die out,
we'll only have geezers to defend in the end.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.530
How do we protect ourselves?
You think they'll leave us alone?

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:36.580
The rumbling can serve as a deterrent
as long as the Founding Titan

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.160
and the royal bloodline are preserved.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.540
Fortunately, Queen Historia
was blessed with an heir.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:50.720
As long as Subjects of Ymir inherit the
Founder until her child passes away...

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.390
You talk like this is a sure thing.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.680
Sure things... Certainties...
No nation can claim to have them.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.860
Each one has its own share of problems.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.730
But there is one certainty,
and that's the threat of Titans.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:16.240
Their history of tears and bloodshed
will be put to an end... by Zeke and Eren.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.790
I don't know how long humanity will last,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.880
but it's hard to think that a greater
feat will ever come to pass.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.970
People will speak of the brothers
as legends for millennia to come.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.090
Like the gods of the past.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:39.930
Even after their deaths, they'll be seen
as saviors who shone over humanity.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.900
Something wrong?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.230
No... But to think your cause was so noble...

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.950
It touched my heart!

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.660
That's wonderful.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.000
I'm glad to know you understand.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.790
Yelena!

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.960
Come quick! Invaders!

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.500
--The enemy's here!
--Someone was killed!

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.340
It's the Cart Titan!

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.300
--What?!
--Did she betray Marley?

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.220
That's what Jaeger said.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.550
Hmm? What's all the ruckus about?

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.980
Is it safe to say you and I are allies now?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.690
If you can point out the other invaders.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.980
Until then, you'll be cuffed to the Marley kid.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.070
If you try to transform, she'll bite the dust.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.990
Don't worry. This kid will
come around soon enough.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.160
--That bitty thing is a Marley soldier?

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.420
--She's an ally?
--That bitty thing is a Marley soldier?

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.670
Hi there!

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.640
Hey... Where is Falco?

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:05.890
Falco's here, too. But it seems he
drank some of Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.230
How?

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:14.070
Who knows? They're saying the wine
with spinal fluid got in his mouth.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.240
--Is that when...?
--Gabi?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.660
It's my fault... again.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:27.160
I see. You took over the military
with Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.790
Do you know why Zeke
even has an ability like that?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.970
Beats me. Do you know?

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:40.930
No. Other than Zeke himself, nobody does.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:48.890
Ever since I met him, I felt like
Zeke was telling lie after lie.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.400
Four years ago, I confirmed that hunch.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.280
Only with you did his words seem true.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:02.280
"Believe me, I know what you're
going through, Eren.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.080
Someday, I'm coming back to rescue you."

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.290
If anyone, I thought he'd tell you
about his secret power.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:18.840
For example, like it can draw out the
Founding Titan's power or something.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:29.940
Oh? You shaved your beard?
I thought it suited you.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:38.780
Eren, it's not safe to trust that woman.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.570
Yeah. I don't trust her,
either, but it's mutual.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:55.710
By the way, aren't you using the
Founding Titan's power? Where's Zeke?

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.050
You'll find out soon enough.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.550
Show me. Where is the enemy?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.860
There.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.110
What the--?!

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.820
It's begun.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.870
The Titans... have started to move.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.660
Galliard!

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.210
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.960
Pieck! You're not a traitor?!

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.210
Gabi! You thought I'd sell out my comrades?

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.220
But you said we have no future
fighting for Marley!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.590
Look.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.350
I don't trust Marley.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.190
But I do trust the comrades
I've fought alongside.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.530
There's the smoke signal.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.780
Pieck and Galliard have exposed his location.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.030
It's the Founding Titan.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.040
Go get revenge for Liberio!

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.830
Let's put an end to this guy.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.550
Bring it on...

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.430
...Reiner!
