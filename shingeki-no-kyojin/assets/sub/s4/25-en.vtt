00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.770
Of course, I'll ask for a prime
real estate in the central region.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.830
That's where I'll be gulping down
the finest liquor at all times of day.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.030
I won't let anyone complain about it.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.890
I've earned the right to live a happy life
with my wife, my kids, and even my grandkids.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.040
Jean, it's me.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.410
We're waiting outside.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.930
I didn't notice that.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.060
I didn't hear a thing.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.530
Don't go.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.840
Don't think.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.970
If you just stay here...

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.750
that prime central real estate is yours.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.340
Just stay...

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.920
I'm glad you came, Jean.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.530
Mikasa was filling me with the situation.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.430
I'm sorry I couldn't have been
on the site with you guys.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.640
You have done well under
such an adverse situation.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.550
As for Levi...

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.570
He's not unscathed, but he's alive.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.850
He won't be able to fight
for a while, though.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.760
And lastly,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.710
we joined forces with the Cart Titan
and remaining Marleyan forces.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.340
It's to stop Eren.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.750
Genocide is a mistake.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.530
How will we stop him?

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.720
We must first gather allies.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.760
What we can do depends on
who we have on our side.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.960
But we're powerless without the help
from you and the Nine Titans.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.450
The old chain of command has been wiped out
and I'm no longer your superior.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.710
With that in mind, I ask you--

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.780
I'll do it.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.980
I don't want to let Eren
slaughter anyone else.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.050
Even if he's doing so to
protect us and this island,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.100
I want to stop him.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.890
Mikasa...

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.380
If we can somehow stop Eren...

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.550
What will you do?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.530
Even if Eren can maintain
the Founding's power,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.580
he only has four years left to live.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.880
What'd happen to this island after that?

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.500
If for decades to come,
far into the future...

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.710
The world still continue to loathe us...

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.310
Then stopping Eren would also mean
leading this island to its doom.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.010
From how I see it...

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.590
The Marley assumes the Rumbling happens
immediately after their surprise attack.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.930
At the very least, they won't lay
their hand on this island for a while.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.980
"Unless we destroy that island completely,
we'll never know when they'll destroy the world."

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.230
It'll just stir up more rage
than Willy Tybur's speech!

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.450
You may be right.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.200
Either way, even if this island
is to be destroyed,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.450
we'd still get at least a few years to spare.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.380
But the last time we decided to explore
possibilities with the time we had,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.680
we couldn't solve a single thing!

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.700
That's why Eren decided to
wipe out the world--

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.090
Genocide is wrong!

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.660
There is...

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.280
There is no right reason
to commend such an act!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.880
I'm sorry.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.990
I shouldn't have shouted like that.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.770
Just like Jean said,
Eren was pushed to do this...

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.670
...all because of my feckless idealism.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.900
And I might be howling about it...

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.330
But I was trying to run away.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.070
To abandon everything...

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.770
To forget it all and just survive...

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.220
But I'm still the Commander
of the Survey Corps.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.060
Many of my comrades dedicated their heart
for the freedom of humanity...

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.030
...and I can feel
they're all looking at me.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.930
Almost all of them died without even knowing
that humanity exists beyond the walls.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.600
"It's all good as long as
this island is free."

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.730
Do you think a single of them
would've been so selfish to say that?

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.710
We only have one chance
to stop this genocide.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.840
And that is now.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.520
Hange.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.620
I'm...

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.010
I'm still a member of the Survey Corps.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.020
(Night of the End)

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.960
Can somebody help me?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.300
Or maybe stop staring
at each other like that.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.340
So you want us to eat together after
all the time we spent killing each other?

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.660
It's quite curious.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.660
What changed your mind?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.480
If you just let Eren Yeager be,
you'll attain the world you wished for.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.980
A paradise for the island devils.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.670
We were so close to stopping
Eren and Zeke coming into contact.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.970
Had it not been for you guys helping them.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.210
Like I explained, General.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.690
None of us wished for a genocide.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.970
Otherwise, we wouldn't be hiding here
in the forest and make a stew.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.640
So you're saying you finally
see whose side justice is on?

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.380
Justice?

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.300
Did you just talk about justice?

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.390
You're saying we're the bad guys
for fighting back

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.090
against the Titans
you people kept sending?

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.300
Listen!

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.040
We fought as hard as we did because
we didn't want to be eaten alive by Titans!

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.510
And you're saying that's something
only a devil would do, you old geezer?!

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.770
Yeah. You do look like devils to me.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.940
All our fears about the threat
of Paradis have come true,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.410
and the world's on
the brink of destruction.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.660
This is the result of all your struggle.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.340
Isn't it?

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.070
Listen here.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.180
If he hadn't watched his mother eaten alive
when the wall was breached...

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.300
Eren would never have done
anything like this!

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.850
You people left him with no choice
but to use the Rumbling!

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.680
Oh, so now you want to talk about history?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.820
You should at least understand
that Eldia was the first

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.970
to devastate Marley and
put our people through hell.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.440
How long are you going to play the victim
over something happened two millennia ago?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.400
Good grief, it's like I'm talking to a child.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:24.840
You think nonsense like that holds up
in face of two thousand years of real history?

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.920
What did you say?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.450
Aaah, let's stop this.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.330
An argument over what happened 2,000 years ago
when you're not even there bores me.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.360
Jean.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.510
The General is perplexed
over our existence.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.950
To him, we're strange devils
who'd abandon our own paradise

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.620
just to save the very people
who tried to eradicate us.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:00.250
We lived in the outside world
for several months.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.430
We can never go back to being
the ignorant island devils.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.910
So?

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.320
Can you guys kill him?

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.110
Can you kill Eren?

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.990
Killing Eren isn't the only way to stop him.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.510
I knew you would say that.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.440
Then what?

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.080
Are you going to persuade him?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.980
You think the guy who'd
reconsider that easily

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.650
would begin genocide
on the rest of the human race?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.470
We don't know.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.850
Not until we talk to Eren.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.780
Then assuming you managed to talk to him.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.100
What would you do when
he refuses to stop his genocide?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.190
Has thinking of Eren as the enemy
turned you into idiots?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:01.960
I knew it.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.570
If those of us from Marley try to protect
our homeland by killing Eren,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.230
you'll end up fighting us to protect him.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.890
I'm sure of it.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.850
That's how it'd end up, right? Mikasa?

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.660
I'm sure never in your life you ever thought
of anything more precious to you than Eren.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.690
So you're saying you need to kill me?

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.020
Eh?!

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.310
Leonhart!

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.680
I get how you must feel.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.150
I also have one reason I want to stop Eren.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.400
I don't want my father
in Marley to be killed.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.100
That's why I need your help.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.890
If you can convince Eren to stop,
then great.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.350
At the very least, we have
no reason to fight until then.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.710
Fine.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.650
There, there!

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.330
Come on, the stew is ready now.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.530
Let's eat.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.850
Even after resting the horses,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.430
it'll still take five hours
at full speed to the harbor.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.620
We'll have to rely on the Azumabito.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.530
According to Miss Kiyomi,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.650
there's a flying boat meant to observe
the Rumbling ready at the harbor.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.270
We can use that to get close
to the Founding Titan.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.270
I knew it. So the Azumabito were
helping you behind the scenes.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.800
The problem is locating the Founding Titan.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.810
We'll run out of fuel in no time
if we just fly around aimlessly.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.650
Yes. That's why we captured her.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.370
Where would Yeager be headed first?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.230
How should I know?

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.650
Even if I did, why would I tell you?

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.430
Yeager had no knowledge of the mainland.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.890
So you must've told him
what he needed to know.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.680
He's planned out which direction
his Titans will head toward.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.480
You should be able to make some guesses.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.460
Shit head.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.650
Hmm?

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:32.410
I'm asking why I'm ought to help
a Marleyan shit head like you.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.750
Remember we get to decide
whether you live or not.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.350
It's pointless.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.110
She's eager to die.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:43.490
But aren't you fighting Marley
to save your own homeland?

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.900
Are you okay letting it
get trampled like this?

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.860
Yelena?

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.660
She's fine with that.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.240
Because...

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.100
She's a Marleyan shit head
just like the rest of us.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.050
You've completely outwitted us
in Libero, after all.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.200
Yelena.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.940
We looked into your past,
and found some surprises.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.920
You were born into a perfectly normal
Marleyan family,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.140
but you pretended to be from
a small nation annexed by Marley.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.160
It was right after you met Zeke.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.820
After becoming disillusioned by Marley,
you crafted a story.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.600
A miraculous fairytale of how you
and the prince saves the world.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.160
You tried to solidify your lie
into an indelible part of human history.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.520
I'm impressed by the depth of your desire.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.750
To save the world.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.920
Are there any words sweeter
and more alluring than this?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:01.820
You give yourselves to the sublimely exciting idea
that you will save hundreds of millions of lives,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.390
and gulp it all down, as if to wash away
all the hatred you felt in the past.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.690
That's how all of you look
in my eyes right now.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.460
Let's take a quick look into the past.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.940
Reiner Braun.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:34.690
Who knows how many Eldians lost their life
because you breached the wall that day.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.550
Annie Leonhart.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.970
I've heard you've killed quite
a lot of the Survey Corps members.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.640
Including a large number of residents
in the Stohess District.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.850
And of course, the same goes
for the soldiers of Paradis.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.790
You're usually a very sensible
and decent person,

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.340
so I've never thought I'd see you
to raze a military port so mercilessly.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.430
Armin.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.040
Your military accomplishments
should be relative

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.960
to the mountain of corpses you left behind,
including the civilians'.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.860
I have vivid memories of the brave acts
the rest of you have done in Liberio.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.960
Especially Jean.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:25.160
You valiantly hurled a Thunder Spear
at that little boy Falco to defeat the Cart.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:31.440
And Gabi, the girl over there,
shot Sasha to death.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.290
Sasha was a really good girl.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.560
Even I was sad about that.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.590
However,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.010
for all of you who think of her as family
since your training corps days...

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.900
Your sadness and hatred
easily dwarf mine.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.520
This stew is delicious, Hange.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.900
Can I have more?

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.270
Yeah, there's plenty more.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.080
Thanks, Yelena.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:09.580
You were trying to air out all our grudges out
so we can get our minds straight, weren't you?

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:16.290
Right when your dream you're so committed to
that you blew up your friends' brains out

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.600
just to attain ended up failing,
and all you wish now is death.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.170
I say it's very considerate of you.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.140
Oh right, I almost forgot.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.380
What was it again?

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.730
The name of that good friend of yours
that you once told me about...

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.410
Oh right, it's Marco.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:50.460
You said Annie was involved
in his death, didn't you?

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.390
Have you asked about it yet?

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.840
The truth behind his death.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.660
I took off Marco's Vertical Maneuver Gear.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.810
That's why a Titan ate--

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.490
Annie was only following my order.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:19.160
Marco overheard the secret conversation
I had with Bertolt.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.770
In fear of our cover being blown...

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:28.360
I thought the best way to silence him
was to have a Titan kill him.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.800
I slammed Marco into
a roof while in the air.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.910
And while I hold him down
so he can't move,

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.960
I had Annie take his
Vertical Maneuver Gear from him.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.780
Marco then stuck there until
a Titan came up and ate him.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.810
Did Marco say anything at the very end?

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.010
He said, "We haven't even had
a chance to talk this through."

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.880
Yeah...

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.670
He's right.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.860
We haven't been trying to talk this over!

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:12.680
That's why we've been fighting each other
to death like this, isn't it?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.950
It's still not too late.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.330
We've been on each other's throats
all this time.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.460
But at the very least, we're now talking
without trying to kill each other.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.520
Who could've imagined this?

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.090
That we'd be all eating
around a fire like this.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.250
As I watched the Titan eating Marco...

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.780
I wondered why Marco is being eaten.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.480
Eh?

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.190
Then I flew into a rage and killed that Titan.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.140
Claiming it was for Marco--

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.460
That's enough!

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.340
You're saying the guilt messed
with your head, right?

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.030
Don't forgive me.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.750
I really am just a helpless--

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.220
I said enough!

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.630
I'm sorry.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.960
Hey, Jean!

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.920
Don't do it!

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.590
Stop it!

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.330
Jean!

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560
Gabi!

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.660
I'm sorry.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.190
We...

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:47.680
Our wish... was to slaughter
all of you... on Paradis.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.200
We wanted the world to accept us,
to forgive us.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:58.440
That's why we kept hoping for the devils
on this island to go away.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.260
And now, my mom, my dad...

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.890
and everyone on Liberio
will be gone because of it.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.350
I'm sorry.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.920
I know it's very impudent of me to ask this...

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.950
But we need your help!

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.070
Please... lend us your strength!

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.310
We beg you.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.180
Please stop the Rumbling together with us!

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.800
We beg you.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.420
We beg you!

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.520
We beg you!

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:41.670
We beg you!

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.590
We beg you!

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.950
We beg you!

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.980
Let go of me.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.330
Where are you going, Jean?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.230
Jean! What about your seconds?!

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.490
It's not working...

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.950
He left...

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.560
Gabi...

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.480
You guys are so loud.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.030
Wake up.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.270
It's time to go.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.420
You will help us?

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.410
Yeah. Of course.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.070
Come on! How long you're going
to sleep, Reiner?

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.940
You're already healed, aren't you?!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.170
Gabi.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.680
Sorry I kicked you.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.870
Are you okay?

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.300
Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.040
I see.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.730
Reiner, you won't get any apology from me.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.380
Yeah. That's fine.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.100
What about me?

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:31.510
The Cart's coming.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.080
Stop. Something's wrong.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:39.830
The harbor.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.030
The Yeagerist has taken
control of the harbor!

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.440
They must've gotten there first
by the steam engine.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.080
There are many soldiers with
Anti-Titan Gear surrounding the place.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.810
They're ready for combat.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.150
The iron bullet is the proof of justice

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.730
If it pierces through,
I'll be closer to being a hero

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.450
But when I close my eyes and touch

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.990
I notice that the devil
was no different from me

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.450
Why am I not good, but he's okay?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.160
The only thing that
separates us was the wall

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.830
Don't lament on the fate that we're born

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.710
Because we're all free

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.970
If only I have wings like birds

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:46.310
I can go anywhere I want

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:50.390
But if I don't have a place to return to

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:55.820
I'm sure I can't go anywhere

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:00.780
I don't want to just live

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:11.830
The world is cruel, but I still love you

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:21.930
I will sacrifice anything to protect you

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:27.140
Even if it's a mistake to do so,
I'll not doubt my actions

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:33.560
Because the right thing
is to firmly believe in yourself

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.190
Stopping Eren to save the world.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.100
As those who made up their minds step out,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.430
their former allies are
standing on their way.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.640
Next time, "Traitor."
