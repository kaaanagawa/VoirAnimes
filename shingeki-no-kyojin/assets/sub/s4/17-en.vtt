WEBVTT

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.220
Captain Levi?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.230
No idea what happened, but lucky us.
Our biggest threat is a bloody mess.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560
I'll put a hole in his head.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.230
--He's dead.
--Eh?

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.570
A Thunder Spear blew up in his face.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.570
The blast shredded his insides,
killing him instantly.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.950
Let me see him.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.290
I can take a pulse, too.
Let me see him.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.550
Floch!

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.060
It's vanishing? It died?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.730
No. When Titans die and disappear,
they don't suck in steam.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.420
--They're getting away!
--Shit!

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.840
--After 'em!
--Don't let 'em get away!

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.260
Zeke, what happened to you?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.390
I don't know.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.980
There was a strange girl
building my body out of soil.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.150
I was in some strange place
watching it happen.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.830
It felt like years passed by, but at
the same time, it felt like an instant.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.660
Was that...?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.500
I see... Were those the Paths?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.130
Zeke, you turned the 30 Scouts that
were guarding you into Titans, right?

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.050
Where are they?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.550
Well, they're all gone.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.480
Now there's nobody here
that will get in our way.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060
Let's go.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.070
All we can do is move forward.
Right, Eren?

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.960
"Judgment"

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.880
What the--?!

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.590
It's begun.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.930
The Titans... have started to move.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.480
Galliard!

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.850
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.860
Pieck! You're not a traitor?!

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.240
Gabi! You thought
I'd sell out my comrades?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.070
But you said we have no future
fighting for Marley!

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.450
Look.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.160
I don't trust Marley.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.420
But I do trust the comrades
I've fought alongside.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.130
There's the smoke signal.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.140
Pieck and Galliard have
exposed his location.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.560
It's the Founding Titan.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.390
Go get revenge for Liberio!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.730
Let's put an end to this guy.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.250
Push!

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.130
Pieck! Pieck!

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.930
Pieck!

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.640
Porco!

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.350
That hurt!

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.590
To think Marley would launch
such a desperate attack...

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.930
Given what little they know,
they shouldn't have taken this risk.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.440
Eren! Can you hear me?!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.150
Come out of your Titan body!

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.730
Hide inside and escape underground
with the War Hammer Titan!

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.950
If you fight, you're at a disadvantage!

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.210
Eren?!

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.930
Bring it on...

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.730
...Reiner!

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.030
Only you could've convinced Marley
to do something this stupid.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.530
Mobilize the troops!

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.330
Hurry! Protect Eren!

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.710
Eren... Why?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.990
Reiner! He really came!

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.920
Pieck! Over here!

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.010
Gabi!

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.350
Commander Magath?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.110
Dammit, Braun!
Why'd you go behind enemy lines?!

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.570
I-I'm sorry!

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.900
Unbelievable!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.320
Gabi!

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.450
Colt!

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.700
Where's Falco?

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.080
He's still in that building over there.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.840
He's being held since Zeke's
spinal fluid got in his mouth.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.340
Seriously?

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:23.140
He's being detained along with
around 300 soldiers who drank it.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:29.600
There're about 500 other soldiers
in the area, but Zeke's nowhere in sight.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.730
Reiner's fears are what brought us here.
Can the enemy use the Founding Titan?

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:42.530
I don't know, but it's safe to say
it's their trump card.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.620
The fact that they haven't used it yet

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:51.290
likely means the conditions
aren't right for Eren to use it.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.920
What are the conditions to activate it?

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:04.800
"Now we have the Founding Titan
and a Titan with royal blood."

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.850
I heard Zeke say that aboard
the airship retreating from Marley!

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:15.360
What? Are you saying Zeke
is a Titan with royal blood?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.780
If his parents were Restorationist
leaders, it's possible.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:26.120
Supposing that's where he gets his
special powers, it might just be true.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.250
If Zeke's absence is why the
Founding Titan isn't being used,

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.460
we can't let Eren and Zeke
come in contact.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.050
Commander! Reiner is--!

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.220
General. And Marley's shield
isn't easily broken.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.300
No, we're protecting more than Marley.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.640
The fate of the world
rests upon our shoulders.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.560
We're not here to kill the Founder
and put off the problem.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.980
We'll eat the Founding Titan
and end 2000 years of malice!

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.830
I'll make you pay...

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.250
...for trampling all over my home!

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.090
Eren... All on your own,
you're not a big threat.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.930
Just give it up.
This is the end for you.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.990
Now! Finish 'em!

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.410
Let's give 'em their favorite
snack--Thunder Spears!

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.340
--Wha--?
--What the--?

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.020
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Anti-Titan Gear"
"Following the raid on Liberio where the Cart Titan's turret gear was damaged, new gear was designed to defeat the Founding Titan. It improves upon the Anti-Titan artillery appropriated from the Mid-East Allied Forces by being designed to penetrate through even Titan hardening."

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.560
Load the next round!

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.440
Roger!

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.440
Got its brains!
The Attack Titan lost motor control!

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.820
Well done, Commander.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.910
You mean, "General"! And Marley's
military sure has fallen on hard times.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.790
Its best gunner climbed
all the way to its highest rank.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.960
Shit! The Armor and Jaw will escape!

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.100
--It's the enemy!
--They're on the roof!

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.270
There're too many!

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.930
But they're slow! Wrap around 'em!

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.190
No way... I thought most of
their officers were slaughtered.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.360
How'd they regroup in less than a month?

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.870
At this rate...

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.910
...the Founder will get eaten!

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:01.370
Eren, you're not like other people.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.040
You're special.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.230
Let him wear out.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.980
The War Hammer is powerful,
but its power exhausts quickly.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.990
Don't forget: This surprise attack
was built upon Willy Tybur's sacrifice.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:41.960
Like he gave his life to proclaim,
what we need is a Helos--a new hero.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.880
A hero to save the world.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.460
Eren, enough already.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.860
You've lost.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:13.570
Everyone's suffered enough already.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.280
You've suffered enough already.

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.540
Onyankopon.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.050
What's going on outside?!

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.470
Marley came flying in on airships.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:38.050
There're about 500 soldiers,
plus the Armored, Jaw, and Cart.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.180
And Eren is fighting alone.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.650
But he's struggling. He's not gonna last.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:52.860
Marley will steal the Founder!
Help us! We've gotta protect Eren!

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.110
Are you shitting me?!

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.280
What's this about "we"?!
This is your fight!

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.660
Why should we listen to you, you traitor?!

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.750
S-Sorry! But if I went against Yelena,
she would've blown my head off!

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.550
Eh?! You were just pretending
to be nice to us

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:16.680
while plotting to take over
Paradis with your wine!

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.600
I'm fed up with getting
betrayed all the time!

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:27.270
By Reiner! Bertholdt! Annie! Eren!
I'm sick of it, dammit!

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:33.480
Why the hell should we help Eren
if it means none of us can have kids?!

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.990
--Well?!
--Wait--!

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:41.410
Let's hear him out, Conny.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.960
I honestly had no idea.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.470
The wine, the euthanization plan...
The Volunteers didn't know!

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.180
--Eh?!
--He's telling the truth.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:06.350
Yelena told us to keep quiet.
She said not to tell the Volunteers.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.650
Besides, I don't want
Eldians to get euthanized!

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:16.440
I want to build Paradis together
and beat Marley side by side!

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.860
That's why I threw
everything away to come!

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.620
I gave my all to the people
of this island!

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:30.460
And I did it because I believed this
island had a future! Kids are the future!

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.760
If the euthanization plan is carried out,
what's the point of all our effort?!

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:43.510
Believe me!

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.930
I do.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.350
Armin?

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.060
You once said this:

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:57.320
"We exist because we're wanted--
including Subjects of Ymir.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.700
It's more interesting
with a mix of people."

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.620
You've shown that your views
basically go against Zeke's.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.330
You're that kind of person.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.370
On your feet, Onyankopon.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.210
Armin...

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.420
I believe you, too. But what now?

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:25.010
If we help Eren and Zeke, it means
letting the euthanization plan happen.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.140
No, we can stop the plan.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.400
But if we lose those two,
we can't protect the island.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.820
So, what are you saying we do?!

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.280
If nothing else, show off
the rumbling's might to the world.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.660
Eh?! The rumbling's might, huh?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.490
What do you think, Mikasa?
Do you want to help Eren?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.460
I want to.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:02.430
But like Eren said,
it's probably because of that...

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.550
Because I'm an Ackermann.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.720
This isn't my own will.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.440
Huh?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.860
I think Eren lied and made that up.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.450
But it's true that I get
headaches from time to time.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.700
Why do you think it's a lie?

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.660
Why...? Huh?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:35.170
You guys honestly think Eren wants
to stop Eldians from having children?

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.880
While I don't think it's like him,
it's not that outrageous--

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.550
It <i>is</i> outrageous! This is Eren!

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.720
So why doesn't he oppose
Zeke and Yelena?!

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.060
'Cuz he doesn't have to!

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.230
The Founding Titan's power
is ultimately his to use!

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:01.440
When Yelena brought up the idea to him,
he had no other choice!

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.070
If he refused, who knows
what Yelena would've done?

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:11.620
But if he goes along with it
and convinces them he's their ally,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.750
he can protect the island
with the rumbling!

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.210
Nobody will dare touch
Paradis Island for 50 years!
