WEBVTT

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:11.360
I doubt this is something you want
to hear, but just listen.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.990
Three years ago...

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.080
Back then, we still might've been able
to change something.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200
"3 Years Ago"

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.500
Captain! The team that went ashore
hasn't made contact for two hours!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.420
Hmm. Prepare to send teams two and three.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.720
Yes, sir!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.300
This island of devils defeated the Warrior unit.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.480
Whatever the cost,
Marley must learn what happened.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.400
Hang on!

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.860
I-It's a devil!

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.300
Hello, friends from Marley!
Welcome to Paradis Island!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.430
I'm Hange, here to greet our guests
who've come so far across the sea!

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.480
Now, step this way and join us for some tea!

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.820
By the way, we're already friends
with this guest that arrived before you!

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.490
Isn't that right, Nicolo?!

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.580
Captain! Forget about me
and shoot these devils!

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.200
--What are you saying, Nicolo?!

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.160
--Captain!
--What are you saying, Nicolo?!

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.250
He's tired of your shitty skit.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.510
Nicolo! Understand this, you devils!
Marley doesn't mingle with filthy blood!

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.050
Go drink your pig piss with your filthy friends!

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.020
Aww! Hey! You sure you wanna be rude to us?!

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.810
Can't you see the Titan behind you?!

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.490
We'll never yield to you devils!
Say hello to this!

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.920
Hands up, Yelena!

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.300
Drop your weapons.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.550
What are you...?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.630
Do as she says.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.640
Hange, I'd be happy to accept your invitation.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.760
Let's have tea.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.940
I've longed to meet you, Eren.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.990
"Brave Volunteers"

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.120
That huge lady of theirs
shot and killed her comrade.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080
Wonder what her goal is.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.750
Who knows? Whether friend or foe,
she's not to be trusted.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.300
No napping, Sasha.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.340
But their willingness to share
information is unbelievably lucky for us.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.890
Yeah, we've been really lucky.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.270
We stopped their landing by pure chance.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.400
If Marley comes in force, we'll be screwed.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.230
We've gotta do something.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.070
Ah, I see! That's how it shoots a bunch!

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.450
That's standard-issue in Marley.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.670
The Marley army has
20,000 soldiers per division.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.630
With 50 divisions, that's 1,000,000 soldiers.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.260
There's also the navy with three fleets,
each comprised of 21 battleships.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.810
They've made tremendous progress in
new weapons and aerial warfare as well.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.560
Aerial...?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.810
Tsk!

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.770
Don't freak out or they'll think we're weak.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.860
I know!

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.190
In other words, vehicles allowing one
to attack the enemy from the sky.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.650
Huh?! From the sky?!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.530
Hey!

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:57.040
If Marley had such capabilities this whole time,
why haven't they attacked in over a year?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.620
There are two main reasons.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.790
One being the Pure Titans released here.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.930
Even with the latest weapons,
they would hinder a land assault.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.310
They were used as a tool to
confine Eldians within the walls,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.850
but in turn, they've protected
Eldia from invasion.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.100
Yeah. Well, ain't that funny?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.650
Though dawn is coming soon,
and that's when Titans are active.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.530
But if we're way out here,
sipping on tea outside the walls,

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.160
you must have killed all
the Titans roaming around.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.370
Is that true?

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.000
And what if it is?
You gonna report it to Marley?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.170
No, it blows away my expectations.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.510
And the second reason?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.760
Currently, Marley is at war
with multiple nations.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.930
They can't be bothered with Paradis.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.850
You defeated the Warrior unit,
the pride of Marley,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:08.690
and captured two of their main weapons,
the Colossal and Female Titans.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:17.120
Marley's many enemies took notice
and were quick to unite and declare war.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.870
If you guys are secret agents
who infiltrated Marley,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.130
I'm guessing you came
from conquered nations?

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:34.220
Oh, I'm right?! If you're going up against
Marley, I bet you've got big backers!

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.850
We're not secret agents or anything of the sort.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.020
We were powerless. Marley took our
homes and forced us to be soldiers.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.780
We were close to losing hope
at ever striking back.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.240
Until we met him.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.950
A Titan that people of the
world feared, calling it a devil.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:03.080
But I saw something completely different...

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.550
A god. One that gave hope
to the powerless.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.970
Under Zeke Jaeger's command,
we shot our superiors.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:24.100
We're the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.
Our goal: To free the Eldian people.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.820
That concludes Zeke Jaeger's requests.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.740
For the sake of all Eldians
whose existence is threatened--

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.820
Absurd! I don't even want to hear it!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.870
He's the Beast Titan!

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.000
He turned the people of Ragako
into Titans and incited a panic!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.130
This is the same person who
nearly annihilated the Scouts!

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.840
His one and only goal is to
retake the Founding Titan.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.800
Since he can't do it by force,
he'll attempt it diplomatically.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.730
He should know we'll expect that.
Let's hear what else he has to say.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:09.230
According to Zeke, he has a secret
plan to solve the Eldian issue.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:15.780
To carry it out, it requires the Founding
Titan and a Titan with royal blood.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.820
With both, the world can be saved.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:24.450
However, he will only reveal the plan
when his conditions are met.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.580
Bullshit!

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.500
He must think we're idiots!

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.460
Eren?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.260
He's telling the truth. I remember...

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.300
The one time I was able to use
the Founding Titan's power

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.810
was when I touched a Titan with royal blood.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:49.230
That Titan had to be my father's
other wife, Dina Fritz.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:56.280
Zeke, Dina's son, must have figured out
a way to elude the vow renouncing war.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.870
The one single hope remaining for us Eldians:

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:08.000
To wake the millions of Titans sleeping
in the walls and activate the rumbling.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.420
You... Why did you keep quiet
about this for so long?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.670
I was concerned for Historia's safety.

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:22.890
I couldn't let her get made into a Titan
based on some hunch of mine.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.560
Yeah, it was careless of me.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.390
We'll talk about it later.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:33.320
But if that's really true,
Zeke's secret plan holds up.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.980
Are you nuts?! You trust them?!

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.110
Yeah! We can't have all those
soldiers on the island!

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.990
We oughta hang 'em all!

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.580
No, we can't do that.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:51.920
To protect the island from Marley's
scout ships, we need the volunteers.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.090
Without their "wireless radio"...

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.010
This is... fir... scout fleet. Request... aid.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.640
This is... first scout fleet.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.890
Second fleet. Go ahead.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:09.430
What a relief! Our ship ran aground!
We've been waiting for your help.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.810
We're on the way! In the cove, huh?

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.610
How many ships? Don't worry!
Two are headed your way!

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:19.940
Hey!

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.030
You okay?! We're coming to get you!

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.660
--It's the Colossal Titan!
--How?!

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.080
Hey! It's the enemy!

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.580
Hurry! Jump!

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.540
Run!

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.340
Jump off!

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.430
Welcome to the filthy island of
filthy devils. You're gonna love it.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.100
As long as you like pig piss.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.600
You can leave if you want, but not on a ship.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.270
Are you good at swimming?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.190
It was fun back then.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:05.530
Certainly, we Eldians are feared
and hated by the world.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.040
By people across the sea
whose faces we don't know.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:15.330
But not everyone across the sea
was our enemy.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:23.050
And we found out the world itself
was complex and full of unknowns.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.930
By the way, why do you have
dark skin, Onyankopon?

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:35.690
Because our creator thought, "It's more
interesting with a mix of people."

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:42.400
You Subjects of Ymir are the same.
We exist because we were wanted.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.820
Who created us?

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:51.290
The one who gave the
Founder Ymir power. God.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.710
That's what some people believe.
Aren't we free to think what we want?

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.010
What the hell is this food?

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.930
Is it even edible?

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.050
Smells fishy.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:12.140
You've never had seafood?
Nicolo's a master of Marleyan cooking.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:17.100
Jerks. If you don't like it, don't eat.
Eldians like you don't--

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.400
So good!

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.570
--Hey!
--No fair, Sasha!

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.290
Nicolo! You're a food genius!

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.870
S-Stop eating like a pig!

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.210
I've never had anything like this!

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.250
There's plenty, so take your time.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.220
The port will be finished soon!

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.770
Thanks to the Marleyan engineers,
building it's been quick.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:58.350
They've sure been cooperative.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:04.070
It went bad at first since
neither side trusted the other.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:10.870
But given enough time, if we set aside
our labels and see each other as people,

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.240
we can understand each other.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.120
Armin. Have you seen Bertholdt's memories?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.420
Huh? Yeah, but there's
nothing that seems helpful.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:28.220
There's not much time.
Zeke has less than three years left.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.180
Yeah, about that...

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.470
Do we really want to go along
with Yelena's plan?

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.180
What's the problem?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:43.570
Is using the rumbling to threaten the
world the only way to protect Eldians?

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.570
Then we <i>will</i> be the devils
that terrorize the world.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.820
Before it comes to that, can't we talk?

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:55.830
If we can fix Marley and the
world's misconception...

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.710
Misconception? What misconception?

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.380
You know, like how we're scary.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:09.720
The world sees us as monsters who can
turn into Titans. They're not wrong.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.640
There're Marleyans who like us, too.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.510
How many?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.640
Most of the Marleyans
are sitting in prison cells.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.350
But given enough time...

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.150
Yeah. We need time.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:32.410
That's right. And to buy us that time,
we've gotta keep 'em at bay.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.870
I wonder... did we make the right choice?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:52.300
I can't help but think:
Could there have been some other path?

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:58.930
I thought I understood Eren
better than anyone. Even Mikasa.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.060
But I don't know anymore.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.940
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Scout Fleet"
"Formed to investigate Paradis Island after the Operation to Retake the Founding Titan had failed. The first fleet embarked in 851. Over the following three approximately 4600 soldiers aboard a total
of 32 scout ships and destroyers were sent
to Paradis Island. However, not a single one has returned to Marley to this day." years,

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.080
Hey! Aren't you a Marleyan?!
What the hell are you doing here?!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.290
--This graveyard is full of people
your kind killed!

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.460
--Wait!
--This graveyard is full of people
your kind killed!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.710
Let us take care of this guy!

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.460
Sorry. Please.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.930
Marleyans can piss off!

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:34.930
Hey, Nicolo!

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.970
You okay?

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.180
Dammit! Why?!

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.730
Sasha's really dead?

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.270
Yeah.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.780
Why? What the hell were you guys doing?!

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:58.410
Shot by a kid who sneaked on the airship?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.330
It's too ridiculous to be true.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.830
It was no ordinary girl. She'd been trained.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:09.960
A Warrior candidate?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:14.050
I let my guard down. Sorry.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:19.720
Why apologize to me?
All I did was cook her food.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:28.520
Thanks for letting her eat
so much tasty food, Nicolo.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.650
What do you think about this, Conny?

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.450
Sasha and I were like twins.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.990
It feels like half of me is gone.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.160
You're...

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.370
Y'all knew my daughter, did ya?

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.510
U-Um...

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:04.470
I'm just a captive Marleyan,
but I'm allowed to work as a chef.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.480
Your daughter loved eating my
food more than anyone else.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:16.400
So... if you ever want to...
please come and eat my food.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.160
On the house, right?

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.790
Of course.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.260
You guys are calling it a victory.
Isn't ignorance a scary thing?

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.810
If I send your dead body to Marley
and reveal your little plot,

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.640
your gramps and granny are done for.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.900
But if this secret plan of yours is real,
I can wait to chop you up.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.650
Either way works for me.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:03.620
I appreciate your graciousness.
But don't I get to meet Eren first?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.620
Don't be in such a hurry.
We've got the finest hotel for you.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.330
You can stay there and relax a while.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:19.010
Hey... Can you please stop glaring at me?

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.720
This is all of the Titan serum
we stole from Marley.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.850
But you'll have trouble reproducing it.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.850
No, we should manage fine with this much.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:35.060
I only wish we could properly thank you.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:40.780
We owe you so much already.
We were ignorant, but you gave us hope.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.080
For us to suspect you,
we're truly no better than devils.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:52.330
For three years, we've done nothing
but show we're friends of the Eldians.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:20:00.380
It's unfortunate. The guns we brought
were meant to give Eldians freedom.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:07.220
I know it's selfish to ask, but can you
overlook our cautiousness for a while?

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.770
We have to keep Zeke on a tight leash.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:17.820
It's fine, Commander Pyxis.
We'll dine at the same table again soon.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.780
<i>This</i> is my hotel?

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.410
You got a problem with it?

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:29.660
It's a forest of giant trees.
I can't think of a better place for you.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.500
Might be lots of fun with ODM gear.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.590
Hey, Captain Levi. Think I could show
Gabi and Falco this natural wonder?

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.210
Tsk.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.300
Whether they see the sights
or not depends on you.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.650
Eren... Jaeger!

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.070
Eren would have done it alone.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:07.280
Whether we helped him or not,
the worst would've happened anyways.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.370
In any case, we killed a lot of people.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.410
The navy, army, and civilians
got dragged into it.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:19.920
And just like that, all were lost.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.300
But unless that port was destroyed,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:28.260
Marley would've retaliated
and attacked the island.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:34.060
We killed any hope for peace,
but we had no choice.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.190
Just like you guys that day.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.900
Hey, Annie...

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.900
Say something, please.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.030
Fight or die.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.910
Win... and live.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.550
The only way to win is to fight.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.840
Fight.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.550
Fight!

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.860
Without any allies on the outside,
they must kill their enemies to live.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:53.610
Is that the right choice or not?
There's not a soul who knows.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.470
Next episode: "A Sound Argument."
