00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.720
Everyone says Eren has changed.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.940
I believed that, too.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.390
But, maybe that wasn't true.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.900
Maybe Eren hasn't changed at all
from the beginning.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.770
If that's how Eren has always been...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.770
Then what part of Eren
I've been seeing all these years?

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.160
So there really are cities outside
the walls and people living in them.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.630
Don't say stuff about walls
in front of strangers, okay?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.600
Oh, yeah. Of course.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.630
So this is the continent beyond the walls.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490
And we're the first group of human from
within the walls to step foot outside!

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.620
I told you not to say that!

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.030
You could say this what
our job is really about.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.020
Let's begin the survey.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.010
(The Dawn of Humanity)

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.640
Everyone!

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.540
Welcome to the continent of Marley!

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.470
Allow me to show you to
Lady Azumabito's mansion.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.180
Onyankopon!

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.170
I'm so glad you guys made it!

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.300
What do you think?
This is Marley's biggest port city--

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.750
That horse... or is even a horse?

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.300
- Eh?
- Cow.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.130
It's a cow! It has to be some kind of cow!

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.480
It's a car.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380
We heard about them before
we came here, right?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.930
Hey! Car!

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.840
This is bad. People are staring at us.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.620
They must think we're
a group of bumpkins now.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.960
- Eh?
- Let's pretend we don't know them.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.650
- Hello! Car! Hey!
- Wait for us!

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.540
If you don't stop them, they'll start
feeding carrots to that lump of iron.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.560
You must be kidding--

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.490
They're buying carrots!

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.480
So many people.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.370
Hey, Eren. There's no telling
what'll happen, so stay close to me.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.810
Eren?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.620
Y-Yeah...

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.580
Quit spacing out, Eren!

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.250
We're in the outside world, aren't we?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.110
Yeah.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.500
This is the other side of the sea... right?

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.130
Hey, don't walk off too far.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.440
Especially you.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.130
We're coming!

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.530
Watch out, kid!

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.360
I'll take this, please.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.920
Thanks.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.030
Here you go.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.710
Hey, Sasha!
Don't go off buying stuff again!

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.630
This thing's cold!

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.940
Let me try that!

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.360
First time eating ice cream?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.990
Whoa! What's this?!

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.220
- This is delicious!
- I'll have one, too!

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.340
Me too!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.490
Just how many times have we told
them to keep a low profile...?

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.110
No one would thought they're
the "devils" from that island.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.280
Hey, guys! You should try this, too!

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.300
Hey there, kiddo.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.590
Would you like some sweet, tasty candy?

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.910
I'm talking to you.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.270
That's a cool look!

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.090
Are you kiddos playing gangster?

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.850
I smell something good over there!

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.560
It might be what Niccolo talked about!

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.220
Three more of those, please!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.250
Thank you.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.160
Eren!

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.610
You should try, too.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.920
Ice cream?

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.100
You knew?

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.450
From the old man's memory, that is.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.220
Eldians living in the internment zone
rarely get to eat one.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.160
Even though there are so many
things outside the walls.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.960
We didn't notice.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.200
Or perhaps, we refused to.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.360
Hey!

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.070
That isn't your purse.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.450
A pickpocket!

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.020
Another immigrant
from an enemy state?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.090
How did you get here?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.800
He must've snuck onto a ship!

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.530
Looks like he can't understand us.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.350
How about we toss him into the sea?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.600
Nah, let's just smash his right hand.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.940
That'll stop him from stealing again.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.380
Let's tie him up somewhere in the open
for a while so everyone can see.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.430
Surely that'll teach the others
to quit stealing.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.890
Hold up! That's going to far!

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.190
I already got my purse back.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.600
This isn't your problem, Missy.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.030
We must punish him to set an example.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.480
It's a problem for all of us merchants
making a living here.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.240
Not only that, he might even be
a Subject of Ymir.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.780
This is why countries around the world
have been frantic with blood tests for years.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.200
Nobody could sleep at night knowing
these devil blood lurking around nearby.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.780
Hey! What are you doing?

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.790
Who said he was a pickpocket?

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.970
I only said it wasn't his purse.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.430
The purse is his older sister's.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.310
Yeah, they've got a really complicated
family situation, you know?

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.540
Isn't that right, Sis?

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.090
Yeah!

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.850
I'm sorry about my little brother!

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.790
You really expect us to buy that?!

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.860
Let's go!

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.060
Hey! Wait!

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.920
Where did that brat go?

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.630
Ah, over there.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.360
Well, that's just the money
I got from the Azumabitos, anyway.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.510
I'm sorry you went through that.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.390
It is true that as blood testing
technology has improved,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.280
Subjects of Ymir who escaped the interment
are being discovered around the world,

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.240
and it became an issue.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.830
At the height of the Eldian Empire,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.590
having a Subject of Ymir in one's bloodline
was widely considered

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.130
to be the proof of one's nobility.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.010
But as the Empire crumbled,
those people were forced into exile.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.550
This is what Eldians outside
of the walls are facing.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.840
Also, it makes the plan for
Paradis island to advocate harmony

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.340
become extremely
difficult to be executed.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.450
But if we were to abandon
the path of peace,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.820
we'll have no option but to
ride on Zeke's conspiracy.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.000
We'll have to put our fates in his hand...

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.280
and sacrifice Historia as well as
the children she'd give birth to...

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.860
Yeah.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.760
Of course, we're here to avoid
that future from happening.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.800
We'll attend the international forum
tomorrow for the unveiling

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.150
of the Association to Protect
the Subjects of Ymir.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.180
Like before, we still don't know exactly
what this association stands for.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.460
Yes. For now, we'll need to carefully
observe them from afar.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.220
And if that association shares
the same value as us...

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.800
You'll go and tell them
that Paradis seeks peace.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:52.020
Yes.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.810
It goes without saying that the Azumabito clan
wishes to help bring this peace as well.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:06.070
But just how realistic
do you believe this plan to be?

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.220
We understand how difficult it is.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.720
And how dangerous, as well.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:20.730
But even with that in mind,
all we can do here is to try our best.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.110
Very well.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.970
Where's Eren?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.630
Eren!

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.240
You do realize that you're
our enemies' biggest target, right?

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.820
Everyone has been
looking all over for you!

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.880
The boy from the market?

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.470
What happened?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.320
Nothing yet.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.490
Eh? What do you mean?

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.440
What's this place?

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.980
After the war left them with no home,
they all gathered here to live.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.710
They're just like us.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.280
One day, their regular lives just ended,
and everything was taken away from them.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.940
They were deprived of all their freedoms.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.060
Mikasa.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.330
Why do you care so much about me?

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.870
Eh?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.300
Is it because I saved you
when we were little?

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.560
Or is it because I'm your family?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.340
Eh? Huh?

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.240
What am I to you?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.980
You...

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.780
You are...

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.170
You're family.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.870
Eh?

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.020
(Please come with us inside.)

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.120
Huh?

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.870
They seem to be welcoming us.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.520
Hey!

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:26.530
What the hell are you doing, Eren!

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.350
You moron!

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.930
Perfect timing.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.250
(Enjoy!)

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:03.510
We seek aid for the displaced Subjects of Ymir
refugees who are scattered across nations!

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.580
These refugees were never once Eldians,

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.370
nor do they have anything with
the dangerous ideologies of the Eldian Empire!

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.910
They're nothing more than sad victims,
forced by the Eldian empire to inbreed!

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.980
It is none other than the devils
of that island that deserves our hatred!

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.650
The devils who escaped to that island
100 years ago are the ones we must abhor!

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:32.370
Our enemies are those island devils!

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.720
That was the day Eren left us.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.460
On the letter we later
received from him,

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.470
he said he would entrust
everything to Zeke.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.460
And the next time we met,
everything was already too late.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:06.940
I wonder if there was any other choice
we could have made.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.890
Maybe everything has been
decided from the very beginning.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.950
But I still can't help but to think.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.200
What if, on that day...

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.100
I chose another answer?

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.720
Then maybe things would've
turned out differently.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.010
I wonder where it all started.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.180
Back there?

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.020
No...

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.080
The place doesn't matter at all.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.740
It was all what I wanted.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.460
Everything is still ahead.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:12.720
Eren, the only way to save both the world
and Eldia is the Euthanization plan.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:15.480
Seeing this through is the only way.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.450
I've distributed the wines
injected with spinal fluid

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.520
to the military's top brass
who'd hinder our reforms.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.240
Zeke trusts you.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.640
So please trust Zeke.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.200
I'll pretend to follow Zeke's plan.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.110
You should do so, too.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.400
What will you do by doing that?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.910
The Military Police is planning
to turn you into a Titan

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.300
and feed Zeke to you
once he's on the island.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.780
Our only options are to fight
the Military Police or to run away.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.520
It's not like I've only been tending
to cattle all this time.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.350
I know.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.250
There's no need to fight or to run.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:09.000
Whatever the most reliable way
to ensure this island's survival is,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.780
I'll go along with it.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.740
There was no other way.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:22.400
But, back then, you stood up for me.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.360
Everyone helped.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.670
That's enough for me.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.000
That might be good for you,
but not for me.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.040
Eh?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.460
I'll destroy the world.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.920
I'll wipe out all my enemies
from this world.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.430
Until not a single one of them remain.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.430
You're making a mistake!

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.560
Not everyone outside are our enemies!

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.880
Most of them will be like your mother!

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.870
They'll die not even knowing
why it happens!

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.250
I know, but...

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:07.270
The only way to completely end
the cycle of revenge born from hate

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:11.890
is to completely bury that history
along with the civilization that created it.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.880
They want you to birth a child
to sacrifice for this island

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.170
and keep forcing children
to eat their parents.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.840
I won't let them.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.980
Eren, if I don't do everything
I can to stop you...

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:40.060
...I won't be able to live a life
I can be proud of anymore.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.520
If you can't take it,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.190
I can manipulate your memory
with the power the Founding.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.110
You just have to keep quiet until--

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.410
I can't do that!

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.570
You can.

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.370
You saved me back then.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.130
You're the baddest girl in the world.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.740
Headache?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.270
A disease unique to the Ackerman clan?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.250
I've never heard that from
the Titan research or Mr. Ksaver.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.190
Records do show Ackermans
often awaken their power

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.220
when their survival instincts are triggered.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.240
But an ingrained behaviour
to protect their "host"?

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.260
I'm pretty sure there's no such thing.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.000
From how I see it,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.430
Eren, there's no secret reason,
ingrained behaviour,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:35.030
or compelled instinct behind it.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:42.100
She just simply likes you so much
that she'd snap a Titan's neck for you.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.230
Then, Eren...

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.800
So, how will you respond?

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.230
What are you talking about, Brother?

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.350
I only have four years left to live at most.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.540
What about me having a child?

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:19.950
Even after I die,
their lives will still continue.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.750
I want them to.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.220
So they can...

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.570
...live a long, happy life.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.700
The global allied fleet.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:03.570
Nearly all of the largest cannons
that exist on this planet

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.460
have been gathered here,
in one place.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.620
Every bit of human brainpower now
has its sights fixed on the same target.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.980
It took a miracle to assemble this fleet,
and if we fail...

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.480
then humanity has nothing on
this world that could stop this.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.770
This Rumbling.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.010
That is...

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.340
Yeah, it's him.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.610
The Attacking Titan!

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.360
I'll exterminate them.

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.330
I will wipe them off from this world...

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.880
...until none of them remain!

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.130
