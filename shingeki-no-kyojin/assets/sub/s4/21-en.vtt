00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.680
Why won't you show me everything?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.230
The wall being destroyed...
The day it happens...

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.270
If Carla is safe...

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.530
Was this really the only way?

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.410
You're there, aren't you, Zeke?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.620
From here on, things won't go your way.
Only Eren will get what he wants.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.870
What... did you say?

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.380
I saw Eren's memories of what comes next.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.300
But I never imagined
it would be so terrible.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.100
Zeke...?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.470
Is that you?!

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.390
How you've grown!

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.270
I'm sorry... I was a terrible father.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.030
The things I put you through
were so cruel.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.620
Zeke... I love you.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.460
If only I had spent more time with you...

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.190
Father...

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.730
Zeke...

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.650
Please, stop Eren.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.670
We still haven't seen
the part where I eat him.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:01.430
Did you... push Father into fighting
the King of the walls... and the world?

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.770
If the Attack Titan really has
the power to transcend time,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.730
you could show him just the memories
which suited you to alter the past.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.360
Father... Grisha hesitated to
carry out his Restorationist mission.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.040
He knew he couldn't use the Founding
Titan's power, even if he stole it.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.540
Except he did steal it--
and entrusted it to you.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.460
Because of what he'd
seen in the future.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.550
Something in the future--
something you showed him.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.470
I'm grateful, Brother.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.980
This was only possible because you
brought me into Dad's memories.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.730
He said things wouldn't go my way--
that only you would get what you want.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.940
Yeah. I saw it four years ago:

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.820
I saw my own future
through Dad's memories.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.200
What a sight it was.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.500
Founder Ymir! Make Eldians unable
to reproduce anymore!

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.800
The Coordinate...!

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.440
Grisha told me, "Please, stop Eren."

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.110
He regretted listening to you.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.910
I don't know what sort of future
you saw through Father's memories,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.660
but you didn't see everything, right?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.830
For example, you didn't know you
couldn't use the Founder's power here.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.130
You're as powerless as ever.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.100
It's no use, Eren.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.980
Once Ymir has begun to move...

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.330
...no one in this world can stop her.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.960
"From You, 2,000 Years Ago"

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.350
You're amazing, Historia!
Look at how well you can read now!

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.890
That's only because you
taught me so much!

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.230
Hey, we can't have this.
You've got a runny nose.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:29.150
You need to learn to be more
ladylike, Historia. Here, blow.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.320
Ooh!

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.830
Good! Very well done!

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.870
Hey?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.370
Hmm?

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.370
What does being ladylike mean?

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:51.760
Well... I suppose being ladylike means...
being a lot like this girl right here.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.550
You like her, too, don't you?

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.140
Yeah.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.640
She's always thinking about other
people because she's so kind.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.020
The world is full of pain and suffering...

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.650
...so you should live in a way...

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.170
...to be helpful and loved by everybody.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.300
One of you let a pig escape.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.140
If nobody fesses up,
every one of you loses an eye.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.980
Slaves have no need for two.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.320
You're the one who let it escape?

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.430
Very well. You are "free."

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.150
You've done well, my slave, Ymir.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.910
You've built roads, cultivated the wilds,
and bridged mountains.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:35.120
My tribe, Eldia, has grown quite large.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.210
As a reward, I shall give you my seed.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:48.600
In the name of Fritz,
annihilate the vile people of Marley!

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.490
What are you doing? Get up.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:41.000
I know you won't die
from a mere spear, my slave, Ymir.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:03.940
Feast, my daughters! Whatever it takes,
Ymir's power must be carried on!

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:12.780
Eat every last piece of Ymir's body,
Maria... Rose... Sina!

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.500
My daughters...
Bear children and multiply.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.090
Ymir's blood must be passed on.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:32.220
If my daughters die, feed their
spines to my grandchildren.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.640
If they die, feed their spines
from child to child!

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:29.150
Even after I pass, Eldia will dominate
the lands with its monstrosities,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.860
and our Titans shall reign
supreme for eternity!

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.660
Until the world's end! For etern--

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.120
I'll end it!

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.370
I'll put an end to this world!
Give me your strength!

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.460
You're not a slave! You're not a god!
You're just a person!

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.130
You don't have to bow to anyone!
You can decide!

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.430
It's your choice! You get to choose!

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.390
--Do you wanna stay here for eternity
or should I end this?!

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.970
--Eren? Stop it!
--Do you wanna stay here for eternity
or should I end this?!

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.980
What's the big idea?!
What are you doing?!

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.690
Ymir! Obey my command!

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.810
--I said, "Make Eldians unable to reproduce!"

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.150
--Were you the one who led me here?
--I said, "Make Eldians unable to reproduce!"

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.450
Do it now, Ymir!

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.280
You've been waiting this whole time.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.790
I'm a descendant of royal blood!

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:27.120
For 2,000 years... For someone.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.100
Wha--?!

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.140
Gabi!

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:13.940
Information Available for Public Disclosure
The Origin of Titans
According to legend, the Founder Ymir obtained the Power of the Titans when coming into contact with 'something.' For generations, her blood and power were passed down by the Eldians. However, the identity of that 'something' which began it all remains unknown. It may have been some type of pathogenic parasite, a god who pitied the Founder Ymir and gave her power, or something else entirely.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.130
What is that? It's enormous...

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:46.310
It looked like it appeared from
where Eren was. That's...

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.560
He did it! Eren did it!

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.640
Speak up!

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.400
--We won!
--Huh?!

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.730
Eren has control of the Founder!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:00.990
If the rumbling has begun,
Eren's the one behind it!

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.330
He's gonna crush the global alliance
assembling in Marley!

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.410
Eren's our ally! He's always been!

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.840
Zeke...

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:30.850
Eren came home... to be with us?

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.940
You're kidding! That's odd...
No, it can't be...!

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.230
Mikasa!

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.650
Even Wall Maria has come down!

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.780
If he's just crushing the global
alliance, what's the point?!

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:53.830
Shiganshina's wall should be plenty!
Why give up the walls to attack?!

00:20:53.830 --> 00:21:00.630
If he's just crushing the alliance
in Marley, why use so many--?!

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.090
Hear me, Subjects of Ymir.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:09.390
I heard Eren's voice!

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.890
My name is Eren Jaeger.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:19.770
I'm using the Founding Titan's power
to address all Subjects of Ymir.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.860
I've undone the hardening
of Paradis Island's walls

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:29.200
and the Titans buried within
have begun their march.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:37.080
My goal is to protect the people
of Paradis Island--the place I was born.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:45.510
However, the world wants to exterminate
my people--and not just on the island.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:50.760
They will not stop until every last
Subject of Ymir is dead.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.270
I refuse to let them.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:01.520
The Wall Titans will trample every inch
of the world beyond this island

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:07.990
until every last life beyond
our shores is wiped out.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:46.460
The ground shakes and rumbles.
A cloud of dust reaches the sky.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:53.050
A horde of Titans marches ahead.
The island's walls are gone.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.970
"Thaw"

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.970
Next episode: "Thaw."
