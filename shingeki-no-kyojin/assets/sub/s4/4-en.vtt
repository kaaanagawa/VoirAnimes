00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.600
Falco? Where are you headed this late?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.110
I forgot something at HQ,
so I'm going back to get it.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.780
See you later!

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.450
Falco, could you do me a favor?

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.710
What's that, Mr. Kruger?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.330
I want to send a letter, but...

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.090
...if it's sent from the internment zone,
they'll check it.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550
That's right.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.850
They might find out I'm not really sick,
so could you send it from outside?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.350
Sure thing. Is it to your family?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.900
Yeah. I wanna tell 'em I'm here
and doing just fine.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.000
"From One Hand to Another"

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.130
Hey, why all the commotion?

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.170
The whole Tybur family has come to visit!

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.010
Excuse me?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.980
It's the Tyburs' personal guard.
They're not part of our military.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.520
Come in.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.280
Sorry to drop in on you.
I'm Willy, the head of the Tybur family.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.570
Commander of the Warrior unit, Theo Magath.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.160
It's an honor to meet you, Lord Tybur.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.290
Nice to meet you, Commander Magath.
Allow me to introduce you to the family.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.720
Having managed the Warrior unit
from the outset,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.430
are you able to tell which of us
is the War Hammer Titan?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.810
No, I haven't a clue.
One might wonder if it's even here at all.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.150
You're very astute, just like I've heard.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.530
But it's here.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.570
The War Hammer Titan is among us.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.750
I came here to see the statue of Helos.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.040
A century ago, a mere human
slayed the devil of all earth

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.880
and became the renowned Marleyan
hero who saved the world--Helos.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.300
How marvelous. So brave and
beautiful, with not a scratch.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.520
Truly, the spirit of Marley.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.480
The spirit, indeed.
For within, it's empty inside.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.530
You're a tough critic, Commander.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.900
I hear you're working to reinstate
Marleyan conscription?

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.870
War, for Marleyans,
exists solely inside their newspapers.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.250
They're content to just read
about our lands expanding.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.000
If our tamed devils or conquered armies
are eating the bullets, all the better.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.010
One hopes letting Marleyans hear the
sound of bullets whizzing by their ears

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.390
will be enough to stop our
self-destructive march towards war.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.600
If someone controlled Marley
from the shadows, I'd tell them:

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.230
It's already too late.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.110
You truly don't hold back,
Commander. What can I say?

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.990
As you noted, this nation is
controlled by the Tyburs.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.040
But this path of warmongering
was one that Marley chose on its own.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.300
We gave Marley both freedom
and power in hopes of atonement.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.220
But in the end, Eldia and Marley
were thrown into darkness.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.260
The Tyburs are responsible for that.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.770
I intend to reveal the truth to the world
at the upcoming festival.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.570
My coming to see the statue was no lie.
Marley is in need of a hero once more.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.240
Theo Magath... Will you not join hands with me?

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.120
Huh?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.330
Morning, Pock!

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.210
Pieck! What are you doing?!

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.430
This way's more natural to me. Did I scare you?

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.930
Can you just walk upright?

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.260
Titans come from the south.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.560
The wall will be less defended the closer
you get to these mountains up north.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.230
Then, we should attack from the north?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.150
That's one option.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.910
However, the wharf is the only place
where our large ships can dock.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.870
We could press our advantage.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.830
So, the south?

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.540
But the south is where
our scout ships were lost.

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.500
It's where they're most focused.
The wharf might even be destroyed.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.130
So, what are you trying to say?

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.880
I'm merely trying to share
the information I gathered.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.760
All right, enough.
It was dumb to let an Eldian talk.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.980
The Paradis Island planning is going just swell.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.730
The brass in charge is oh so intelligent.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.860
Can't wait to hear what they come up with.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.200
Like entrusting the whole thing to four kids?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.370
Hmm?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.500
He's ahead. Falco passed up Gabi!

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.640
Look at 'em celebrate one little win.
Jeez. They've got no idea.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:41.390
No matter how well Falco does
at this point, he'll never surpass Gabi.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.980
Did you see him take off at the end?!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.860
Hey, runts. What's the big deal?

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.230
Falco finally beat Gabi!

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.200
In grades?! Really?!

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.700
No, just in a race!

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.910
This is a historic feat!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.240
Can you cut it out? You're embarrassing me.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.790
That's pretty awesome!
Maybe you'll be the next Armor!

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.790
Ow!

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.210
It's way too late to compete against me!

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:13.880
I made our motherland proud in the war!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.100
I know.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.060
But they still haven't announced
a successor yet.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.190
Until then, I'll do everything I can.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.320
Man, talk about showing off.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.610
Your brother's already inheriting the Beast!
You'll be an Honorary Marleyan!

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.530
What's the point of trying so hard?!

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.830
I'm doing it for you!

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.920
Whoa...

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.540
He totally said it!

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.640
Huh?! You're getting in my way,
but you're doing it for me?

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.890
That doesn't make any damn sense!

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.220
Guess it didn't get through.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.980
Huh?! What's his problem?! What gives?!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.650
Oh! Welcome back, our little Warriors!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:18.910
Gabi! I heard what you did, Gabi!
You're our savior, Gabi!

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.450
Well, I'm Zofia, so...

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.290
Huh?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.960
What's wrong with you?! Quit day drinking
and grabbing girls, you geezer!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.590
Shuddap, you nincompoop!
What's wrong with praising a hero?!

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.010
If anything, being praised by you is bad luck!

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:40.600
Go on! Stumble back home to your mom!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.970
Now then, I've got a treat for you kids!

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.650
Eat up and grow big like Vice Chief Braun!

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.730
Thank you!

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.650
Whoa!

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.700
Will they really declare war
right here in the zone?

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.700
Reminds me of a theater.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.450
I heard they're inviting VIPs here

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.880
and after doing this festival,
the world will be on our side.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.210
Fantastic!

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.090
All of Marley's problems will magically go away!

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.220
You think it won't work?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.260
You actually do?

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:26.270
The Mid-East Forces we were
just slaughtering will be there.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:33.190
My family came from an internment zone
abroad, so I know how awful it is.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.150
The hate for Eldians abroad
makes here seem like nothing.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.410
Well, all the more reason
we've gotta try something.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.830
They might've chosen to hold it here
so people understand us!

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.910
We can show 'em we're not devils!

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.460
But how?

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.670
Smile!

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.590
I know you can't wait to show the world
they're wrong, but stop looking so smug.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.180
And, Zofia... Cut it out with your weird act.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.640
Um, this is who I am...

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.770
Fine! So what are you gonna fix?!

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.150
Huh? There's no need, 'cuz I'm perfect as-is!

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.610
I'm smart and cute as a button!

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:19.030
And when I captivate all the VIPs,
it'll secure my spot even more!

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.700
I think I spot a devil.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.830
If you guys cheer for Falco again,
I'll make you cry!

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.250
You really are a devil!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.580
It's Commander Magath.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.130
Here.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.970
Oh? A large-scale demolition is required?

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.180
It has decayed beyond repair.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.560
Congratulations, General. The military is yours.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:12:01.280
No. The military serves the nation,
and this nation's supreme commander is you.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.740
That's not quite true.
I'm simply the one who holds the wheel.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.830
Now I know why my
predecessors never tried to grab it.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.580
It's so heavy.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:21.550
I wish I could let go this very moment,
but a time has come where I must not.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.050
It just happened to be me.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.720
I'm simply the man
this responsibility fell upon.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.480
The house was in danger of collapsing,
but some pillars remained usable.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.360
According to them, the house
is already infested with rats.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.490
Nice work, Falco.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.070
It's all thanks to you, Kruger!

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.870
But at this point, I honestly doubt
I can pass up Gabi.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.540
Even so, I'm gonna keep moving forward.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.380
I see. I'm the one who should be
thanking you, though.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:06.050
I'm grateful you've been sending
all my letters. You've been a big help.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.600
Yeah...

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.140
Did your family send you that?

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.020
They thought it'd make
hospital life less boring.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.440
Hard to do much in this shape, though.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.980
I need to move forward, too.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.320
When the festival's over,
I'm going back to my hometown.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.330
I see.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.450
A doctor's coming.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.120
I'll get going!

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.460
Yeah.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.920
May I sit next to you?

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.500
Yeah, sure.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.010
I appreciate it.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:54.350
I'm Jaeger, a physician for the zone.
I come here to drink tea sometimes.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.730
Nice to meet you. I'm Kruger.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:03.730
Nice to meet you, Kruger.
You seem to get along with that boy.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.530
Yeah.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.740
I see. I think I could get along with him, too.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:14.290
I sit here on this bench looking
for people to talk to.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.170
His uncle was a leader of
the Eldian Restorationists.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:24.960
Restorationists are sent to paradise
and not even their family is spared.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.010
To protect their family,
he and his brother trained to be Warriors,

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.640
and when his brother was chosen
to inherit the Beast Titan,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.440
the Grice family knew they were finally safe.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.480
Why are you telling me this?

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.320
Stop asking the boy to do favors for you.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.240
If he comes under suspicion, all their
effort will have been for nothing.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.910
And if you're truly healthy,
you should go back to your family.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:06.420
Someday, you won't see them anymore.
Don't wait and live with regret.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.340
Regret, huh?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.310
You have regrets about your own family?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.060
There's not a day that I don't.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.570
That day, my son took
my daughter outside the walls.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:31.410
It's because I was too strict
about him becoming a doctor!

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.120
It's my fault! Everything was my fault!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.050
Mr. Jaeger! Please don't go around on your own!

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.300
I'm so sorry. I looked away for a second.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.550
This way, Mr. Jaeger.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.930
Everything will be okay.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.940
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Tybur Family"
"A family of nobles that revolted against
 Eldia in the Great Titan War 100 years ago. They joined hands with the Marleyan hero Helos to <b>overcome the Eldian Empire and bring an end to the war. As nobles who have long possessed the War Hammer Titan, they have guided Marley
for many years and hold significant influence
both domestically and abroad. Currently, Currently, Willy Tybur is the head of the family."</b>

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.660
Whoa!

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.910
I've seen them in the paper!

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:21.750
Cut the chitchat.
We've gotta be waiters like we trained.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.000
Look, there's empty glasses! Get 'em!

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.720
--Falco, drink!
--Here!

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:42.020
Hmm? Oh... There's filthy blood
touching the plates.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.520
Ugh! That explains why the food stinks!

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.400
I-I'm terribly sorry!

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.610
Shh! Don't make a fuss.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.620
B-But your fancy clothes--!

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.910
Is everything all right, madam?

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:02.710
How embarrassing!

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.250
I spilled wine on my kimono
and was asking for help!

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:08.420
Thank you.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.920
I'm sorry to hear that.
Please, come this way.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.340
Wh-Why?

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:17.930
Who knows what would've happened to you.

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.350
You okay?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.810
Yeah... She saved me.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.060
She knew I was an Eldian.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.400
That woman... I think she's
an Easterner from Hizuru.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.820
It's Willy!

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.040
Willy! Kin of our saviors!

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.330
Ambassador Ogweno! Long time no see!

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.420
Nambia! We were kids last time I saw you!

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.840
I used to make you cry all the time!

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.920
Remember this, Willy?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.720
Oh! From the time you fell out of the tree!

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:09.560
Ladies and Gentlemen!
We thank you all for coming tonight!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:15.990
Until recently, we were squabbling
over resources in an unsightly war.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.530
However, yesterday's enemy is today's enemy!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.870
Pardon me. Yesterday's enemy is today's friend!

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.960
Let's wash the past
down the toilet with our drinks!

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.670
Please raise your glasses
and join me for a toast!

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.090
To everlasting peace!

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.140
Thank you very much! Such an elegant
joke to amuse our guests!

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.390
--Huh?
--But I'm afraid our guests

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.810
didn't quite understand,
so allow me to take over.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.190
Yeah, Willy!

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.520
Kin of our saviors!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.870
Tomorrow, I invite all of you
to the Liberio Internment Zone.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:07.370
It is the home of a people
whose blood runs through me.

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:14.090
The ones called devils for slaughtering
a great number of people--the Eldians.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.340
Though once repressed more greatly than any,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:23.100
Marley has used the devils to oppress
other nations and repeat the tragedy.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.470
I understand the desire
to exterminate the Eldians.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:34.060
But I have arrived at a single solution
that will answer this endless problem.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:41.410
Tomorrow, I will reveal that solution
in my first-ever theater production.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.280
To the great playwrights
and witnesses of history!

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.580
To the playwrights and witnesses of history!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.180
What the--?!

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.070
What in the world?!

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.690
Gabi! You're finally up!

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.150
What's happening?!

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:23.490
The festival!

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:28.450
People from outside came pouring in
and opened all these stalls!

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.830
Try this!

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.750
<i>This</i> is a festival?!

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.250
Let's go!

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.070
It hurts!

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.490
'Cuz you stuffed your face.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.080
I wish we had festivals every day! Blech!

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.370
Yeah.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:18.590
Lately, it seems like lots of new
things have been happening.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.340
It does.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:25.680
It kinda feels like something
is about to change!

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.640
Yeah.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.260
It does.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.500
Oh? Did you guys have fun?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
Huh? Where's Falco?

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.630
He said he saw someone he knew and ran off.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:46.170
Really? What's the matter with him?

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.880
Can't you just loosen up for a day?

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.550
So many people...

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.060
Huh? Looks like he's back.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.100
Mr. Braun!

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.810
Where the hell did you go?

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.600
Can you come with me?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.940
Right now?

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.610
You'll be fine. It shouldn't start for a bit.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.070
This way!

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.240
What's this all about?

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.660
You'll see soon enough!

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.910
In here!

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.370
Okay.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.500
I brought him!

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.880
Hey. It's been four years, Reiner.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.220
Eren!

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:44.150
In a dusky cellar, Reiner confronts Eren.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:49.400
As the crowd is absorbed
by Willy's speech, Eren admits:

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.370
"I'm the same as you."

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "Declaration of War."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Declaration of War"
