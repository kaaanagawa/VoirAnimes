00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.630
Well, your father needs to get going.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.420
Be good kids and listen to your big sister.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.670
--Where are you going?
--Don't leave!

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.090
--Bring me something!
--I wanna go, too!

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.680
--No fair!
--Let me come with you!
--Pretty please!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.430
Sorry. I'm afraid not this time.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.230
--Huh? How come?
--It's not fair!

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.650
Behave, you guys! Don't be selfish!
You're making it hard for him!

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.320
Fine... Make sure all the kids get along.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.240
Yup! Good luck with your work!

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.000
Thanks. I think it's time I head out.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.370
--Take care!
--Bring me something!

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.120
Darling...

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.880
I'm sorry. Take care of the kids.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.720
Let's go.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.860
I suppose if I'm attacked,
it'll be during the speech?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.400
I can't say for sure,
but that seems the most likely.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.370
Only then will most of our brass
be gathered in one spot.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.830
However, it's protocol to make escape
plans at the last moment for security.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.960
Naturally, VIPs will use carriages.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.630
Let's sit them at the
"special seats" on the edge.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.260
Clump them together as much as possible.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.720
Are you sure about this?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.390
Compared to our predecessors,
the Tyburs haven't been playing around.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.310
We've been building relations
with the world's elite,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:55.110
improving the reputation of Eldians,
and watching Paradis Island's movements.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.070
But we should've been watching
our own backyard.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.200
Before we knew it, we had enemies
crossing the sea and at our necks.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.540
At this point, they might get
sliced at any moment.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.170
It's the conspirators working with
Paradis who I fear most.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.720
We still don't know who they are.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.510
As you know, our motherland
Marley has many enemies.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.010
Some, in our own military.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.190
We'll smoke them out
by lighting a fire under their asses.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.270
We can plan for their attack
and use it to our advantage.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.360
Unless you have a better idea,
we proceed as planned.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.660
Even if they take the bait,
we lose way too much.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.540
We'll sacrifice incompetent officers.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.460
If the enemy's goal is to damage
Marley's military, it works perfectly.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.300
When you rebuild the military, the party
will approve whomever you choose.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.260
But so many will die.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
Most of them will be Eldians!
They're spawn of the devil!

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.610
Don't change on me now, Commander Magath.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.490
You've sent countless Eldians marching
into machine guns and land mines.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.280
Why does it matter whether
they wear uniforms or not?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.490
Just keep doing what you've always done.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.670
Let me say one thing:

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:39.010
This isn't war. We don't know the enemy,
their goal, or how they'll attack.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.140
Plus, the venue will be packed
with a huge crowd.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.180
Lord Tybur, I doubt I'll be able to protect you.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.730
If we proceed, you will die.
They won't pass you up as bait.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.160
Of course. I'm prepared for that.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.790
Unless I stand on stage,
the world will not take notice.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.210
The military, newspapers, and
ambassadors won't gather in one place.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.420
Above all, the Eldians of the internment
zone and I must be made tragic victims.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.550
Victims of an "unforeseen attack."

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.270
If I am the sole survivor,
the world will not become our ally.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.360
There's no doubt that Eldians
are spawn of the devil.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.240
And there's no doubt
that we are devils ourselves.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.990
"The War Hammer Titan"

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.010
Get up, Gabi! Udo!

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.050
Stand up! Hurry!

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.890
Zofia?

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.020
--Zofia!
--Udo, don't!

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.860
--Zofia!
--Udo, get back!

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.900
Hurry! We gotta lift this!

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.240
Udo!

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.890
Brother... You fulfilled the
Tyburs' duty admirably.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.170
Commander! The War Hammer is getting wrecked!

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.640
Commander! The Warriors are missing!

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.090
Captain Calvi and the brass are dead!

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.920
We should check for survivors!

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.840
It's dangerous here!

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.840
We need orders!

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.340
Commander!

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.010
Commander?

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:42.980
It's a useless plink, but this signals
the beginning of Marley's counterattack.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.190
To think they'd make such a grand entrance.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:53.190
What's more, it looks to be the usurper
of the Founding Titan--the Attack Titan.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.320
Eren Jaeger has come in person!

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.660
Saves us a trip to the island.
Get in position! Prepare for battle!

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.370
Yes, sir!

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.350
Hey, what's all the ruckus about?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.310
What are you doing?! We have to get out--

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.620
Remember it, people.
I'm the one who took the first shot.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.330
Shit! What the hell?! It's a battlefield now!

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.460
Colt! How's Udo?!

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.460
Not good. He needs the hospital.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.510
Udo! You're kidding!

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:03.140
Shit! Falco! Where are you?!

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.850
What's happening out there?!

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.230
By these tremors, I'd guess Titans are fighting.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.400
Are you serious?!

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.110
Us being trapped down here
is answer enough.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.070
We've gotta get out somehow.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.580
How?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.240
What the hell?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.250
You're late!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.090
Pieck!

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.040
You okay?!

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.750
Throw us a rope!

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.750
Got it!

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.630
The Panzer Unit? How'd they know?

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.340
I told 'em to follow since Beardy was shady.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.050
Back then?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.470
This soldier seems shady. Follow behind us.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.060
A Titan attacked during the speech!

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.060
For real?!

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.980
The War Hammer is fending it off!

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.600
Where's the Cart's gear?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.310
At HQ! We'll have it done in 15!

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.360
Make it 10!

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.280
Roger!

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.610
I'm going ahead.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.110
Wait, Porco. Before you rush in...

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.780
What the--?!

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.410
You're kidding... There's no way!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.030
Yeah, it hit!

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.370
Anti-Titan artillery packs a punch!

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.250
Reload!

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.710
Commander Magath,
let's finish off Eren Jaeger!

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.590
Without the Founding Titan, they're doomed!

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.230
No.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.010
Huh?

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.470
Killing the Founding Titan
only postpones the problem.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:09.310
We need to have the War Hammer eat it!
We're here to ensure that happens!

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.940
B-But, Commander...

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.860
I don't think the War Hammer
is trying to eat it.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.700
The War Hammer's a monster!

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.410
It beat the Attack Titan!

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.660
The War Hammer wins!

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.460
So that's Eren Jaeger, huh?

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.930
It's really gonna finish him off!

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.350
Usurper, Eren Jaeger.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.530
Do you have any last words?

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.290
Now or never, Mikasa.

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.830
You guys actually came.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.710
Eren, please...

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.500
Come home.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The War Hammer Titan"
"The Titan inherited by the Tybur family and held by Willy's younger sister, Lara Tybur. Its body is encased in a white shell created by its extraordinary hardening abilty.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.960
Furthermore, it can use that same hardening
ability to construct any weapon it envisions.
Its war hammer, crossbow, and whip are just a few examples from its arsenal of Titan-sized weaponry it wields to fight."

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.510
With the chain of command broken,
our military will be put to the test!

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.600
Call down all our troops doing
special training in the mountains!

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.020
Bring the fleet, too! Converge on top
of 'em with 30,000 soldiers!

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.400
I want Liberio surrounded!

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.240
Don't let the Founding Titan
or a single island devil escape!

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:36.790
Have fun while it lasts.
There's no future for you now.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:42.960
With this massacre, you just ensured
every major nation gets involved now.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:49.050
The world will see the Eldian Empire
as a threat, just like Willy planned.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.470
Now, no one's gonna let you live.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:58.020
But even they must've
known that going into this.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.940
Which means...

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.400
You damn devils!

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.490
Shoot 'em down!

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.040
Those morons!

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.960
Hey! You gonna burn the whole zone down?!

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.260
What part of keeping civilian casualties
to a minimum don't you get, Floch?!

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.140
The only thing here are enemies
and places they live!

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.310
Did you forget how they massacred
humanity inside the walls?!

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:41.060
We were eaten alive, dammit!
They've got it coming!

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.020
You're still saying that?

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:47.780
Look. Eren's telling us something--to fight!

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.280
We shouldn't just wait
for our deaths in the walls.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.200
What we need... is a devil like him!

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:01.870
Eren... Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.420
You killed civilians.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.420
You killed children, too.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.100
You've done things that can't be undone.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:26.190
Mikasa, it's not over yet.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.730
Impossible! I blew away its nape!

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.150
And I crushed it with all my strength.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.620
Yet, it's not dead.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.790
I see...

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:51.010
The War Hammer Titan... It uses
hardening to make whatever it needs.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:56.010
That must be why it won't die,
no matter what we do.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:02.100
Mikasa, get its attention.
If this works, I can eat the War Hammer.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.810
Sorry, we're at full capacity!
And the kid's dead already!

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.190
Come on! At least look at him!

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.530
Aren't you a candidate? Take a look around you!

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.110
We need you, doc!

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.030
Okay, I'm coming!

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.410
Gabi, stay with your family.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:31.710
I'm not sure if anywhere's safe.
Get as far from the plaza as possible.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.590
I'm gonna look for Falco and--

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.380
I'm going, too.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:42.350
Because I don't understand
why Udo and Zofia had to die.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.600
Wait, Gabi! Don't!

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.690
Hey, stop! You're headed towards a war zone!

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:54.650
Gabi!

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.530
What are you doing here?!

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.870
Mr. Gate Guard! I'll fight, so let me through!

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:05.080
Don't be an idiot, brat!
You head back home and...

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:06.690
What the--?!

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.460
Enemy attack?!

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.920
From where?!

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.780
They're above!

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.590
Shit!

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.630
Go on, Gabi! Run!

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.720
Hey, are you--?

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.270
Mister...

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.780
This side's blocked off. Let's go, Sasha.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.490
Conny... Did you forget about the lights?

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.450
Oh, right.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.560
Jean, we stalled the reinforcements.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.980
And the lights?

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.940
They're all in place.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.610
Are things going well?

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.690
For the time being.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:26.080
As long as we take that thing out in time.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.500
But who knows?
Anything can happen at this point.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:41.880
What's to come when this battle is over?
For us to know, we have to survive.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.820
I knew something felt off to me.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.280
It didn't seem right how
the War Hammer appeared.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.910
And that's because its body
formed from the feet up.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:19.090
Not from its nape, but from
underneath the stage.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.430
Which means its body is...

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.710
Shoot! The War Hammer
is about to get eaten!

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:15.190
I've been waiting for this moment!
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:17.650
Eren!

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.360
What?! I can't bite?!

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:30.240
Was that him?! Is that... Ackermann?!

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.170
This ain't looking good!

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.010
You're kidding! Can't you see I'm a Titan?!

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.770
These guys are just humans,
yet they're coming to kill me?!

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.400
These guys... They're the devils of Paradis!

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.130
The devils of Paradis.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:48.510
The Warriors take a stand against
soldiers who soar through the air.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.890
Will Gabi and Falco's cries reach Reiner?

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:54.890
Next episode: "Assault."

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.890
