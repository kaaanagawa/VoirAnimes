WEBVTT

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.100
Fight.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.610
Fight!

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.150
What are you doing?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.490
Were you just saying, "Fight. Fight,"
to the mirror just now?

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.290
Hey. You said, "Fight. Fight," didn't you?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.920
By "Fight. Fight," what are you fighting?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.260
If you're saying, "Fight. Fight,"
does that mean there're two fights?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.100
Keeping quiet isn't helping. Normally,
people don't talk to themselves like that.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.060
I know I've never talked to myself
in the mirror before.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
By the way, I think your hair is cool.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.160
When it's all disheveled, it's kinda like
you're hard-working and carefree.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.030
What did you come for?!

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.410
What? To talk, of course.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.750
The first time we met,
didn't we talk about Titans all night?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.000
Though you mostly listened
as I blabbered on and on.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.930
I honestly believed that you would
never sacrifice Historia.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.020
"A Sound Argument"

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.030
"2 Years Ago"

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.740
Eren, I haven't seen you since you
lifted our ship a whole year ago.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.040
I'm honored to work with you.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.710
No, you won't be working together.
You're lucky enough to see his face.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.590
Plenty enough for me.
Today will be a joyous day.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.850
The port is complete and we're
welcoming our first outside visitor.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.930
From Paradis Island's
sole friendly nation, Hizuru--

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.390
Special Envoy, Kiyomi Azumabito.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.650
Do you recognize this family crest?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.030
That's...

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.490
Show it, Mikasa.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.030
But my mom said to keep it secret.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.920
You showed it to me when we were little.
It's a secret meant for today.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.330
Go on.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.300
Before she died, this symbol was
passed down to me from my mother.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.760
She said I should pass it on to my child.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.350
What an admirable deed!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.440
Over a century ago, the shogun we
Azumabitos descended from had a son.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.450
He was on friendly terms with
King Fritz and often came to Paradis.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.870
After the Great Titan War,
Hizuru was defeated and in disarray.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:38.340
In the confusion, a child of the
shogunate was left behind on the island.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.460
You're the lost descendant
of our nation's ruler!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.720
You're the hope of Hizuru!

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.310
I still don't get what a nation is.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.810
Anyways, now we've got leverage with Hizuru!

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.940
What if it's a trap?

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.690
I suppose we should ask Yelena's opinion.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.780
No! That's exactly what they want!

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.910
One thing is for certain:

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:16.000
The sea has joined us to the world,
but we're still just a child learning to walk.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.250
We should sit quiet and hear
what others have to say.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.090
Hey, why'd you only show Eren that symbol?

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.010
Huh?

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.850
You've never taken off
your wrist wrap for anyone.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.850
Well, that's...

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.520
You seem happy.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.810
I am! You and I were both born
with a heavy burden to bear!

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.610
There's nobody else I'd rather rely on!

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.910
It's a historic day for both our nations.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:59.790
Today is only possible thanks to the one
who brought us together, Zeke Jaeger.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.960
After meeting with him in secret,
we agreed to an arrangement

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.590
under the condition we were
able to meet Lady Mikasa.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.520
First, please take a look at this.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520
That's...!

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:23.150
Huh? This is top-secret in Marley,
but you recognize it?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:29.320
This "omni-directional mobility gear"
is an anti-Titan weapon made in Paradis.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.910
I procured this on my own,
so don't worry. Consider it a gift.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:40.790
However, to make this work,
it needs a special fuel.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.340
They call it "Iceburst Stone."

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.510
It's a unique underground resource
mined only in Paradis.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.810
There should be traces of it inside the weapon.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.640
Zeke Jaeger said if we cooperate with him,

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.440
our nation may just helm an industry
that restores it to its former glory.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.070
And yet, he hasn't even
prospected your reserves.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.990
But a resource like that
in this age of modernization

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.120
would be worth its weight
in jewels and treasure.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.920
I'm being used as a pretext?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.880
Yelena said the talks would go well
since the Azumabitos are money grubbers.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.550
After all, it's not worth the risk
coming here unless money is involved.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:41.270
And? What exactly is the arrangement
you have with Zeke Jaeger?

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.860
As you know, Zeke Jaeger
has a secret plan in mind.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.070
To achieve it, Hizuru's cooperation is needed.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:55.740
Here are his three points to protect
Paradis with the rumbling.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.620
The first is a test run of the rumbling--

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.420
to release a sample of its power
and show the world its devastation.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.960
Next is Hizuru's cooperation.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:16.090
Your military must be strengthened
until use of the rumbling isn't necessary.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:23.560
Lastly, the Founding Titan and a Titan
with royal blood must be passed down.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.600
That's the third point.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.280
Zeke will pass on the Beast Titan
to someone of royal blood.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:36.450
Until their 13-year term ends,
they must bear as many kids as possible.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.790
Even if weaponry advances,
the rumbling itself is powerful.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:49.000
Unless we get rid of it, inheriting Titans
will continue for generations to come.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.140
Is it right for us to push this problem on
our descendants to save ourselves now?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.100
Of course not. But...

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.480
Very well. I will inherit the Beast Titan.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.940
As long as the rumbling is tied to our survival.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.110
Historia...

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:24.250
After years of getting trampled on,
now we've gotta breed like livestock?

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.620
If that's the price of getting to live,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.050
Zeke Jaeger can take
his damn plan and shove it!

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.470
It's too dangerous to gamble
on having the rumbling.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:45.890
We need to spend our time exploring
what other options are available to us.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.020
You should know I felt
the same sense of urgency.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:59.700
But I still don't get why you went on
your own and put the island in danger.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.780
Don't you care about Historia?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.200
I ate the War Hammer Titan.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.290
Huh?

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:13.550
It has the power to harden through
the ground and make whatever it wants.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.130
In other words, there's no prison
deep or strong enough to hold me.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.390
I can leave whenever I want.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.060
I have the Founding Titan and you can't kill me.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.810
You can't kill Zeke either,
even if you threaten to.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:35.610
So, Hange... What is it you can actually do?

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:43.580
Tell me, Hange! If you've got something
up your sleeve, let's hear it!

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.580
Eren, you perv!

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.540
Still in a rebellious phase?! You moron! Idiot!

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.550
Erwin, you only made one mistake in your life.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:05.140
Why did you make me commander?

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.520
Come on inside, Historia.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.520
You've gotta take care of your body.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.070
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Hizuru"
"A small, eastern nation with its own unique culture whose head of state is called a 'shogun.' Producing many talented engineers, Hizuru has flourished in weapons and aircraft development and was at one time an ally of the Eldian Empire. The crest of the 'shogunate' depicts three single-edge swords in its design."

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.160
We should've stuck with our plan

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.540
and fed Zeke to Historia as soon
as he got to the island.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.460
Who would've thought?!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.590
She played around and got pregnant!

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.050
In the end, she's a low-bred girl
who's Queen in name only.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.680
Hey! Quit it.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.970
The Queen is free to choose a partner.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.270
We've already confirmed the guy
isn't anyone's lackey.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.980
They grew up in the same area.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.950
Back then, he apparently threw rocks
at her trying to get her attention.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.580
He started helping at her
orphanage out of guilt.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.040
He worked with his head down for years,
but the one who approached the other...

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.250
...was the Queen.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.960
Who cares about their love story?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.890
The problem is, why did the Queen
decide to get pregnant all of a sudden?!

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:31.270
Someone told her! "If you're pregnant,
they won't make you a Titan!"

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:38.770
I bet it was Yelena. That woman is nuts,
but she's smart enough to be dangerous.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.690
"If the Queen is pregnant,
Zeke lives another day!"

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.780
Hey! You're drunk, Roeg.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.780
We should do it anyways.
Make her a Titan, pregnant or not.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.620
Her child might die. And if something
happens to the Queen, it's over.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.790
Giving birth is risky enough as it is.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:03.670
That sound argument
might just ruin our country!

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.470
Hey! Bring another bottle, Marleyan!

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.220
Certainly.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.510
Greiz.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.180
Nicolo...

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.690
This one, right?

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:29.160
Hey! Is this... something...
they really needed us... to do?!

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.410
Nope! We wouldn't be doing this,
but that idiot opened their mouth.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:41.460
"We can develop the island and
our muscles at the same time," my ass.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.720
We can't do much but wait
for Hizuru's answer anyways.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:51.010
Yeah. And hope they can be
our mediator to the world.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:58.230
We're grasping at straws here trying to
avoid the rumbling and save Historia.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.860
--Yeah
--Hey!

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.820
Man, you're all working hard in this heat!

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.120
Yeah, well, we're stuck watching this idiot.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.250
Unbelievable. You're all growing so damn big.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.830
Is it about Hizuru?

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.790
The Azumabitos sent their reply.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.960
And?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.510
No good. Looks like we can't turn to Hizuru.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.550
It seems they want to monopolize
Paradis Island's resources.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.640
They won't help us trade with others.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:41.310
The world wants Paradis Island
to be the root of all evil.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:47.110
It helps to unite all nations
and brings stability to the world.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:56.660
So, we've got no choice but to rely on
the rumbling and sacrifice Historia?

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.660
That's right.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:03.750
You're kidding! They decided we're
devils without knowing our intentions?

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.840
Why won't they consider a path of peace?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.800
I think... because they don't know.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.640
They fear us because they
don't know what we are.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.150
That's right. They won't trust people
whose faces they haven't seen.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:28.110
So let's meet 'em! If you don't
understand something, go figure it out!

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.450
Isn't that what we Scouts do?

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.030
Make a base in Marley and infiltrate, huh?

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:39.580
Hange sure has a plan for everything.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.670
I'll be able to chow down
on real Marleyan cuisine!

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:48.840
Yeah? What should I bring?
It would stink to get the runs.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.630
Stomach medicine, toothbrush,
a taste of home...

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.300
Did you even hear Hange's plan?

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:02.020
If the world knows that we want peace,
maybe something will change.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.650
If only we had more time.
I've got just over five years left.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:18.120
We're gonna have to decide
who inherits my Titan soon.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.330
I will.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.580
Not you. We still don't know
what the Ackermanns are.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.630
And won't it hurt any plans with Hizuru
if you become a Titan?

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.180
No, for so many reasons.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.840
Then who will?

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.430
Me. First of all, I'm way smarter than Eren.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.850
Instead of a suicidal maniac,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.980
you'll have a gifted leader who shows
good judgment in all situations.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.150
In other words, me.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.320
I hate getting an Eren hand-me-down,
but who better than me?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.490
Someone that amazing we don't
wanna lose in 13 years, moron.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.410
Huh?!

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.460
You should aim to be a regiment leader.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:10.000
I'll inherit Eren's Titan.
It works out good, right?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.920
Conny...

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.760
That's not good at all. You're an idiot.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.680
Eh?

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.060
Don't "eh" me. We can't leave such
an important role up to an idiot.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.470
Eh?

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.350
Doggone it... I'll inherit it.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:32.280
I've got combat experience...
I'm someone you can trust...

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.650
By process of elimination, it's gotta be me.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:36.780
You guys...

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:40.450
I dun wanna. I sure dun wanna though.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.750
Wait, huh? Isn't that weird?

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.830
What?

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:50.590
Well, you know...
You said an idiot's not fit for the role.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.710
Hmm?

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:58.550
You're more of an idiot than I am,
so you're contradicting yourself.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.640
Huh?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.510
Huh...?

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.270
I don't want any of you to inherit it.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.060
Why not?

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.650
Because you're important to me.
More than anyone else.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.820
So, I want you to have long lives.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:37.470
Huh?! What are you turning red for?!
The hell kinda mood is this?!

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.840
Sorry.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.180
Jean, it's the sunset.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.810
It's making our faces red.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.520
Oh. Nothing we can do about the sun.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:14.340
To think Commander Pyxis would go
so far as to detain the volunteers.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.800
Since they and the Scouts are so close,
we weren't told in advance.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.140
Yeah. I'm sure he didn't have much choice.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:29.640
Until Zeke's intentions are made clear,
it puts us in a real pickle.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.310
And Eren's suddenly aboard Zeke's plan.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:39.650
Whatever the two of them talked about
is something only they know.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.320
Hey. Did that look like Eren to you guys?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.540
Not me. That wasn't Eren.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:54.250
If he's made up his mind to side
with his half-brother over us...

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.920
If he has, then what?

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.210
We've gotta be prepared
to cut him down if necessar--

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:01.760
I won't let you!

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.090
Huh?

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.970
Are you siding with them, too, Mikasa?

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.140
I don't think it'll come to that.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.770
Eren cares about us more than anyone.
You guys should know that.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:28.410
Maybe that's why he's so hostile
to anyone who isn't one of us.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.620
He cares too much.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.500
That's not it.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:39.250
No matter how strong you were, the old him
tried to keep you off the front lines.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.340
But he made Armin destroy the port
and pulled you into the fight.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.010
All of us, too. The ones he called important.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.350
I think that's because he trusts us.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.390
If we hadn't gone, he couldn't have done it.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.560
And Sasha wouldn't have died.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.740
Mikasa... When Sasha died, what did Eren do?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:08.030
Did he cry? Did he regret his actions?

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.830
Conny, stop.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.620
He laughed.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:18.920
What part of it was so funny to him?
What part of Sasha dying?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.970
Explain it to me, Mikasa. Why was Eren laughing?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:28.550
You know everything about him, right?

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:33.770
We'll talk to Eren. Just me, Mikasa, and him.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.140
We'll find out his goal.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:41.730
But will it help? What if his goals
are the same as Zeke's?

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:47.530
Now that the military has Titan serum,
we've got options.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.780
You don't mean--!

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.490
The option of making someone
we trust into a Titan,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.210
who would then inherit Eren's Founding Titan.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.150
Gabi and Falco escape from prison.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:52.740
Alone and lost, they receive a helping hand
from a devil they're meant to hate.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.580
Next episode: "Deceiver."

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.580
"Deceiver"
