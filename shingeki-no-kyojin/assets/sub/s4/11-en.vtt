00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.730
Gabi! Hey! What's wrong?!

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.610
Hey! Settle down!

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.230
What's wrong?! What happened?!

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.440
She's in pain!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.820
Hey! You okay, missy?

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.500
Gabi! That's overkill!

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.380
How's running away gonna help?!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.390
We'll be killed if we stay!

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.390
That guy was worried about you!

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.680
Can you trust those devils?!

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.890
I can't even trust Zeke anymore!
Or anyone else!

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.780
Having nightmares or something?

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.290
How I wish this all was a dream.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.600
I heard Gabi and Falco's voices.
Where are those two?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.020
"Deceiver"

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.090
We must've gone pretty far.
We ran all through the night.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.380
Hey, take off your armband. You'll stand out.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.160
If any normal person sees it,
they won't know what it means.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.790
But soldiers will know what it is.
Just take it off.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.160
There're no soldiers out here in the sticks.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.550
Someone will see it eventually!
Who knows if we'll make it back home?!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.650
I don't plan to. I just wanna get answers
from Zeke before I'm caught and killed.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.460
"Did you really betray us and Marley?"
"Why did you do it?"

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.320
You can do whatever you want.
You don't have to follow me.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
Fine, then. I'll do whatever I want,
starting with trashing this.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.900
Give it back!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.700
What for?! What's the point
of even wearing it here?!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.980
I'm a good Eldian! Without that,
I'm the same as the island devils!

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.110
What are you saying?! You're acting crazy!

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.840
Then, just leave me alone!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.410
Why... did you come with me?

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.260
You didn't have to die, too!

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.100
What are you doing?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.540
It's so early in the morning.
Where did you come from?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.660
I-I don't wanna say. We hated our
home and ran away from it all.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.730
So, we can't go back.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.920
I see. Are you guys hungry?
I live nearby, so follow me.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.340
Wait here a minute.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.080
Okay.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.890
Let's take the horse and run.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.340
What are you talking about?

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.560
They'll come and search here, too.
We've gotta run farther.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.470
Besides, I'm not gonna
share a meal with devils.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.820
Listen here--

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.190
All right! Come on in!

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.450
O-Okay! We'll be right there!

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.370
I'll do all the talking,
so keep your mouth shut.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.640
You younguns are the runaways?
Who might ya be?

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.170
A southern Marleyan accent?

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.670
Nice to meet you!
We're siblings, Ben and Mia!

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.970
We have our reasons,
but we ran away from home!

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.470
We'll do whatever work you want!
Please, let us stay for just a few days!

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.730
Please!

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.730
You younguns don't need
to be bowin' like that.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.330
Welcome to Braus Stables.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.320
Y'all can stay as long as ya like.
C'mon, join us for breakfast.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.120
Are y'all tired? Go lie down
once yer done eatin'.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.550
Lisa, the lass is...

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.880
I'm sorry. I'm sure y'all
been through a lot.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.220
Well...

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.600
Sorry about my little sister!
Th-Thanks for breakfast!

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.780
Delicious! It's so good!

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.020
It's really so good!

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.150
C'mon! Eat up, Mia!

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.420
Congratulations on your successful
campaign against Marley.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.420
The leaders of Hizuru have nothing
but praise for Eldia's bravery.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.180
We're deeply honored. Welcome to
the world's most dangerous island.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.190
Indeed. But this time, our goal is to
witness said danger in person.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.570
Is that the observation 
craft you've spoken of?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.860
Yes. It may just be the world's first
flying boat powered by Iceburst Stone.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.700
With it, we will ascertain the
true power of the rumbling.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.780
Are the rumors true about Jaeger being
imprisoned and the volunteers detained?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.840
We want an explanation, Hange!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.960
Why are there orders to 
evacuate Shiganshina?!

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.220
Reeves Company was put
in charge of rebuilding it!

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.760
Ask the MPs.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.060
Hange! Jaeger's victory
opened the path to our future!

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.480
A future where Eldians can live!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.110
If that's true, all Eldians should have
a voice in how Jaeger is handled!

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.910
Hange, you once said, "Taxpayers
decide what to make of information."

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.360
Have you changed your views?

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.540
The situation has changed!
Our walls are open to the world!

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.870
The meaning of info has changed!

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.770
I know you're in a tough situation, Hange.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.010
So look me in my eyes
and tell me I can trust you.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.720
This is all for the sake 
of the Eldian people.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.730
You're the ones who leaked
the info about Eren?

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.950
Holger, Wim, Louise...
You three recruits, and Floch.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.880
Why did you do it?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:50.050
Because Eren should be freed.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.480
He challenged an imposing enemy
and grasped victory.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:01.220
Victory in the form of the rumbling,
which secures our right to live.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.190
Eren saved the lives of everyone
in the New Eldian Empire.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:12.740
There's no guarantee that the rumbling
works as planned and can save us.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.840
At this point, it's no more than a myth.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.700
Only because you're keeping Eren locked up.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.940
Do we really have the luxury of wasting time?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.080
At this rate, our victory will be squandered.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.840
Eren Jaeger will lead our country.
Please, release him at once.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.810
Yeah, you might just be right about that.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:47.190
One way or another, I made the
decision to carry out Zeke's plan.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.480
The full responsibility is mine.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.230
Therefore, I won't tolerate disobedience.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.500
You will be tried for leaking
information about Eren.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.760
Have them confined.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.330
If it's for the sake of humanity, so be it.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:19.380
This role of ours... There's an order to it.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.890
When one's role is done,
another steps in to start the act again.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.390
Good luck, Hange.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.950
I'm pooped.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.860
No... There's more I need to investigate.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.670
Have you ever been in this cell, Mikasa?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.550
Huh? No.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.770
I see. That's a shame.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:05.930
Oh, I don't regret what I did.
If victory is our ultimate goal,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.060
obeying the laws isn't
the end all be all, right?

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.810
Stop it, Louise. You'll only be here longer.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.070
I'm still the same person
as the one you saved that day.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.160
I realized something when you,
a human, took down that Titan:

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.660
That without power,
you can't protect anything.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.950
I learned that it's okay to fight
against senseless violence.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.910
Ever since that day,
I wanted to get closer to you, so I...

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.310
Why did you join the
Scout Regiment, Mikasa?

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.270
If it was for Jaeger, freeing him--

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:57.190
I only have one thing to say:
Keep your mouth shut.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.440
You're safe now...

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.570
...Mikasa.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:29.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Paradis Island Devils"
"An insult referring to King Fritz and the Eldians who fled to Paradis Island. In Titan studies, the 'Paradis Island Threat' theory claims the Eldians who fled there still bear a grudge from the Great Titan War and despise the rest of the world. With the threat of Eren Jaeger now apparent, the insult holds truer than ever."

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.400
Ten months ago, there was an opening
celebration for the Trost railway.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.940
The guard watching you suddenly
changed...

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.680
to Floch Forster.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.400
While the party was in full swing,
Floch escorted you to your lodgings--

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.080
a man currently detained for leaking info.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:58.510
Furthermore, your lodgings were a few
dozen kilometers from Eren's home.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:05.490
It just so happens that around this time,
Eren began moving on his own.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.400
On the bright side, now I have
an excuse to talk with a pretty lady.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.910
Huh?!

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.290
Gabi!

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.750
Gabi!

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.710
Gabi!

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.680
Why is this happening to me?

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.970
This is the devil's doing!

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.660
No, I think it's the horse's doing.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.400
There's not a horse that 
would let you ride it.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.450
Well, I wasn't trained how to ride one.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.370
We won't learn a thing 
out here in the sticks.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.820
I think it's better to hunker
down here than roam around.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.740
What are you talking about?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.620
We can stay here and wait for help.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.750
Eventually, the world will attack the island.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.380
I bet Reiner and my brother will come, too.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.870
Aren't you pissed at Zeke?!
There was a traitor right among us!

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.220
There's nothing we can do.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.140
And what the hell is "Mia"?
Why am I your little sister?!

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.160
Does it even matter?

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.020
Hey, guys. Let's have lunch.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.130
You're quick learners and hard-working, too.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.030
You think? Thank you.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.690
By the way, Kaya. I noticed all
the workers here are pretty young.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.800
Yeah. Everyone here is an orphan.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.740
Oh, really?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.170
The Queen's policies give support
to kids without families.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.440
All of us here lost our 
parents four years ago.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.180
You haven't accepted your guilt.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.050
--Huh?
--Wha--?!

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:20.480
Have you forgotten the atrocities
the people of this island committed?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.070
Only when an Eldian accepts the depths
of their sins can they begin to atone.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.950
Is that related to our parents dying?

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:36.950
Of course. Even if you act like a saint,
your sins are too great to escape.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:40.210
--Is that what they teach you in Marley?
--We're in her debt, you know!

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.010
--These are indisputable truths!
--Would you just...?

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.210
What did you just say?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.710
You two came from Marley, right?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.370
How did you...?

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:54.220
You have to ask? You yelled it out loud.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.390
Huh? Uh... You knew from the get-go?

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.200
Really? From the start? I'm so embarrassed!

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.730
Why didn't you say something?
You're so sneaky!

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.860
Huh?!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.830
What are you doing?!

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.660
The devil revealed her true colors!

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.840
I knew something was up!
Island devils can't be this kind!

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.330
Stop, you idiot!

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.590
Hey!

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:28.590
What's all the fuss about?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.340
Shoot!

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.810
Mia's jealous and thinks
I'm stealing her brother!

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:40.520
Kaya's actually getting along with
people? She's cheered up some.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.660
Good grief... Don't horse around
or you'll get hurt!

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.610
Sorry!

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.110
Why?

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.890
This village used to be my home.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.490
Four years ago, a Titan showed up here.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.540
The villagers ran when they saw it
and left behind my mom, who couldn't run.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.950
There was nothing I could do, so I sat down.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:17.560
From right here, I sat and listened
to my mom get eaten.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.340
She was alive the whole time it happened.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.390
Eventually, she went silent.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.770
I think she screamed 
until she lost her voice.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:34.770
They say humanity outside the walls
thinks that we're devils.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.280
But I don't understand why
we're hated so much.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:45.040
Mia, Ben. Tell me.
What exactly did my mom do?

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.040
What did she do to be hated so much?

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.800
Your kind slaughtered people
for thousands of years!

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.920
Thousands?

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.430
Don't tell me you forgot it!

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:03.430
Eldians used the Power of the Titans
to trample and rule the world for millennia!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.930
They wiped out other cultures,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.560
forced them to bear their children,
and murdered endless droves of people!

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.840
Stop playing the victim!

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.320
My mom was born and raised here.
She never did anything like that.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.100
But a century ago, the sins of your
ancestors were terrible and great!

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:30.580
A century ago? What about the people
who live now? How have we sinned?

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.460
Not long ago, you guys trampled my home.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.360
My mom was killed four years ago,
so it's not her fault.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.850
I'm telling you, your ancestors
killed people all over the--

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.850
My mom didn't kill anyone!

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.940
Answer me, Mia! Why did my mom
have to suffer like that?

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.030
There has to be a reason!
It's crazy if there's not!

00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:00.740
Why was my mom eaten alive, huh?!
Why was she killed?!

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.740
Huh?! Why?!

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.260
It was recon-in-force.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.510
The invasion of Paradis four years ago
was staging for a larger attack.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.930
You and your mother were caught up in it.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.010
Your mom didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.160
I'm sorry.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.150
You're leaking secrets to the enemy.
And why apologize?

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.050
Thanks for letting me know, Ben.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:43.660
But it's weird for you to apologize
for Marley. You were just born there.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.830
So, how did you manage to escape and survive?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:59.670
A girl a bit older than I am now grabbed
a hatchet and started hitting the Titan.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.680
No way! That's crazy!

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:08.520
Yeah. She put herself between me and
the Titan and allowed me to escape.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.300
If she was alive, she wouldn't abandon
people like you with nowhere to go.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.600
Just like she didn't abandon me.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.780
We were invited to a restaurant
a Marleyan is working at.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:30.540
If you come along, you might find
a way to go back home.

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.790
Why...?

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.880
I want to become a person like her.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:47.420
Investigating the Beast Titan's corpse,
we found pieces of Zeke blown apart.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:54.080
However, not enough of them.
We only found his arms and legs.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.740
He pretended that he was dead
in order to deceive us.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:04.860
We believe Zeke has sided with Paradis
and escaped on the airship.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:11.540
This modified Anti-Personnel ODM gear
utilizes Marleyan technology.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.600
There's also the airship they stole.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.350
It executed advanced maneuvers
only a trained pilot could perform.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.990
Zeke probably sneaked comrades
aboard the scout fleet four years ago--

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.030
Eldian Restorationists, that is.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:34.370
Sh-Shit. To think we fought side-by-side
with a traitor this whole time.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.380
Obviously, we won't let him off the hook.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:43.500
Within six months, a global alliance
will launch an offensive on Paradis.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.630
S-Six months?! We're waiting six months
to rescue Gabi and Falco?

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:54.180
They're the most talented Warrior candidates.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.640
It'll be a huge blow to 
Marley if we lose them.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.650
And training new Warrior
candidates will take ages.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:09.320
But if Marley attacks alone,
we'll only be driven back like last time.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.910
We must wait for the global alliance.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.480
Zeke is hoping we will.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:19.670
He thinks Marley won't attack
after taking such heavy damage.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:25.420
If we wait half a year to get there,
he'll have made plans to fight back.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:28.540
We can't wait for the global alliance!

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.430
We have to launch a surprise attack at once!

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:46.400
Who should one hate?
What should one blame?

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.740
By now, one should've been used
to the shifting of truth.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.720
Next episode: "Guides."

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.490
