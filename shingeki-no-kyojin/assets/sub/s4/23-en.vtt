00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.620
I found a survivor!

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.260
This way! Get her to safety!

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.030
Be careful!

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.320
Don't worry.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.010
You're all fine now.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.050
The Wall Titans are marching off
the island in lines.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.610
It does appear they have no intention
to harm us, but they scare me.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.550
Just what's happening?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.080
Like that strange dream we just had.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.960
My house...

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.990
My house's all gone
because of Eren Yeager...

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.630
What's wrong with just
a sacrifice or two?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.830
How dare you!

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.040
He lost his son, you know!

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.580
A lot of people also died
when the walls collapsed.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.850
No, Eren killed them!

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.400
That's right!

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.500
Eren Yeager killed his own people!

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.050
But if he hadn't summoned the Wall Titans,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.080
the Eldians on this island would've
all been slaughtered by the outsiders!

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.950
That's right! Our Eldian Empire survived
thanks to those noble sacrifices!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.780
We won!

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.790
No victory can be achieved
without sacrifice!

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.770
Their deaths were not in vain!

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.520
Dedicate your hearts!

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.410
Dedicate your hearts!

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.680
Dedicate your hearts!

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.460
Hitch.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.790
This isn't good.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.170
The citizens are bound to clash
when they're highly excited.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.670
We need to equip ourselves.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.710
Take all the riot gear you can with you!

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.040
Yes, ma'am!

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.570
Good grief, what are those guys
even doing in Shiganshina?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.900
It's coming from the basement?

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.530
If you scream...

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.460
I'll cut up your throat.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.560
First, take off that jacket--

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.010
You've gotten so weak,
I thought you were a granny.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.830
I bet you wouldn't have expected
to be thrown like this by me, huh?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.900
Annie!

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.410
Out of all people, it has to be you?

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.640
Hitch.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.840
Anyway, I must take
her to the basement.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.670
If I don't restrain her, the town could...

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.640
Somebody!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.960
It's pointless.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.290
I already cut myself.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.580
I can turn into a Titan anytime I want.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.860
You have no choice but to obey me.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.640
Are you sure?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.700
I bet you don't have the stamina
to transform when you're that weak.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.460
You may be right.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.430
But we won't know until I try.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.300
Dreyse! Is something wrong?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.130
Dreyse! I'll open the door!

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.030
Dreyse?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.380
Rumbling, Rumbling, it's coming

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.290
Rumbling, Rumbling

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.260
Beware

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.680
Coming for you

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.650
All I ever wanted to do was do right things

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.320
I've never wanted to be the king, I swear

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.280
All I ever wanted to do was save your life

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
I've never wanted to grab a knife, I swear

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.840
Tearless, fearless, burning, burning

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.090
You tell me what have I missed

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.680
Still wandering in the deep mist

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.720
If I lose it all, slip and fall

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.560
I will never look away

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.480
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.400
If I lose it all outside the wall

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.740
Live to die another day

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.120
I don't want anything

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.500
I'm just here to...

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.540
Beware

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.980
Sunset

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.950
You sure are more clever
than I thought, Hitch.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.460
Shut up.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.950
If you're going away,
then I have no reason to stop you.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.130
At least now I don't have to watch
your face every day in the basement.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.400
Good for you.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.750
Now it's finally over.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.200
I don't have to listen to your
complaints about men anymore.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.270
How do you know that?

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.780
Don't tell me, you...

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.920
You were conscious the whole time?

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.280
For four years.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.880
It all felt like I was
seeing a hazy dream.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:59.150
I can hear your voice and Armin's
as if it's coming from afar.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.300
But when I don't hear your voices,
it's all the same.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.330
I was in the darkness.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.780
So I had a decent idea of what's
happening outside from the two of you.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.840
Then, I suddenly
find myself released.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.290
And I heard Eren's voice.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.350
He said he is going to
destroy the world.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.890
Is he serious?

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.450
So he really released
the Wall Titans...

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.670
Check up their footsteps, too.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.280
The only meaningful job
I've done as a soldier

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.830
was cleaning up corpses and rubble.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.880
Like after you and Eren
fought the last time.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.120
Can you tell me now?

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.340
How did it feel like seeing
the corpses you guys stomped

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.970
for your oh-so-grand goal?

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.550
You asked me so many times,
so I give it a thought.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.660
It's something I never thought about.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.320
To kill someone was something
we were praised for.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.530
We were taught to kill anyone,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.100
be it combatants or civilians
beyond the border.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:31.830
It's to atone for the sins of us Eldians
and to save the world.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.660
That's how they justified all our actions.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.150
Armin told us all about what
you guys went through.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.700
In other words...

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.100
You guys wanted to stop that, right?

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.230
So those corpses under the rubble
are just a minor sacrifice to you?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.070
No.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.340
I never cared about saving the world.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.600
Huh?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.750
I didn't care about anything.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.700
My parents abandoned me
shortly after I was born.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.700
Turned out my mother
was cheating with an Eldian.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.070
I was later taken in and
raised in the internment zone

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.980
by an Eldian man
who came from overseas.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.640
Apparently, he was taken to
the internment zone for a similar reason.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.060
The man wanted to train me
into a Marleyan soldier

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.170
so he can improve his living environment.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.850
For as long as I can remember,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.010
the man beat the martial arts
of his homeland into me.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.780
The only value that man sees in me

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.140
was whether or not
I could become a Warrior.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.710
After some time passed...

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.390
I became strong just as the man wanted.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.220
So I paid him back for all the pain
he'd beat into me.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.720
I made it so he'd never be able
to walk straight again.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.500
But...

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.600
The man rejoiced.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.880
"Now you can kill your enemy
even when unarmed," he said.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.480
Hmm? Wait, wait.
What is it about again?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.090
I had to listen to your life story
for four years.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.250
So you could at least
hear me out for a little while.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.270
And so everything stopped
to matter to me.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.070
I didn't care who died, no matter
who they are or where they came from.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.890
I didn't think life has any value,
not even my own.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.310
Until that moment.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.760
On the morning
I'd be heading off to the island,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.830
the man dropped to
his knees and apologized.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.180
He told me that everything
he taught me was wrong.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.430
He then cried and pleaded.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.570
He wanted me to come back.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.870
My status as a Warrior, and
our status as honorary Marleyans...

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.750
He told me to give up
those things and return.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.610
That man... was my father.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.530
He thought of me as his own daughter.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.260
I have a father who waits for my return.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.560
And just like me...

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.080
Other people also have those
who are important to them.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.500
I'm done thinking
that nothing matters to me.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.880
I'm fully aware that
I've committed irredeemable sins.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.930
But...

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.930
If it's for returning to my father...

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.470
I won't hesitate to repeat what I did.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.770
I see.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.670
I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.430
But even if you return
to your father's place,

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.550
you would only find rubble and a corpse.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.960
You may be right.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.130
Believe me! It's true!

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.590
Did you see that dream as well?

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.250
So this day finally comes...

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.190
The island devils are coming
to attack us all.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.420
No way, then Gabi and Falco now...

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.420
The Rumbling has been activated!

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.970
Eren Yeager will come to kill everyone!

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.020
Your house, your wife's family,
everything will be crushed!

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.090
I'm telling you that you've got no proof!

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.500
You say you all had the same dream?!

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.640
You want us to believe
that nonsense and let you out?!

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:06.020
I bet you've all been plotting
this together to escape from here!

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.670
I'm sure all Eldians all over the world
are saying the same thing!

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.410
Do you still insist that
we plotted all that?!

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.140
But it's not impossible!

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.340
You're all now guilty of conspiracy!

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.310
We'll now restrain all of you!

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.020
On your knees!

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.910
Hands behind your heads!

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.550
Hurry it up!

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.320
So please promise me.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.230
That you'll come back.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.040
I will.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.240
I promise.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.680
A gunshot?

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.340
Instructor!

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.880
The Yeagerist have gathered
to take over this fort.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.300
We need to hurry and run.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.290
If they find us, who knows
what they'll do to you.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.350
It's fine.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.440
I don't have anywhere else to go.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.510
The center military councils are gone,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.760
thanks to us chopping
off their napes just now.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.200
The Yeagerist have
the support of the people.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.850
I'm sure they'll take control
of this island.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.740
They'll be sure to wipe out member
of the old order like me.

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:29.140
And it's not like I have the energy

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.070
to live out the rest of my years
in the mountain away from civilization.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.740
We would have all died
had you not saved us.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.720
We'll protect you no matter what!

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.990
You damned fools.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:48.400
Why do you think I let a bunch of pissants
kick and stomp me to the ground?

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.570
Do as the Yeagerist say and
don't disobey them.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.040
The likes of you wouldn't be able
to protect anyone but yourself.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.030
Stay here and join the flow.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.540
But...

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.900
However.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.220
The day will come for you to raise up.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.130
Until then, don't ever
lose sight of who you are.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.620
Armin, wait.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.200
Even if you go now,
you'll not make it to Ragako in time.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.960
Besides...

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.660
What will you do even
if you catch up to him?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.930
Will you tell him to give up on
returning his mom back into human?

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.750
I will.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.240
Even if doesn't work, I have to show
everything I can through action.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.990
Or else, Gabi won't trust me.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.840
That kid's our only hope.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.270
She's our key to negotiating
with Reiner and the Cart Titan

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.910
who are hiding somewhere.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.530
It's not as if the issue of who gets
to inherit the Nine Titans is going away.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.110
In the worse case,

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:03.530
we'd repeat the last 2,000 years of conflict
surrounding the power of Titans...

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.990
...on this tiny island.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.910
To be honest, I'm so tired

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.140
I could hop into bed and sleep
for around two days straight.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.290
Anyway, I need to do everything I can.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.150
This will massively impact what
little future humanity has left.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.620
I will tell Connie!

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.340
I'll tell him to let his mom
continue to lie down as a Titan!

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:30.440
I'm off.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.840
Armin.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.430
What should I do?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.580
You should help Jean.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.930
You should try to think for yourself.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.400
What about Eren?

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.700
What will you do?

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.190
I don't know!

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.320
I mean, just what can we even do?!

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.830
Hange and Captain could be dead right now.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.000
Floch and his men might even
point their guns at us.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.130
Also, Annie might be back into action.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.360
The military's chain of command is broken!

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:04.470
It's chaos!

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.930
That's right, even Historia
could be in danger.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.290
The Volunteers, the Azumabito,
and Niccolo might be in danger, too.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.130
We can't afford to think about Eren!
He's a lost cause!

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.090
You should know that much!

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.910
Sorry.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.810
If Commander Erwin were here,

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:38.970
I'm sure he wouldn't have
snapped at you like this.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.180
Eh?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.290
The answer is clear now.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.860
I shouldn't have been
the one to come back.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.480
My scarf is gone?

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.590
It might be for his mother's sake,

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.830
but I'm sure Connie will think hard
about sacrificing a child and hesitate.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.740
I know you will make it.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.150
Thank you, Mr. Blouse.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.280
I think I'll stay under
Mr. Blouse's care for now.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.310
All right.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.180
You all should hurry and
leave this place, too.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.540
Mia.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.050
Be well.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.780
My real name is Gabi.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.330
Eh? But Gabi sounds weird.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.860
I like Mia more.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.070
Huh?!

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.160
See you, Kaya.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.960
Good bye, Gabi.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.670
Floch, stop it!

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.810
Don't shoot!

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.670
Relax, Jean.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.980
I'm just teaching them a lesson.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.920
He didn't grasp the situation he was in.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.490
But now this gets the message across.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.780
Now everyone knows what would happen
if they speak up in the wrong way.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.600
Hey, just who the hell asked you
to act like the boss around here?

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.620
Glad you asked, Jean!

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.090
Everyone, listen up!

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.540
Ten months ago, Eren told me his plan!

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.190
His plan was to make use of Zeke
and seize control over the Founding!

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.250
I gathered comrades to help Eren.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.680
And today, the plan succeeded!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.820
You Volunteers have lost your leader!

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.060
Including the military
who backed you up!

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.120
And now you'll also lose your homeland!

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.710
All that remains would be giant footsteps
thanks to the Rumbling!

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.830
You've lost your reason for coming here,
which was to revive your homelands!

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.070
But,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.070
if any of you still wishes to lend your
strength to the Eldian Empire,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.610
speak up now and here!

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.260
We will take you in and accept you
as our Eldian brethren!

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.160
Shut your mouth, you lunatic!

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.280
- Who do you think will--
- Show this man some respect!

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.230
He refused to submit even
in the face of a bullet,

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.390
and lived as a proud Volunteer
until the end.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.470
But there's no need to die for pride.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.820
What's so bad about submitting?

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.330
Wouldn't you rather live
than to die like this?

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.890
I'll give you time to think.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.450
Take then to their cells.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.470
Yes, sir!

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.520
What's this?

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.040
Jean, what happened?

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.110
To answer your earlier question.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.450
I speak on Eren's behalf.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.470
If Eren's going to solve
all problems beyond the island,

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.980
I'll wipe away
any resentment left within it.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:11.800
Anyway, we survived that hell
four years ago

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.080
and finally have this moment.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.290
Do you know what is this?

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:19.800
This is freedom.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.600
You guys don't have to fight anymore.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.390
You can live however you want.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.320
Hey, Jean.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.740
You wanted to join the Military Police and
live a comfortable life in the central, right?

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.110
You should do so.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.510
You're now one of our heroes!

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.450
Is it really over?

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.460
It's over.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.040
You can now go back
to how you used to be.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.620
To that annoying, irresponsible,
conceited bastard.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.700
What'd you just call me?

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.420
Floch...

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.430
What happened to Captain Levi
and Commander Hange?

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.540
Oh, yeah.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.130
Zeke killed them, unfortunately.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.960
Mister Connie, I'm grateful
that you saved me, but...

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.810
We've been heading north, haven't we?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.980
Look, the sun's setting over there.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.590
It's fine.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.330
The south is too dangerous.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.290
I'm taking you to a safe hospital
where they can treat your amnesia.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.370
You really were all on your own
when you collapsed.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.980
This is the least I could do as a soldier.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.250
That's right.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.010
I'm a soldier now.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.010
Connie, be a good soldier and
protect everyone, okay?

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.660
Dad, Sunny, and Martin are
not coming back anymore.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.050
But I can at least bring my mom back.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.520
Please wait for me just
a little bit longer, Mom.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.350
I've become a soldier, and now...

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.510
Thank you very much, Mister Connie.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.530
You're doing so much just for me.

00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:02.470
It's fine.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.460
I'm glad Mister Connie is a good person.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.580
But I need to go back
to the south somehow.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.500
I remember meeting Colt and Gabi.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.270
But what happened after that?

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:18.400
Also...

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.060
I feel I've seen Mister Connie
somewhere before.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.280
But since he doesn't know me,
I might be just imagining it.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.450
Judging from their direction and speed,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.670
the ships are withdrawing
straight back to Marley.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.410
They probably think we Marleyan
forces won't make it back alive

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.410
after seeing the Rumbling.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.980
No, it's a smart move.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.700
Now they can let the rest of the nation
know about the situation as fast as possible.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.800
It's far better than just waiting
for those things to crush us all.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.410
But now there's nothing more we can do.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.990
Do you have any plans on
how to stop them?

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:10.850
No.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.640
But we'll keep our
pathetic struggle til the end.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.120
Umm...

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.600
Please wait!

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.040
Just don't eat me, okay?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.040
I don't have any weapons
on me right now.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.890
Oh? The guy over there?

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.420
Please don't worry.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:36.970
He's just a completely harmless guy
who barely escaped death.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.250
The marching army of Titans.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.340
In face of such a massive threat
that will trample their whole world,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.660
will people just froze,
or will they stand up?

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.710
Next time, "Pride."
