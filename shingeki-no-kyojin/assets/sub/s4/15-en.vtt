WEBVTT

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.060
Take a good look, Zeke.
That's Liberio, where we live.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.730
Compared to the world,
it's like a tiny birdcage.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.110
Since we can't leave,
we have to live here till we die.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.450
Zeke, wouldn't you like to leave?

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.580
Yeah, I would.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.380
Oh, what's this? We hardly ever
get visitors this early.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.550
I'll come back later.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.010
It's okay. We're on our way out.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.930
Oh, Eldians?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.060
Wh-What?! We got permission
to leave the walls!

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.770
It's my job to clean the tower
and get rid of trash.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.320
You came in here and defiled it, you devils!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.950
Your kind slaughtered countless lives!
Yet here you are, pumping out kids?!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.410
Devils!

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.410
Stay in the internment zone!

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.910
You guys stink!

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.630
--Thanks for ruining my day!
--Remember this well, Zeke.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.800
This is the outside world.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.760
If you don't like it, you've gotta change it.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.680
Zeke, you're going to save everyone.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.020
"Sole Salvation"

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.700
One of these kids will be my successor?

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.080
Yes, we'll choose one.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.410
One of them is falling behind. Who's that?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.000
Ah. Jaeger again?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.670
All the other kids are fiercely competing
to be Honorary Marleyans.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.090
Yet he has none of that drive.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.300
Why does he even come here?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.220
How was training, Zeke?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.930
It's really tough.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.900
I see. But I know you can be a Warrior.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.820
Because you have a special power.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.070
And most important of all, you're our son!

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.780
Right!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.120
Father, Mother. Thanks for watching Zeke.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.330
Yeah.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.040
I baked your favorite pie today.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.200
Yippee!

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.130
Your social dance club again? Zeke misses you.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.500
But it's for the wellness of Liberio.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.840
Someday, I'm sure Zeke will
understand why we're doing this.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.640
This is the Tragedy of Lago
that occurred 1,200 years ago.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.940
After Lago was destroyed in a single day,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.150
the Titans went on to cause the Horrors
of Valle and Ravaging of Monte.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.530
Marleyans in the tens of thousands
were killed by Eldia.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.950
What's more, the people who escaped
Lago fled into the countryside.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.000
However, the Eldian Empire
put Titans along the path,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.750
and at daybreak, the Titans
rose and attacked the--

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.880
Yeah, I know. A lot of people died.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.010
Is your father teaching you our actual history?

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.810
He says Eldians did horrible things
to Marleyans, so we have to atone for it.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.600
Do you want to become a Warrior
and fight for Marley?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.400
Yeah. I want to be a Warrior.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.780
Well, I think it's bedtime.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.160
Oh! Next time you're here,
I'll read you the cat house book!

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.660
Yay!

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.710
Begin!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.990
You're awful at this, Dad!

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.370
Dad!

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.540
Zeke?

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.620
I finished early today! Let's--

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.210
Oh, good. We'll be able to study more.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.460
Right...

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.010
In other words, the Tragedy
of Lago never happened.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.220
The Ravaging of Monte and Horrors of Valle
are stories made up by Marley, too.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.350
Eldians have never had such cruel
customs or culture. After all--

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.440
The Founder Ymir wouldn't
want that. It's unthinkable.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.610
That's right! You're catching on, Zeke!

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.990
Yeah!

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.160
If you're not serious, get lost!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.370
Marley needs people willing to
give everything to our motherland.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.540
We sure as hell won't leave a Titan
in the hands of someone like you.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.470
Hey! You there! Can you toss that ball back?

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.770
You've got a good arm for a kid!

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.320
Huh?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.940
Here!

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.990
Nice catch!

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.450
I'm sick of throwing off the wall.
You mind playing for a bit?

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.080
A red armband! You're--!

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.500
One of the Marleyan Warriors
you're aiming to be.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.420
Though, since my Beast Titan
isn't too helpful in war,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.960
I mostly just play catch around here.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.760
The name's Tom Ksaver.
I work in Titan research.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.930
So, what's your name?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.680
Zeke Jaeger!

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.190
Zeke, your throw has some heat!
You'd be a good pitcher.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.450
I'm home! Dad, guess what?

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.490
That's not what you told me!

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.660
What gives, Grice? If Zeke isn't
chosen, the plan's finished!

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:07.090
But the Owl said they can't influence the
decision unless Zeke has decent scores.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.420
I know! A chance like
this comes once a century!

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.050
Doesn't Zeke still have a shot, though?

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.100
Yeah, he might. If Zeke steps up--

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.480
--I'm sorry.
--Zeke!

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.740
I know you can do it!
You're our son, after all!

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.870
I said Marley has no need for you.
Why are you here?

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.170
T-To show my loyalty to Marley
and atone for Eldia's sins!

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.170
Let me in open training, please!

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.480
What are you doing, Jaeger?!
Run! Run, boy!

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.480
Dammit! It's bullshit!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.610
Don't say that! He's trying his best!

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:19.740
He'll never be a Warrior like this!

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.620
You were a mess the other day.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:31.500
It's not funny. They're just having me
run errands now. It's over for me.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.470
Seemed to me that you never
wanted to be a Warrior.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.890
I have to become one, yet I totally failed.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.900
No big deal. It's stupid
for you to be a Warrior.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.650
It's dumb to shorten your life for Marley
and get sent to fight other nations.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.990
Huh?!

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.870
Why did you become a Warrior?

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:05.500
To learn the secrets of Titans.
I'm a researcher, you know.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.710
Everything started when the
Founder Ymir touched "something,"

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.010
but I wanted to know the truth of it all--

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.220
enough to shorten my life
to look through Titan memories.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.810
That's why I'm pretty much
useless when it comes to war.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:30.850
Compared to the mysteries of Titans,
hatred and war seem so trivial.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:37.240
That's why you and I aren't
interested in their war games.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.820
We're just two decent people--
a real rarity in this world.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:52.540
This is for the best. Even if I can't
leave the zone, as long as I'm alive...

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.890
We finally got a lead.
They're the "Eldian Restorationists."

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.890
It's a pretty large group.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:10.850
A traitor called the "Owl" formed it.
We've got a few hunches already.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.980
It's just a matter of time
till we get solid proof.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.070
Zeke?

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.110
What's wrong?

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.820
Eat up.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.700
M-My stomach hurts.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.130
Dad, Mom... Stop doing dangerous things.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.510
If they find out, we'll be sent to paradise--

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:49.310
sent to the island of devils
and made into Titans.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.810
Have you learned nothing I've taught you?

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:58.530
Unless someone takes a stand,
we'll live pitiful lives in this tiny cage.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:05.200
That's right. We're fighting for the
future of all Eldians, including yours.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.410
Even if there's a chance
that I end up like Aunt Fay?

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:16.170
Zeke! The only reason Fay died
is because this world is twisted!

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:20.260
We have to fight so nobody
else ends up like her!

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:25.760
We must restore the strength of Eldia
and win our rights back!

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Titan Research"
"Research concerning the unique power of Subjects of Ymir to become Titans. A field of study since the era of the Eldian
Empire, it encompasses not only the biology
of Titans themselves, but also the ideologies of Eldians who possess the power and how to deal with them. Though researched extensively over many years, the truth of Titans still remains a mystery."

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.610
You're kidding me!

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:42.150
Your parents are Restorationists?!
You'll all be sent to paradise!

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.650
Yeah.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.200
Mr. Ksaver, thanks for playing catch with me.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.210
Even when I'm a Titan, I'll remember you.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.420
Well, goodbye.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.930
Report them.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:05.840
Huh?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.720
It's your only hope!

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.310
If you report them to Marley
and prove your loyalty,

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.310
you and your grandparents might be spared.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.360
I could never do that!

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.780
Zeke! Your parents have been terrible to you!

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:26.530
They gave up on you
and never cared how you felt!

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.700
They... never loved you!

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.330
Zeke, you've done nothing wrong.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:41.050
You're a smart kid. A good kid.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.010
Take it easy on me, Zeke!

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.850
Whoops. Do I throw too hard for a geezer?

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.600
Hey! I'm not that old--!

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.270
Mr. Ksaver!

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.360
It won't be long till my term is over.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.740
Yeah.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.950
I didn't get to grow old,
but I don't regret a life of research.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.120
I'll be able to release a compilation.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.790
Yeah? What about?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.750
The things the Founding Titan
did to the Subjects of Ymir.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.800
Oh. Like rewriting their memories?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.970
Not just memories. It can change
the anatomy of their bodies.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:39.850
Around 600 years ago, a terrible
pandemic devastated the population.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:46.440
But all of a sudden, the disease just
vanished from the Eldian Empire.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:53.080
The King at the time used the Founding
Titan to change how their bodies work.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:59.750
No matter where we go, we Subjects of
Ymir are like part of the Founding Titan.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.250
Scary, right?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:04.960
Then...

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.880
Why are you pumping out more devils?!

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:14.640
Can the Founding Titan make it
so Subjects of Ymir can't bear children?

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.600
If none of us were able to have kids,
Titans would be wiped out in 100 years.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.280
The world wouldn't have to fear
or be threatened by Titans anymore.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:34.160
What's more, if we hadn't been born,
we wouldn't have had to suffer!

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.910
Mr. Ksaver?

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.340
I've never spoken about it,
but I had a family once.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.880
In my foolish youth, I removed my armband.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.350
And hiding the fact I was an Eldian,
I had a wife and child.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.510
My wife was a Marleyan.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:04.020
I knew I couldn't hide it forever,
but when my wife found out I was Eldian,

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.690
she slit my son's throat and her own.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:15.160
Me becoming a Warrior was merely
a grandiose way to commit suicide, but...

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:23.250
For 13 years, I immersed myself in
Titan research, met you, played catch...

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.830
It's been fun.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:32.720
I looked for my dead son in you.
I ran from my sins with my Titan powers!

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.800
If only I hadn't been born in this world!

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.390
I'll inherit the Beast Titan.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:48.860
Not for Marley, but to retake the
Founding Titan and save the world!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.700
I'll free the world from the terror of Titans

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.700
and free all Eldians from suffering!

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:06.880
This is something I haven't told Marley--
a way to break the vow renouncing war.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.960
As luck would have it, it's only
possible because it's you.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.390
If a Titan with royal blood comes
in contact with the Founding Titan,

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.560
it's possible to draw out its power.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:27.400
However, the power isn't yours to use.
That right lies with the Founding Titan.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.230
Essentially, you're the key to the lock.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:36.160
The Founding Titan needs
to be someone you trust.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.950
Someone who understands
our "euthanization" plan.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.660
I know you'll find that someone.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:52.880
I'll always be watching over you, Zeke.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.760
I'll find that someone, Father.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.890
Eren Jaeger?

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.730
Yes. Eren possesses the Founding Titan.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:14.280
And in the basement of his house in Shiganshina
there's some sort of vital information.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.490
Did you hear Eren say
anything about his father?

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.790
I believe he said his father's
missing and used to be a doctor.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.290
Unbelievable! "That" father was alive?

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:37.880
Eren, we're victims.
You've been brainwashed by him.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.140
Someday, I'll come and rescue you!

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.100
You're starting to resemble Father a bit.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.950
First of all, thanks for coming
here to talk with me.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:03.240
My stance is exactly what Yelena told you.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.370
Do you support the Eldian euthanization plan?

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:14.630
Four years ago, some of Dad's
memories opened up to me--

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:19.840
memories of when he slaughtered
the wall's royal family.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.010
He crushed their little kids
and smeared them like bugs.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.520
I felt it, too.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:32.560
If those kids lived, the royal family
would retake the Founding Titan.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:39.950
Bound by the vow renouncing war,
humanity in the walls would be doomed.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.450
Those kids dying is what let us live.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:50.120
I see. So you believe that Father was right?

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.670
No, he was wrong.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:59.050
And I, the son that he raised, was wrong, too.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:03.260
If Eldians hadn't been born, this city--

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.100
these people wouldn't have
to die in this plan of ours.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.440
There's no greater salvation
than never being born in this world.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:20.740
I'll do it. I'll put an end
to 2,000 years of Titan domination.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.780
Until then, I keep moving forward.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.620
Right, Brother?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:34.420
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Let's do it.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:41.630
I wish I could shake your hand, but it's best
that we don't make contact just yet.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.470
So instead, take this.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:50.140
Eren, we're gonna save everyone.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.020
Our sole salvation...

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.910
...is Eldia's euthanization.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.740
You say something? Euthanization?

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.160
You're about to find yourself
in a Titan's mouth,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.420
listening to what it sounds like to be digested.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.630
Compared to how you stole
the lives of my comrades,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.880
it sounds like a pleasant way to die.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.890
I didn't steal... I saved lives.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.350
The lives of the children they would bear...

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:37.270
...from this cruel world.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.230
--Looks like your legs are growing back.
--Isn't that right...

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.860
...Mr. Ksaver?! I hope you're watching!

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.650
The futures they seek are incompatible.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.320
All they can do is clash,
fighting for their beliefs

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.530
in the place it all began, Shiganshina.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "Above and Below."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.490
"Above and Below"
