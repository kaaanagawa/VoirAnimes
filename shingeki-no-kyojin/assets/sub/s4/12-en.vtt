00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.570
Hey!

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.740
You're not allowed to touch the girl, mister.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.950
I-It's not what you think, Hitch! I-I...

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.910
Titan memories have been known
to transfer by touch!

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.790
I thought I might learn something important!

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.090
I wasn't doing anything inappropriate, really!

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.010
You are a guy, after all.
I bet you wanna learn all about Annie.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.020
I'm sorry, okay?!
Don't ban me from coming back!

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.940
I wasn't planning to. Annie would
get bored listening only to me.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.900
Huh?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.820
Unbelievable. You're so popular,
and all you do is sleep.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"Guides"

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.680
It's great that you've got a crush on her,
but have you heard the news?

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.340
No.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.850
Read this.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.400
"Military Clings to Power by
Wrongfully Detaining Eren Jaeger."

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.860
"Distrust in the Military Soars Higher."

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.200
Because they're not giving
the public any answers.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.540
Well, they can't just disclose
Zeke and the rumbling.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.040
Only Eren can save Eldia!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.040
Jaeger's the only one who avenges the eaten!

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880
The New Eldian Empire needs Eren Jaeger!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.760
This is...

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.180
There're citizens surrounding the entire HQ.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.930
Hey, Hitch! Lend us a hand!

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.930
Ugh! More work for me!

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.060
Armin!

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.440
Mikasa! You managed to make it here, huh?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.320
Yeah. We can't let this time
go to waste. Let's go.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.210
Scout recruits? What are they doing at HQ?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.880
That day, I did go to meet Eren.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.420
Oh?

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.840
I'm sorry for keeping quiet about it.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.100
That's enough reason to detain the volunteers.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.730
How kind of you to admit.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.230
The way I saw it, you guys
didn't know the world.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.690
If you kept arguing and putting it off,
it would be too late.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.200
Eren felt the same sense of urgency, too.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.330
So, you convinced Eren to infiltrate
Marley alone to get our military moving?

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.960
Not quite. I said someone needed to
light a fire under the administration.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.010
That's all you said?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.720
You risked a secret meeting without
discussing any concrete plans?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.510
That's right.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.730
Given our position, we weren't allowed
to meet with him in public.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.690
But the risk was worth it to you.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.240
You succeeded in manipulating Eren
just as Zeke hoped you would.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.610
What would be the point in that?

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.120
All I wanted was for Eren Jaeger
to know who I was!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.890
No... We wanted Eren's Founding Titan
to crush Marley into dust.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.930
Just like we hoped,
he inflicted heavy damage to Marley.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.900
No... He exceeded expectations.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.110
He delivered the divine retribution
we wished upon Marley for years.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.820
For him to achieve such things
is proof he possesses the Founder.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.460
Commander Pyxis, do you know
what we're witnessing?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.580
History is about to change before our eyes.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.510
Two brothers are reshaping the world.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.760
I simply want to see it happen from their side.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.470
In other words, the main reason
you met Eren was out of curiosity?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.940
Essentially. The other volunteers
don't know that I secretly met Eren.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940
My actions were reckless.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:32.490
It's true that I deceived you guys,
but I did it for the sake of Eldia.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.330
I'd like to believe you.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.210
Tell me everything you and Eren spoke about.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.580
Do you know how to tell a good lie?

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.960
Sometimes, you've gotta mix the truth into it.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.810
Good grief. It's appalling that people
doubt us after all this time.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:06.110
Aren't we comrades? We sweat
side-by-side these past three years!

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.400
The railways, the trading...
We made this island prosper!

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.570
We gave our everything to Eldia!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:21.830
I'm sorry. It's just ten months after
the rails opened and this happens...

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.630
Tell me about it. Didn't we swear
to work together for the future?

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.340
Wh-What's the matter?!

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:37.180
What? Yelena said she
met Eren in secret? Seriously?

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.600
You really didn't know?

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.480
I-I had no idea. Honestly.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.070
Yeah. It doesn't seem like
you did. To me, at least.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.950
Yelena...

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.700
I notice you're not saying
Yelena would never do that.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.950
Because you know that she might.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.540
That's not...

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:08.170
We've done this backwards, but now
there's reason to detain you guys.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:14.090
Tell me what you know about Yelena
for the sake of our future.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.310
As you know, Yelena organized the volunteers.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.020
At first, people were wary
and it didn't go so well.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:31.650
But she got her hands dirty and proved
her loyalty to Zeke and the group.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.360
There were "accidental" deaths.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.200
We buried friends we ate and slept with.
Anyone who doubted us.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:46.540
But we pushed on for the sake of our
homelands that Marley took away.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.840
Strange.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.710
Huh?

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:54.220
She pressed our government
to give Marleyans certain rights.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.010
You make Yelena sound merciless
to Marleyans, yet on our island...

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.600
All right. I need you to
come with me, Onyankopon.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.980
Huh?

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.570
I hear Hange's all over the place.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.490
Yeah. I guess something needed checking out.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:24.000
Indeed. And I permitted
a volunteer to go along.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.460
I can't allow you two to meet Eren.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.210
Why not?!

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.630
Because we know Eren had
contact with the volunteers.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:44.350
Eren kept quiet about his secret meeting
which resulted in the raid on Marley.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:50.270
We're currently investigating if
anyone else was involved with it.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.860
Eren hasn't said a word
since the truth came to light.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:10:01.240
We're still in the dark about what he did
during his time in Marley, too.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.170
We believe that Eren is
being manipulated by Zeke.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.710
I'm telling you this because it's you two,
but keep quiet about it.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.840
Eren... No way...

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.640
What will happen to Eren?!

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.600
Is that...?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:35.230
Hmm? It's nothing. I had recruits bring it here
since there was nowhere to store it.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:42.570
But, Premier, if Eren isn't talking,
all the more reason I think we can help.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:49.250
I'm not sure we can get the truth out
of him, but there's no harm in trying.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.920
The situation is too delicate.
We're done talking here.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:05.720
Why? You're right that there's no harm
in talking, so why can't we?

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:14.320
One explanation might be that
they've completely given up on Eren.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.120
Excuse us!

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:29.710
If that's true, they're already
picking the next Founding Titan.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.670
I'll listen through the door.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.040
Wait, Mikasa!

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.420
It's fine. I won't get caught.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.210
We can't risk it right now!

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.720
With all that's going on,
we've gotta find out their plan!

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.800
No matter what happens,
I'll make sure Eren...

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.450
Armin! You okay?

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.670
I-I'm fine.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.170
--Put out the fire!
--Was anyone injured?!

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.500
--Over here! We need a hand!
--Hurry up!

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.670
You guys okay?!

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.550
Hitch! What was that?!

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.470
The premier's room just...!

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.050
Where is he?!

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.690
Give your hearts!

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.270
Our anger reached 'em! Now's the time to fight!

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.690
I'll fight, too!

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:38.900
--Me, too!
--And me!

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.700
--Yeah! It's time to fight!
--Let's show 'em how angry we are!

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.700
Give your hearts!

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:54.420
Give your hearts! Give your hearts!
Give your hearts! Give your hearts!

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.460
Give your hearts!

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:07.180
Premier Zachary owned a "special" chair.
We believe a bomb was placed on it.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:13.980
He and three soldiers were lost.
The culprit and their goal is unknown.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.480
The volunteers were on house arrest
and this one was with me all day.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.740
Who else could be responsible for it?

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:28.030
The premier said some recruits
brought it to his room.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.780
Recruits from where?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.540
He never said from where.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:39.170
But when Mikasa and I went to his room,
we saw recruits leaving HQ.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.170
Scout recruits.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:51.310
Speaking of Scouts, I hear some
of them leaked the info about Eren.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.060
--You don't think...
--It's an emergency!

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.770
Eren Jaeger has escaped from his cell!

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.310
Mobilize everyone and find him!

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.110
--Yes, sir!
--Hurry! Let's go!

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.650
--Armin...
--Hurry! Let's go!

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.940
What in the world is happening?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.550
What a crowd. This everyone?

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.180
Besides us here, we have allies
hiding in the military.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.190
Including some who blew up Dhalis Zachary.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:48.200
The only one who can save the
Eldian Empire is you, Eren Jaeger.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.450
It's okay, Mikasa. Eren will understand.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.700
If we talk to him, I'm sure he'll understand.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.960
Find out where Zeke's being kept.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"New Eldian Empire"
"A new name for Eldia used by those on Paradis who are sympathetic to Eren Jaeger's actions. They have rallied around Eren and the name, causing disorder on the island, which is currently divided on whether to attack other nations or not<b>."</b>

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.470
Floch Forster and some 100 soldiers
and guards vanished from the prison.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.770
They're thought to have defected
timed with Eren's escape.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.980
I'm sure they're behind
the premier's murder, too.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:32.110
They need a name. Let's call these
anti-military insurgents "Jaegerists."

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.740
And the goal of the Jaegerists...
is what, Hange?

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.370
They're hoping to bring Zeke and Eren together.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.540
They'll reform the military with Eren on top.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.920
Murdering the premier shows their resolve.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.550
It's obvious what provoked them.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:58.140
The military schemed to take the Founder
from Eren, all without telling us.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.650
We knew what would happen if we had.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.110
In any case, many of the
Jaegerists are from the Scouts.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.440
How will you take responsibility, Hange?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.780
I'll accept any punishment.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.410
But resigning now would be
an irresponsible thing to do.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.670
Besides, we don't know how many
Jaegerists are still in hiding.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.840
Indeed. There might even be a
suicide bomber standing in front of me.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.300
Roeg, don't be ridiculous.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:38.810
Can you be trusted? Until we know,
we can't let you Scouts roam as you please!

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.100
Enough! We have a guest here!

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.230
We have more important things
to do than bicker!

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.650
Hange, who knows where Zeke's being held?

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.950
Levi and the 30 soldiers with him.
Also, three soldiers who deliver supplies.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.950
Lastly, there's me.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.160
Have those three brought here.
Nile, is the Queen's residence safe?

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.000
Only a few know the location,
but I'll check it out.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.380
Eren will attempt to contact
Zeke and Queen Historia.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.590
Protecting those two is an absolute must!

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:16.720
Yes, sir!

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.180
Commander Pyxis!

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:24.310
Now that we've lost the premier,
the only one who can lead us is you.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.600
What do you think we should do?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.990
We've been utterly beaten.
Let's surrender to Eren.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.370
We can't do a thing about enemies in our midst.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:46.290
Even if we flushed them out,
who knows how much blood it would cost?

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.170
We don't have time to waste on such folly.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.050
Our decisions made soldiers
turn their backs on us.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.470
It brought about our defeat.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:01.560
You're kidding! Bow down to
the people who killed the premier?!

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.350
I knew Zachary for many years.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.150
To live and die by revolution
would be what he wanted.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:17.110
Anyways, the four who died wouldn't
want their deaths to cause Eldia's fall.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.530
So instead, we submit to the Jaeger brothers?!

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.580
We're not submitting.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:28.120
We'll use the location of Zeke
to negotiate with the Jaegerists.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:35.130
Like before, Eldia's survival will depend
on a test run of the rumbling.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:41.600
However, we must look past the fact
that they murdered the premier.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:47.020
If that's the price to prevent
countless comrades from being killed...

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.560
...so be it.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.150
Get moving, soldiers!

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.700
Yes, sir!

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.200
Commander.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.330
I'm ashamed you had to see that.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.960
Don't be. Every country goes through this.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.290
I'm afraid I can't guarantee your safety.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.380
Please wait at the port until all this is over.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:21.640
Right. We're hoping for Eldia's victory
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.850
Lady Mikasa.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.770
If anything happens, please escape to my ship.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:34.650
I appreciate your concern, Lady Kiyomi.
However, I am an Eldian.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:40.740
I want the place I was born to have a future.
Don't concern yourself with me.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.330
What are you talking about?
The whole reason we came was for you!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.830
Not our resources?

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:57.000
You don't care who leads the country
as long as the rumbling succeeds, right?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.180
Yes... Unless the rumbling's power is proven,
Hizuru will hang us out to dry.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:10.680
Our investments will go to waste
and the Azumabitos will be done for.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.520
All the more reason I can't rely on you.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.070
The Azumabitos had to adapt
to these turbulent times.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:25.320
Now, we're best known for being
wretched, money-grubbing vixens.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:31.830
Still, we haven't lost our pride in the clan
that your mother passed on to you.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.750
No matter what comes of the country,
we wish to protect you!

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.010
We're helping Eren when he killed the premier?

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.430
Nobody knows if Eren did it.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.770
Keep it down, Mikasa.
People suspect us of being Jaegerists.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.140
Whose side are you on anyways, Mikasa?

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.440
Armin and I almost got caught
in the explosion. You have to ask?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.570
--Huh?
--Enough.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.410
Like Pyxis was saying,
infighting will be our downfall.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.290
So you're okay with entrusting
everything to Eren and Zeke?

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.750
No, it's not good.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:19.750
Zeke and Yelena took precautions and
were ready for this sort of situation.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.880
We have to expect they took
other precautions, too.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.680
We need to figure out Zeke's intentions
before he makes fools of us.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.890
Let's just hope my concerns
turn out to be nothing.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:36.100
Something worrying you?

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.770
Yelena secured work for
Marleyan prisoners in odd places.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.530
Like restaurants, for example.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.070
What a big building!

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.110
I've never seen anything like it!

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.320
Me, either!

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.620
It's yer lucky day, kids!

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.950
Y'all fixin' to eat?

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.330
Yeah!

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.470
Tsk! The military's always in a rush.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.820
Gabi and Falco seek help
from a Marleyan prisoner.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:51.990
Does a rewarding future lie beyond
the truth, or something else?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "Children of the Forest."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.490
"Children of the Forest"
