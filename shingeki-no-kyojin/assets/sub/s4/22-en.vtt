WEBVTT

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.750
I heard Eren's voice!

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.260
My name is Eren Jaeger.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.180
I'm using the Founding Titan's power
to address all Subjects of Ymir.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.180
I've undone the hardening
of Paradis Island's walls

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.560
and the Titans buried within
have begun their march.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.400
My goal is to protect the people
of Paradis Island--the place I was born.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.870
However, the world wants to exterminate
my people--and not just on the island.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.130
They will not stop until every last
Subject of Ymir is dead.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.590
I refuse to let them.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.850
The Wall Titans will trample every inch
of the world beyond this island

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.100
until every last life beyond
our shores is wiped out.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.030
"Thaw"

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.040
What was that strange place?

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.590
Are you all right, Mr. Leonhart?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.760
Yeah... Did you hear that?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.390
The Titans are leaving
that island to come kill us.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.900
Falco!

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.150
Falco! Where are you?! Where'd you go?!

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:49.750
The first Titan transformation knocks
you out and impacts your memories.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.290
He was taken.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.620
By who?! Why?!

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.960
Probably Jean and Conny.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.090
They wouldn't overlook
a life as valuable as Falco's.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.600
Being one of the Nine Titans,
he's too important to--

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.440
Reiner! Did you use all your power?!

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.940
Yeah. My armor came undone somehow
and a piece of the wall hit me real good.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.990
I couldn't stop it.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.580
Huh?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.460
Eren... will destroy the world.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.520
In the south... there're escape airships.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.100
Go find Pieck or our soldiers...
and escape.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:05.490
You have to hurry... and tell Marley.
No, the world.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.080
What will telling them do?
Where's there to run?

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.000
My Mom, Dad, Aunt Karina...
Won't everyone die?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.210
Yes.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.090
We've gotta kill Eren and stop him!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.420
We can't.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:32.680
The Founding Titan can make all Titans
and Subjects of Ymir obey its will.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.150
No one can stop him now.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.150
We can't do anything but run.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.990
Reiner...

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.080
Like hell I'm giving up!

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.210
I'm coming for you, Falco.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.930
It's over.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.690
I never thought he'd slaughter
everyone beyond the walls.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.320
Once they die off, so will all the hate.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.120
Everyone who threatened our
existence will be flattened,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.540
leaving nothing but empty plains.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.290
What the world feared more
than anything has happened.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:48.090
All because they labeled us devils
and tried to slaughter us.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.930
In other words, this is something
they brought upon themselves.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.600
There was nothing we could do, right?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:11.200
But... this is... going too far.
It's genocide of unprecedented scale.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:17.620
Then... do we stop him? Stop Eren?

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.460
Eren opposed Zeke, who wanted to
castrate us with his euthanization plan.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:30.920
He opposed preserving the
Founding Titan by sacrificing Historia.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:39.850
Basically, Eren... He's sacrificing
humanity outside the walls to protect us.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.070
'Cuz there's only one group that
benefits from mass genocide--us.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.860
Because you're important to me.
More than anyone else.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.040
That was...!

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:13.010
The Titans are fighting soldiers?!
Did they eat the whole Marleyan army?!

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:18.430
But why?! If Eren commands the
Founder, can't he control every Titan?!

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.060
Well, they're eating our guys!
Let's help!

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.730
Wait, Jean! What about the kid?

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:33.360
He probably inherited the Jaw Titan.
We can't just leave him here.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.780
But if we feed him to a Titan,
we could save someone.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.870
For example, Commander Pyxis--

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.410
No.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.210
My mom. We feed him
to my mom in Ragako.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.340
All right?

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.890
Conny, Jean... According to Zeke,

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.560
that kid's a Warrior candidate
and he's like their little brother.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:08.900
If we kill someone close to Reiner and
the Cart, it'll only cause more conflict.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:15.450
There's no point in continuing the
bloodshed once Marley has fallen, so--

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.570
You're saying my mom doesn't matter?

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.530
That's not what I--

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:26.620
Do you have any idea what it's been like
to see my mom like that every time?!

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.590
You're only here 'cuz
you ate Bertholdt!

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.090
So don't stop me from
bringing my mom--!

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.300
Conny!

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.770
Hey!

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.690
--Conny!
--Not now!

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:53.610
Shit. We've gotta deal with these Titans.
There ain't any more walls left.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.530
Not good! The fort won't hold!

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.120
The soldiers are dead?!

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.450
Yelena, get back!

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.700
Zeke made these Titans.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.870
Huh?

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.630
Why? Is Zeke not controlling them?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.850
They're here!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.360
We're... doomed.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.860
Run! Use the narrow alleys!

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.780
Kaya! Look out!

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.750
--Kaya!
--No, Mr. Braus!

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.430
Why...? Again...?

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.230
Save me, Big Sis!

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.480
Kaya!

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.670
Kaya! Get up!

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.940
Big... Sis?

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.950
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Anti-Titan Rifle"
"A large-caliber, single-shot rifle developed for use against Titans. Debuting in the surprise attack of Paradis Island, it's powerful enough to bring down a Titan with a hit to its nape, but the rifle's utility is questionable. Its size, weight, and significant recoil make it a liability to the shooter."

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.920
Didn't you flee with the Warrior Unit?
Why are you here?

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.210
I came to rescue Falco.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.460
You mean Ben?

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.170
Hey! Are you guys okay?!

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.010
Did you kill the Titan?!

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:26.180
Where'd you get that weapon?!
Did the girl shoot it?!

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.140
Wait... Are you that
brat invader from Marley?!

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.110
Answer him! Otherwise--!

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:41.190
She's not! We're just a family
that runs the stables!

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.150
Kaya...

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.740
I killed the Titan! Being a former
Marleyan prisoner, I know how to shoot!

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.210
More importantly, how about
y'all get us to a safe place?!

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.870
Save us, misters!

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.130
--Please, misters!
--Please, help us!

00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.800
--You guys...
--Please, misters!
--Please, help us!

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.380
--Please! We're begging you!
--Take us somewhere safe!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.800
Fine! We'll go around the flames.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:15.940
Listen, Mia. You find Ben and run.
But till then, behave and come with us.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.650
Okay.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.030
Did you guys see that daydream, too?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:28.070
Yeah. Are them Wall Titans
really trampling the world?

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.740
Yeah, seems that way.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.670
Why did you protect me?

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:47.800
You, too. Why did you save me?
You even risked your life.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.220
Who knows?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:58.770
I tried to kill you.
I'm... a devil, right?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.320
No... I'm the devil.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:12.990
I've killed lots of people...
just to earn praise.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.960
That's... the devil in me.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.920
There's one in me, too.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.460
And in Kaya. And everyone else.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.840
The world is like this
'cuz there's a devil in all of us.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.180
Then what should we do?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.430
Escape the forest.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.440
Even if we can't, we've gotta keep trying.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.610
--Help me!
--Surma!

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.330
Surma!

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:04.800
I don't remember teaching you guys to
whimper and cry when you see a Titan!

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.430
Put on ODM gear!
There's some of the old design left!

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.430
If you wanna live,
get off your asses and follow me!

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.140
Commandant Shadis!

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.700
Anyone alive in there?!

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:40.040
Everyone, get to the top floor!
We'll hit the Titans when they gather!

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.460
Bring all the Thunder Spears you've got!
We'll handle 'em somehow!

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.050
Don't let the Titans wander off!

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:52.590
If you care about your former
comrades, let's lay them to rest!

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.730
Together, everyone!

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:12.030
Fire!

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.250
Here they come! Pull back!

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.510
This way!

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.470
Don't worry about fighting!
Lead 'em to the fort!

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.870
Commander Pyxis...

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.720
Let's go.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.350
Mmm.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:28.400
Commander... A big reason we
made it this far... is you.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.360
May you rest in peace.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.380
The fires have settled down.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:38.550
Marley's army was basically wiped out,
and there're no more Pure Titans.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.010
For now, we're safe.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.810
I see.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:49.100
It's about time you told us
about the daydream.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.520
What is Eren trying to do?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.030
You're looking at it.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.410
I see.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.290
Is my homeland doomed as well?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.710
Floch! Are you okay?!

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.920
While I was nearly dying
thanks to the wall,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.170
it looks like you took care
of the Titans, Jean.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.630
You lived?

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.850
Yeah. Thanks for your concern.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:30.730
I can't kick the bucket just yet.
Eldia's restoration is finally at hand.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:42.660
Yelena, assemble the Volunteers.
You're being detained.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.370
What?!

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.620
I'm glad you're okay, Mr. Braus.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:56.380
I'm glad y'all are safe, too.
Sorry to bother you for this.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.670
You're...! Why are you...?

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.550
Believe me, I don't want
any more trouble.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:07.390
All I want is to get Falco back.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.930
I promise we'll disappear for good!

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.190
Falco... Where is he?!

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:28.540
You're kidding. He took Falco
to feed to his Titan mother? Why?

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:35.420
Since Conny's mother was the only one
there unable to move, there she stayed.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.880
--For four years, Conny's been
going back to visit her.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.800
--Four years...
--For four years, Conny's been
going back to visit her.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.850
I-I'm... sorry.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:55.230
Even so, I can't give up on Falco.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.650
Please! Can't Eren Jaeger turn
Conny's mother back to normal?!

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.910
Can't the Founder do anything?!

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.490
I don't know. But if he could,

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:13.370
I think he would've done so to the
soldiers Zeke made into Titans.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.460
If you don't know,
why don't you ask him?!

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.510
Does everyone off the island really
have to die?! They shouldn't have to!

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:27.720
Ask him why he can't just
destroy all the military bases!

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.600
Seeing how he stripped Reiner
of his armor, I don't see why not!

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.810
Where is Reiner?

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.770
Does that even matter?!
He's too injured to move!

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:43.690
When did Reiner's hardening come
undone? When? At what point?

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.700
As soon as the walls collapsed.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.200
Armin?

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:56.370
If Eren meant he would undo
all the hardening...

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.860
They were once friends and once enemies.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.900
Time that stopped resumes,
changing everything.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.490
Now, a choice must be made.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:56.370
Next episode: "Sunset."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.490
"Sunset"
