WEBVTT

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.610
So much for that.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.320
Why'd it come to this?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.740
Nothing can take the violence
out of people. Right, Captain?

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.450
You traitors! Why?!

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.080
Aren't we all friends?!

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.670
You are our friends!

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.920
But...! I...!

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.090
J-Just now... What did you say?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.930
That it usually takes us a whole day
to service the boat before it can fly.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.850
But with the right equipment,
we could shave it down to half a day.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.230
Half a day?

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.690
You want us to hold off
the enemy for that long?

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.400
They're gonna be throwing
reinforcements at us.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.740
We're supposed to defend the port
when our Titans only last a few hours?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.030
We'll be too late.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.870
The rumbling moves faster
than a galloping horse.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.500
Plus, they plow through all obstacles.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.680
In half a day, they'll raze something
like 600 kilometers past the coast.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.520
For them to flatten the entire
continent will take... just four days.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.650
Even if all goes right
and we do stop Eren...

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.950
...it'll already be
too late... for Liberio.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.200
Dammit.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.920
Even if we do get it to fly,
we don't know Eren's location.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.710
That'll add more time.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.010
It's not like we can defend the
port that long to begin with.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.390
It's just not...

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.600
I have an idea.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.610
South of here, in the Marleyan coastal
city of Odiha, we own a hangar.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.030
The flying boat could be serviced there.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.410
We could depart at once,
towing it behind us,

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.660
and complete preparations in Odiha.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.750
A coastal city? That puts it roughly...
Isn't it about to be flattened?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.170
We can get to Odiha
before the rumbling does,

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.890
but it's a gamble if it'll
stand for half a day.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.510
A gamble...

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.150
In any case, we won't
be taking off from here.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.560
Does the ship have coal?

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.650
Y-Yes!

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.780
But prep takes 30 minutes!

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.990
Make it 15! If you die, Hizuru and
the world are doomed! Stay sharp!

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.450
--Right!
--Right!

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.450
I'll get Captain and the others!

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.750
I'll let Mikasa know!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.930
"Retrospective"

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.810
Eat this!

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.030
Change of plans! We're leaving to
service the boat on the mainland!

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.240
On the mainland...?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.120
Help 'em board it!

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.420
Go! Go!

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.050
It's the Azumabito mechanics! Kill 'em!

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.110
You damn traitors!

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.330
Where are the Azumabito going?
What could be worth the risk?

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.870
You don't think...?!

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.870
Reiner!

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.300
Take this!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.760
Go! Go!

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.400
Forget the Female Titan!
Get the Azumabito!

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.620
Stand up! We're nearly to the ship!

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.580
Outta the way!

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:16.930
Shoot! Are they seriously gonna
service it on the mainland?!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.430
Bring all the Thunder Spears!

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:27.310
They're taking the ship to kill Eren!
We've gotta sink it at all costs!

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.440
If Eren dies, Paradis will drown
in a sea of blood!

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.830
The world will seek revenge and butcher
your parents, siblings, and children!

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.080
Give your hearts!

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.580
You're kidding!

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.250
Huh?!

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:56.640
They're aiming for the boat. At this rate,
those two won't last till it's ready.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:05.600
I've gotta fight, too.
I can use the Jaw's power.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.610
Bad idea. The first
transformation never goes well.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.530
But if this goes on...!

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:18.320
Leave it to me. After I get you
guys to the ship, I'll join the fight.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.990
If only Galliard was here instead of me...

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.880
He wouldn't sit around
worrying about what to do!

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.590
Falco, wait!

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.090
Don't!

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.340
I've gotta get you to the ship.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.560
Get in! Hurry and light the boiler!

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.560
Conny!

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.100
He's hit in the chest.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.780
And face, but he'll heal up soon.
Can you--?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.490
I'll guard the ship!

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.120
Commander Magath, Falco has...

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.620
Tsk!

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.800
Reinforcements!

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.680
Unless we do something about 'em,
we'll be dying instead of leaving.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:34.400
The whole train of reinforcements...
was taken out!

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.660
What are you doing, Falco?!
Get on the ship!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.870
Right!

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.850
My body... won't move!

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.810
I can't... see a thing!

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.440
Now! Finish 'em off!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.070
Conny!

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.740
Die, you traitor!

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.410
Conny!

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.920
Hesitate...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.470
...and we'll never stop the rumbling!

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.520
Floch!

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.310
I know! Take down the
traitors with our ODM gear!

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.230
Nail the Cart with Thunder Spears!
Attack together!

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.290
For crying out loud!

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:24.680
Defend our island to the death!
Our country!

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.890
Huh?

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.990
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Enemies and Allies"
"When Titans were the greatest threat, Titans were the enemy. When countries were the greatest threat, countries were the enemy. For as long as people hold firm to different beliefs, there will always be an enemy."

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:44.610
Falco!

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.960
Falco!

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.840
Now! They broke formation!

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.170
It's now...

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.670
...or never!

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:21.730
Dammit!

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.880
It all comes down to this!
If I can put a hole in the hull...!

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.300
The one who will save Eldia... is me!

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.280
Floch!

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.250
We can set sail! Come aboard!

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.290
Let's go before they
decide to come back!

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.810
Falco!

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.640
The enemies are gone! Come out--!

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.650
Pieck! Hold Falco still!

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.410
Falco!

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.090
You're all right now.
Falco, you did well.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.730
--Take him.
--Sure.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.810
--Leave at once.
--Huh? What about you?

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.150
I'll hold the rear.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.790
Commander brought Falco back.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.800
Yeah. That was a close call.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.010
So? Where's Commander Magath?

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.470
It's "General" now.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.850
It's the enemy! Not all of 'em left!

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.080
Are you the one who took
out the reinforcements?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.870
That's right.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.250
Why didn't you board the ship?

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:14.220
That there's a captured Marleyan cruiser.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:23.140
It's fast enough to catch their ship
and sink it, so I can't just leave it here.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.270
I'll give you a hand.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.900
Here they come.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:40.410
I don't care. I'm lighting
up the magazine.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.790
Now's your last chance to take a swim.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:49.250
No thanks. I've been looking
for a good time to die.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.630
Why did you side with us?
It might be the island's downfall.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.560
I saw some old students of mine
heading south out of Shiganshina...

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.900
...with Annie Leonhart.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:13.230
And when I realized their plan,
my heart was moved...

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.650
...by how much they've grown.

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:23.410
If you hadn't stopped those
reinforcements, we'd have been goners.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.580
You'll soon be known as one
of the heroes who saved the world.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.290
Then... that makes two of us.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.180
I refuse to pat myself on the back.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:46.480
Ignoring my conscience, I ordered around
children to serve the country's interests

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.850
and commanded them to destroy the wall.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:57.900
But I finally realized:
If those kids can live normal lives...

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.530
...how happy that would make me.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.420
Well, you might not pat yourself
on the back, but I'm proud of you.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.800
Open up! Hey! Open this door!

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.340
--What are you doing?!
Open it! Open it, dammit!

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.140
--I'm sure those kids would agree.
--What are you doing?!
Open it! Open it, dammit!

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.640
Thank you.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.310
By the way, what's your name?

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:32.690
Keith Shadis. And you?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.690
Theo Magath.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.950
We decided with Magath
to head for Odiha.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:52.910
Rather, we had no other choice.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:59.500
There's nothing we can do
to save your hometown, Liberio.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:13.560
If that's true, my entire
reason for fighting is gone.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.650
I'm getting off the ship.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.320
Even if the rumbling
stopped in its tracks,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.320
Liberio and Marley's
destruction was inevitable.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:36.000
Magath understood that, but he
gave his life so we could push ahead.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.710
He didn't do it for Liberio or Marley.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:47.970
He did it entrusting us to save people
whose names he'd never know.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:55.060
In that case, I'll ask you again:

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.060
Can you kill Eren?

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.070
If I... try to kill Eren...

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.860
...can you... stand by and watch?

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:22.290
I'm sick of killing each other.
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.260
Not you guys...

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.010
Not even Eren.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.150
The things seen that day...
The things they talked about...

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:52.610
The choices made that day...
Everything had been willed by him.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.490
Next episode: "The Dawn of Humanity."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.490
"The Dawn of Humanity"
