WEBVTT

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.940
I never imagined Floch would
take action this quickly.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:32.030
It's over if the Jaegerists destroy
the flying boat. So why haven't they?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:40.990
Beats me. They probably doubt we're still
around, let alone trying to stop Eren.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.500
It's easy enough to destroy it,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.040
but it'll take decades to restore
the tech with most of the world gone.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.920
Plus, they'll want it to ensure
the mainland is empty.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.340
I think the reason they're here

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.850
is to capture the Azumabito
with all their boats and stuff.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.230
But the moment they realize
we're here at the port,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.440
they'll blast the flying boat
into smithereens.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.910
Preventing that will be difficult,
even with some of the Nine.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.910
But if we can't manage this much,
we'll never take down the Founder.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.830
Let's plan to--

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.980
Traitor

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.320
We've gotta kill 'em all at once.
That's the only way to secure the flying boat.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.790
For this to work, we'll need all our
Titans and all your weapons. Got it?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.340
Not so fast.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.090
What?

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.510
If we go in recklessly,
the Azumabito will get caught up in it.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.510
Right!

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.890
Why should we care about your distant
relatives? They attacked our homeland.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.730
Wait. The Azumabito dying
will pose problems, Annie.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.650
Isn't that right?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.160
It's true. I should be able to
pilot the flying boat on my own,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.910
but without the Azumabito mechanics,
it's just a boat without wings.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.750
Currently, the wings are folded up
to make it easier to tow.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.300
And it's not just a matter
of unfolding the wings.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.930
The original plan was to service it in
the hangar and pilot it after some training.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.400
How long will that take?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.980
I don't know. It depends on the Azumabito.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:52.410
I see. Sounds like you wanna protect the
Azumabito while they service the boat.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:00.340
But not just that--without killing any of
the Jaegerists who come to stop us, huh?

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.680
If possible. We've known 'em
since we were cadets.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.770
So, what's your plan? Tell me.
How do you plan on buying enough time

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.440
for the Azumabito to service the
flying boat without killing anyone?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:27.780
Let's hear it, Armin. Don't you have a
grand plan like when you cornered me?

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:39.170
There's no such plan. We either
wipe 'em out, or don't and lose the boat.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.300
Hold up! We're here to save people!

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.390
And yet, we've gotta murder some of
our friends first?! What the hell?!

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.480
True... You guys shouldn't be expected
to help out in this operation.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.780
Nor expected to make
that choice in the first place.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:16.910
Unlike us, you probably wouldn't
have destroyed the wall that day.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.000
Like I thought, I'm the same as you.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.630
Is that... what he meant...?

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.220
You guys don't have to fight.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.180
Eh?

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.680
Watch from a safe place
with Gabi and Falco.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.520
If the Jaegerists spot you,
you'll have no choice but to fight.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.190
So, stay out of it.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.660
And just watch you guys
slaughter each other?

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.700
Is this even a situation that
Titans alone can solve?

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.580
I have no intention of spectating.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.960
After all, the Jaegerists
have killed four already.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.800
Besides, humanity doesn't
have much time left.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.260
I saw Titans crossing the sea,
giving off tons of steam.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.400
Judging by their speed,
they've probably set foot on Marley.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.650
I'm sure the closest cities in the
northeast are already destroyed.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.740
Who knew they'd cross
the sea so quickly?

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.030
Just how many have died thus far?

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.130
Tell us where Eren Jaeger is headed!

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.590
Talk or I'll give you
another elbow to bend!

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.310
Magath!

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.480
Don't be scared. I won't kill you.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.030
That's a relief.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:19.620
I changed my mind. I don't wanna
die till I see how this ends.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:26.710
If you take me with you, I might
just say where Eren is headed.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.960
Securing the boat comes first.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.590
We don't have time to torture her.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.240
Conny, Armin, Mikasa, Jean...

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:03.160
I want to apologize for my behavior
last night. We... were wrong.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.670
I was foolish to bring up justice.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:13.670
Disgusting as it is, I was desperately
trying to justify my actions.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:20.640
I feared to look at myself and see
I've become as vile as Marley.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.180
None of you are to blame.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.860
It's wrong to make you bear the
sins of the past due to your race.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.780
Pieck, Annie, Reiner...

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:41.830
You shouldn't have to endure the
world's hatred your whole lives, either.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.540
However, it's our duty to remember
this stupid, bloodstained history

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.840
and teach it to future generations.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:58.380
Eren Jaeger wants to eradicate
everything, and that's unforgivable.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:04.720
This hell won't end until we turn
away from all this senseless killing.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.100
But... please...

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:16.360
Just this once, look the other way
until this senseless bloodshed is over.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.290
I refuse.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.170
I won't stand by with clean hands.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.640
Just look at all that steam!

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.900
We'll never see a day where
history changes more!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.780
Of course, that includes Hizuru's, too.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:04.580
Civilization will be completely erased
and all lands born anew.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.620
You need not worry
about things anymore.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.330
Just focus on contributing to the island.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:22.140
Fortunately, you have Hizuru's finest
engineers here to do their part. Right?

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:28.430
If you don't want to lose any more
of them, just do as you're told.

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.650
Sorry to spoil your
wonderful mood, but...

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.690
Eh?

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:39.570
What "change" are you so happy about?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:46.200
If you think Paradis Island will be
safe now, I'm afraid you're wrong.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.210
The world will shrink, that's all.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.290
You'll still continue to kill
one another, as always.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.850
Thanks for your thoughts.
I'm starting to think that, too.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.310
But it's very important
to know one's place.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.520
We don't need Hizuru's technology.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:21.570
If we decide seafaring and
flying boats don't matter much to us,

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.240
we'll nip trouble in the bud. Got it?

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.580
It's important to know
one's place. Understand?

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.420
Floch! Where are you?!

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.800
Where are the Azumabito?!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.050
Armin?!

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.210
Floch!

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.300
Why all the commotion?!
Where've you been?!

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.510
Chasing the Cart Titan!

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.260
It's with the Armor!
They're swimming away!

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.390
Hurry or they'll escape!
We need the flying boat!

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.520
Order the Azumabito to get it ready!

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.900
What are you--?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.860
What are you doing?!
Why didn't you chase the Cart?!

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:13.200
It's obvious they'd run south!
They... killed Jean and Onyankopon!

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.170
Armin! There's the flying boat!

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.510
Floch! Send the Azumabito
mechanics out here, pronto!

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.810
--Stop!
--Halt!

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.060
Daz! Samuel! What are you doing?!

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.190
Are those explosives?!

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.700
Take those off!

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.490
We need it to stop the Marleyans!
They'll get away!

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.410
--Wait!
--Calm down, you two!

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.420
The truth is, we heard you
guys teamed up with Marley

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:04.630
and wanna use the flying boat
to stop the rumbling, supposedly...

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.840
Th-That's crazy talk!

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.890
Yeah! If Eren's stopped,
the island is doomed!

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.310
Th-That's what I thought.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:23.650
You guys wouldn't put the island in
danger after we're finally saved, right?

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.900
Of course not!

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:30.950
Thank goodness. I don't know what
I would've done if you were traitors.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.540
Just hurry up and take
the explosives off!

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.210
You know, despite the
fact they're our enemies,

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:52.640
part of me thought you guys might try
to stop Eren from killing everyone.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.320
What's wrong?
I disconnected the detonator.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:16.910
Now, if Floch actually listens and
lets the Azumabito mechanics come...

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:22.880
And we somehow get everyone aboard
once the flying boat is ready...

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.960
If all goes to plan,
no blood needs to be spilled.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.010
Information Available for Public Disclosure
Flying Boat
Hizuru technology must be used to service the world's first flying boat, which uses Iceburst Stone as fuel. Since it was designed to observe the might of the rumbling, the craft is capable of long-distance, intercontinental flight.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:39.270
Don't you think it's a little strange?

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:47.530
If they knew the enemy fled south,
a locomotive would get here faster.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.490
Much faster than using horses, at least.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.790
So why would they be sneaking around?

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:04.130
No, there's no proof... But...

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.550
Trouble should be nipped in the bud.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.270
We failed!

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.360
--Huh?!
--Floch!

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.490
Kill her, dammit!

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.030
I won't go down without a fight!

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.210
Kiyomi!

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:56.140
Enemy attack! Mikasa, Armin, and Conny
have betrayed Eldia! Kill them!

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.230
They'll shoot through the window!

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.600
Run to the basement!

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.660
It's begun...

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.370
We've got no choice but
to wipe out the Jaegerists!

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.080
Lady Mikasa!

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.840
This way, Azumabito!
Hunker down in the basement!

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.420
Follow me if you wanna live!

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:47.400
Hey...!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.610
Daz! Stop!

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.690
--Armin!
--Don't move!

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.490
Samuel...

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:09.790
Daz... Blow up the flying boat. Hurry!

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.210
Samuel, you--

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.550
You betrayed us, Conny!

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:26.930
Even though you said we'd expand
our lands and eat meat together!

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.980
Argh, dammit! Why'd it come to this?!

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.410
We're sitting ducks here!
They'll kill us one by one!

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:53.670
It's fine! If we're in a safe place,
the others can let loose!

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.420
They're in the basement!
Bring more explosives!

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.690
They holed up with no escape?!

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.410
No... Could this be...?!

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.960
So much for that.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.800
Why'd it come to this?

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:47.770
Nothing can take the violence
out of people. Right, Captain?

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.010
Fetch more Thunder Spears!

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.320
Daz! Blow it up!

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.330
Armin!

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.920
Stop!

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.430
S-Stop!

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.510
Armin!

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.270
You traitors! Why?!

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.890
Aren't we all friends?!

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.690
You are our friends!

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:22.780
But...! I...!

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.870
Someone has to be the one to do it.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.390
S-Sto--!
