00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.520
Hey! You okay, Oliver?! Hang in th--!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.660
That's the last of the pursuers, Levi.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.760
Everyone got turned into Titans
and only you survived.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.100
Probably for the same reason you're not
dead yet: because you're an Ackermann.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.620
But what to do now?

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.040
We can't stop Zeke anymore, so it's
up to Armin or Commander Pyxis.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.050
Even supposing that Eren
does betray Zeke,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.050
if the Jaegerists control
the island with spinal fluid,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.550
we'll be fugitives
for the rest of our lives.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.480
Looks like my turn has come...
Even if I thought I did the right thing.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.030
Times change and you end up in a cell.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.660
What do you say we live out
here forever? Huh, Levi?

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.790
That was...! No way...! Eren's gonna...?!

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.250
Levi!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.800
The Beast... Where'd that shithead go?

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.680
Lie back down.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.430
It's been half a day since Zeke
and the Jaegerists left for Shiganshina.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.350
What happened?

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.860
I botched it. He was fully prepared
to die... and I didn't see it.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.570
He got away again.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.780
That's unfortunate, but right now--

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.290
If we run and hide, what will be left?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.040
Wha--? I guess you overheard
me talking to myself.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.590
What... are you building? You gonna
pull me on that... with a horse?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.390
There's no way in hell you can
stay out of the action.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.730
Yeah, you're right. I can't.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.110
My goal... is to kill Zeke.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.700
Looks like our interests align,
Theo Magath... Pieck Finger.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.580
Levi Ackermann. It seems you can
stand up to one of the Nine, but...

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.050
How do you plan on
dodging a bullet like that?

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.760
I can't dodge a bullet, but I've
come before you in this sad state.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.810
Whether you shoot or listen is up to you.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:42.070
Then I'll ask this first: You say you'll
kill Zeke, but where is he now?

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.280
Zeke's probably being held by Eren
to make use of his royal blood.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.290
No, by the Founding Titan.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.630
It seems the Titan expert Hange knows
everything--even more than Marley.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.710
Have you seen the Founding Titan?

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.430
I know it's so humongous that it
seems like nothing can be done, so...

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.980
We've got no other choice.
We've gotta put our powers together.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.990
"Pride"

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.780
How exactly do I get my mom to
eat Falco? Just do it by force?

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.710
If he's hurt and finds out about
his Titan powers, it's over.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.090
I can't afford to fail.
I've gotta think of a better way.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.760
What an innocent kid.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:56.640
He hasn't whined once about camping
out here with every reason to doubt me.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.650
Does he seriously trust me?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.360
Dammit! Sasha...
Would you have understood?

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:21.120
Um, I thought we were going to
a hospital, not a deserted village.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.420
Yeah. There's something
interesting here I wanna show you.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.090
This... is Ragako Village!

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.470
Eh?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.680
How do you... know that?

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.440
Last night, I heard you
talking to yourself.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.230
Sasha was your comrade shot by
Gabi on the airship, wasn't she?

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:56.280
You brought me here knowing
who I was but pretending not to.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.370
Why? To get revenge... on me?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:07.250
No. Stuff like that happens
in the heat of battle.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:26.270
Don't worry, it can't move.
It's been like this for years.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.950
What... were you gonna do...
after showing me this?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.090
Can you help me brush the Titan's teeth?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.760
You don't get a chance
like this every day.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.390
Huh?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:06.190
We've gotta go way up there to brush.
Let's climb up and take a look.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.610
Sounds good, right?

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.150
Right...

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.570
Falco! Get away from him!

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:14.400
Gabi?!

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.990
He's gonna feed you to the Titan!

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.950
Huh?!

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.700
Conny! Stop!

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.950
Stay back! Don't come near us!

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.420
Conny!

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:32.050
Shuddap! I don't wanna hear it!
Don't talk! You wouldn't get it!

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.800
You're just gonna say to give up
on my mom and let him live!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.640
A know-it-all wouldn't
get how idiots work!

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.730
Falco! Use the Jaw's power!

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.480
The Jaw's power? Huh?
What about Galliard?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.360
You can't...! Stop! Falco!

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.660
Gabi, please forgive Conny.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.120
Huh?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.920
Hey! I said to stay back!

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.640
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.060
Say something, Armin!

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.650
You told me not to talk!

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.990
So... I'll let my actions talk.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.390
My brother...

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.850
What was your plan if I hadn't saved you?

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.360
To turn your mom back into a human.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.990
And inherit the Colossal Titan.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:24.370
If you thought for a second,
you know that'd only make her suffer.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:31.420
When my mom sent me off,
she said to be a splendid soldier.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:37.760
And yet, her son almost
killed a kid and a friend.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.630
That's the kind of soldier I am.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.060
Me, too. I couldn't stack
up to the commander.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.990
Armin... I wanna be a soldier
my mom could take pride in.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.290
So, let's go save people in trouble.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Ragako Village"
"A village that was deserted after being overrun by Titans. Upon their arrival, the Scouts discovered a single Titan with extremely small limbs which made it unable to move. Later, when Titans were being eradicated from the island, former Ragako resident Conny Springer
requested for the village to become
a 'Titan Observation Zone' and be left as-is."

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.590
I found you.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.590
I'm glad.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:30.520
Did you come looking for me?
Or... for this scarf?

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.980
I knew you would have it.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:39.020
I'm sorry. I thought it'd
bring me closer to you.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.780
I have Thunder Spear shrapnel
in me that they can't remove.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:55.040
It's a pity I won't be able to see the
free world that Eren Jaeger creates.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:04.090
It wasn't much, but I had the chance
to speak with him... about you.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.970
He talked about wanting
to throw the scarf out.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.850
So, rather than throw it out,
I thought I'd just...

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.480
Give it back.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:28.030
I became a soldier because I admired you.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.040
I have no regrets.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:42.340
Because I gave my heart and my life
following in your footsteps.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.100
Is that the last of the rumbling Titans?

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.640
Finally, an end to all this noise.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.650
To me, it sounds like
the bells of freedom.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:10.120
Our Eldian Empire has endured the
world's persecution for 100 years!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.950
That ends now! Now, we are free!

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:21.290
Our liberator, Eren, and we Jaegerists
have triumphed over the world!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:29.930
Say, Mikasa. Will you join the
Jaegerists and rule as one of 'em?

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:31.300
Not interested.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.060
Looks like Jean made up his mind.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.930
Give your hearts!

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.770
--Give your hearts!
--Give your hearts!

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.350
Give your hearts!

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.150
--Give your hearts!
--Give your hearts!

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.070
Give your hearts!

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.530
--Give your hearts!
--Give your hearts!

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.570
Long live the Jaegerists!

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.570
Give your hearts!

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.660
This one's for Eren!

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.740
We should hurry and see Reiner.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.290
It's okay, he'll be out for days.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.880
Is this detour a good idea?

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.550
We've gotta fill our stomachs.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.090
You think it's true, Armin?

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:14.640
Mmm. If all hardening has come
undone, it's likely that Annie has--

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.600
A-Annie?!

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.230
--Huh?
--Eh?

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.900
Huh?

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:30.650
Annie's stuffing her face with pie!

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.990
Cut it out, Conny.

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.740
She eats like a pig!

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.700
It's her first pie in years!

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.500
Sorry! The line took forever and--

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.840
She's gone.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:53.550
"Dear Hitch. I ran into Armin and Conny
and decided to join them.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.890
I'm going ahead. Sorry for the trouble.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.690
Thanks for talking to me these
past four years. Goodbye.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.520
Your gloomy roommate."

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.790
Good grief. I can't finish this alone.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.420
Comrades of the Empire,
thank you for gathering!

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.010
We will now execute two Volunteers
who opposed the Eldian Empire!

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:37.760
With this, we shall carry on Eren's
will to dominate the world...

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.390
...by declaring our reign
over Paradis Island!

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.020
This criminal is Yelena!

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.900
The real reason she rebelled from Marley
and supported the Eldian Empire

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.280
was so Zeke could obtain
the Founding Titan's power

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.580
and wipe out Eldians with
their euthanization plan!

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.870
--In the end, she's a filthy Marleyan!
--Yeah!

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.710
Eren managed to beat
Zeke and halt the plan,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.510
but this criminal served
as Zeke's loyal pawn!

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.720
You whore!

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.260
Send her to hell!

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.140
Yelena... Have any last words?

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.100
Aren't you gonna shoot?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.480
Die, mainlander!

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.560
The Subjects of Ymir will prevail!

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.610
Ymir's bloodline will last forever!

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.860
Shoot her! Shoot her!
Shoot her! Shoot her...!

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.120
Not yet!

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.080
This criminal is Onyankopon.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.760
He aided Eldia without knowing of
the euthanization plan, however...!

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.760
He said he'd rather die than
live under the Eldian Empire!

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.720
It's not too late to change your mind--

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:10.610
I aided Eldia to save my homeland from
Marley, but I was helping you, too!

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.780
And what did that get me?

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:19.700
My homeland will be crushed
and my family massacred!

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:24.750
And the only ones left will
be you xenophobic shits?

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.380
Sucking up to you guys
for life isn't worth it!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:35.840
Even you should know how
insane indiscriminate killing is!

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.140
Why don't any of you understand?!

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.430
Don't just stand there!
Say something, Jean!

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.990
Huh? Hey!

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.790
Whoops. I missed.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.370
Hey, what's the big idea?

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.290
Floch!

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.430
It's the Cart Titan!

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.060
--They got away!
--Jean got eaten!
--And Yelena!

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.020
Shit! Where's Mikasa?!

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.560
Have her... go after...!

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.280
Where... is Mikasa?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.860
Hear that?

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:44.370
Four gunshots in a row--
Jean's signal to continue the plan.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:47.240
We've got enough weapons and food!

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.040
All their eyes will be on the
other side of the fort. Let's go!

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.930
Someone's watching us!

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.020
What now, Armin?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.650
Gotta keep going! Hurry, Mikasa!

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:27.870
I ain't ever going in a
Titan's mouth again!

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:33.920
The Cart can stay a Titan for months,
right? Don't you brush your teeth?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.540
That's a rude thing to ask a lady.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.590
When did you partner with Marley?

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.340
Last night.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:49.770
Why? If you stayed a Jaegerist,
you'd have everything you wanted.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.690
I wish I could've plugged my ears
and stayed cooped up in that room.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:04.320
But then, those ashy bones
would never forgive me.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:11.040
Jean... I don't quite follow, but thanks.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.830
Just wash off already.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.750
Why... me?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:23.800
Securing you was part of the deal
for us to borrow the Cart's power.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.050
They wanted you alive.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.150
Get up.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.900
Annie!

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.370
Calm down, Reiner!

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.540
Don't worry! They're our allies!

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.750
There's not much time. Let's go.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.580
Where to?

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.220
To save the world.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.320
Enemies are made in the chaos of war.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.690
We hated, loathed, and killed one another.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.410
What lies beyond the campfire?

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.420
Next episode: "Night of the End."

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.490
"Night of the End"
