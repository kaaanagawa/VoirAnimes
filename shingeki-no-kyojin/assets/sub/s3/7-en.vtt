00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.990
"Wish"

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.080
At last, there's nobody here but us.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.240
Father...

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.320
Sorry to make you wait.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.400
Listen, Historia...

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.050
This may sound very strange to you,
but Frieda is not entirely dead.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.380
Eh?

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.880
The memories of Frieda still live on.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.010
Would you like to meet your sister?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.140
Yes!

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.150
Understand, Eren!?

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.820
You'll be the one to avenge your mother!

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.470
They got in?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.130
That's...

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.970
What are those?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.180
Fire arrow?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.360
Gunpowder?!

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.320
By the burning pattern, they must
have scattered bags full of oil...

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.700
This could get ugly!

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.950
Here they come!

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.950
Shoot 'em down!

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.660
Smoke signal shells?!

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.960
Tsk! We'll never hit a 
thing in all this smoke.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.170
Twenty-four.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.260
Thirty-two.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.720
Thirty-five enemies!

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.550
They're gathered behind the pillars!

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.720
Continue the plan!

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.720
We'll take 'em all out right here!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.600
All troops, spread out!
Surround them one at a time!

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.450
More smoke?!

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.570
Shit! Where'd they go?!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.540
A big weakness of the
Anti-Personnel ODM gear is...

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.660
...their line of fire and anchor trajectory
are both faced in the same direction.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.140
In other words, the area directly behind
them is completely out of their reach.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.350
Over there! Fire!

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.270
I missed?!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.280
Where are they?!

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.870
You're mine!

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.500
Sasha!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.000
Conny! Hide in the smoke and fight!

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.510
Take this!

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.640
Shit!

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.060
But their greatest weakness is...
once they've fired off two shots...

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.730
...it takes a while for them to reload.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.320
This ain't looking good.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.860
The hell's with that girl?!

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.120
When they manage to get this close,
swords have the advantage!

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.880
We've gotta stop 'em!

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.270
At this rate, we'll get wiped out!

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.650
Yo, Levi.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.530
Not that I've got time 
to waste on you, but...

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.200
If you get past here, 
it'll all be for nothin'.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.410
So be it. Guess I'll have to play.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.080
Neener, neener, neener!

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.960
You're a spunky one, damn.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.590
Tsk!

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.610
Not sick of playing yet? Good grief.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.990
Didn't I teach you?!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.490
When chasing an enemy,
don't just stare straight ahead!

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.130
Over here, dimwit!

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.330
You... bastard.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.650
That really hurt!

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.690
If I can force one of them
to show a small opening...

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.670
Huh? Both of your shots were way off!

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.170
You like to live recklessly, too?!

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.850
Argh!

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.570
Hange!

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.230
Now! Fall back to the final defensive post!

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.220
Time to regroup!

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:05.710
Tsk!

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.930
Stay out of the way, you little runt.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.130
Ouch...

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.760
Drop it!

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.100
Guard the ritual, Captain!

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.190
Yeah, that's where I'll be!

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.950
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Syringe"
"A device Rod Reiss wants Historia Reiss to use and transform into a Titan. It is believed to use spinal fluid, and by injecting the transformation serum, one is granted the inherent abilities of a Titan."

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.750
It seems the enemy is nearby.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.290
Let's hurry, Historia.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.140
Right.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.460
What, Eren? Why are you glaring?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.970
It's because... he has perceived his fate.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.090
That the stolen power will
return to where it belongs.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.980
Historia...

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.870
That means inside you.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.000
Eh?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.950
This cavern... It was built around 100
years ago by the power of a certain Titan.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.640
Those three walls were 
built by the same power.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.500
By creating those enormous walls,
humanity was protected.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:35.010
The power of that Titan reached out to touch
people's hearts and alter their memories.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.220
However, several bloodlines
were excluded from that.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.510
But their descendants and
the rest of humanity...

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:47.230
...retain no history of the
world past a century ago.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.450
Except for one, Frieda Reiss.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.920
Frieda possessed more
than her power as a Titan.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.550
She knew how this world came about
and all the details behind it.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.500
She was 15 years old when
that knowledge became hers.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.130
Right here, 8 years ago in this very place...

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:20.440
...after she ate her uncle, 
my younger brother.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:43.120
Frieda inherited the Founding Titan
and the memories of this world.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.210
As had been done for 100 years,
repeated and passed through generations.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.670
Father...

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.260
Yes...

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:04.100
Basically, if Frieda had just used her power,
there wouldn't have been any problems.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.920
We might have eliminated Titans
from this world entirely.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.810
If only his father hadn't stolen
the power from her.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.800
Now, that power resides within Eren.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.860
However, that power...

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.300
It can't truly manifest unless the blood
of the Reiss family runs through them.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.870
As long as he remains a 
vessel for that power...

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.950
...this hell will forever continue.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.880
Eh?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.520
Then...

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.290
Kenny.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.140
So unless it's a Reiss who eats Eren,
they can't become a true king?

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.270
That is correct.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:56.690
Th-Then... even if I turn into a Titan
and eat Eren, it'll mean nothin'?

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.360
What are you--?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.900
Father!

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.950
Do you think I'm lying to you or something?

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.620
Nope.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:13.170
I waited long for this day 'cuz I knew you
weren't lying about the succession ritual.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.710
For crying out loud!

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:21.380
You used me this whole time knowing full well
what I was after, you sleazy playboy!

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.220
I'm grateful for you.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.100
You may have been a stray dog that my
whimsical younger brother took in, but--

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.020
Keep on insulting Uri, and you can
say goodbye to half of your head.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.560
Stop it!

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.440
Let my father go!

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.320
Huh? You're plain pitiful, Historia.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.280
Don't you get it?!

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:52.830
This father of yours wants to turn you
into a monster and make you eat Eren.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.210
Because that's my duty.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.090
Yes...

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:08.850
I'm going to eat Eren and 
bring my sister back.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:14.290
I'll inherit the world's history and
exterminate every last Titan!

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.110
That's my duty!

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.400
Hey, hey, Historia!

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.700
Have you forgotten everything
this guy has done to you?

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.200
The only thing he cares about
is the blood inside you.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.790
He doesn't wanna become a Titan himself!

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.310
He's just trash that forces
his brother and daughter to!

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.290
That's this father of yours!

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.300
He's wrong, Historia...

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:48.180
I must not become a Titan myself.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.430
Do not believe... what anyone else says...

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.400
Oh, is that right?

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.900
Father!

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.530
Kenny.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.700
You've served well up until now.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.950
You're free now.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.790
Go find another purpose in life...
and live out your years.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.840
That would bore me to death.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.010
Kenny! What are you doing?

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.600
Go ahead and turn into a Titan.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.640
I won't interfere anymore.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.110
However, no head starts.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.240
You both become Titans and have at it.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.410
If Historia wins, you'll have your peace.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.160
But if you lose to Eren,
the situation stays the same.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.670
Keep drawing breath till I run out and die?

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.420
Can you even call that livin'?!

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.510
Historia!

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.010
With this injection, you can
become a powerful Titan!

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.260
Then you can eat him,
but in fact, it's more than that!

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.380
You must bite his spine
and consume the spinal fluid!

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.440
Whoops, better step back.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.730
Hurry up, Historia!

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.450
Eren, why?!

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.790
Why aren't you transforming?!

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.620
If I become a Titan, you'll get eaten!

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.190
At this rate...

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.590
Do it, Historia!

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.420
It shouldn't have happened...

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.470
Eh?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.490
Me...

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.780
My dad, too...

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.770
If five years ago, he 
hadn't done that here...

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:12.390
Your sister... would have been
able to do something, right?

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:18.330
But my dad stole the Power of
the Titans from its rightful place.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.790
Just how many died for that?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.330
Armin's grandpa...

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.840
Thomas, Nack, Mina, Milieus...

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:32.900
Marco... Those guys on Squad Levi...
The people of Stohess...

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.680
Those soldiers who came to save me...

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:37.640
Mr. Hannes...

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.610
I can never atone for it all.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.730
It shouldn't have happened...

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.690
Those days of training...

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.570
That dream beyond the walls...

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.620
I... shouldn't have happened.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.910
So, at the least...

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.190
...let it end at your hand.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.810
Eat me.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.860
Save humanity.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.270
It's all... up to you.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.460
Eren...

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.370
That time...

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.730
...when you called me a normal
person, I was so happy.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.670
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.660
What's wrong, Historia? Are you scared?

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.940
All you have to do is inject
that liquid into your body.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.670
Father...

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.730
Why?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.780
Why didn't the Reiss family...
in that whole 100 years...

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.820
...eliminate the Titans 
and liberate humanity?

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:27.710
All while possessing the power
to control all the Titans...

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.530
Because, the first Reiss King who
built this world within the walls...

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.290
...wished for us to be 
controlled by the Titans.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:46.180
The first King believed that was
the only path to true peace.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.810
But I do not know why.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.610
It's only known by those who
see the world's memories.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.990
Long ago, I...

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.320
...along with my brother, pleaded with our
father to free humanity from the Titans...

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.530
...time and time again.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.830
However, he would not fulfill our wish.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.800
Eventually, it came time for
my father to pass on that role.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.800
When my brother inherited the Power of
the Titans and I looked into his eyes...

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.820
...I understood what that meant.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:26.350
To create this world...
To govern its very foundation...

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.980
To be an omnipotent being
is to be what my brother became.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.540
Do you know what we call that?

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.480
God.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.490
What we call that... is God.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.660
And my duty is to bring God back to
our world and offer them my prayers.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.940
I'm praying, Historia.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.460
For God to lead and guide humanity!

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.710
Christa.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.020
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.600
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.770
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.380
Historia!

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.510
God, my ass! You're just giving yourself
an out and manipulating other people!

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.680
I've had it! I won't let you kill me!

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.000
That's the spirit! This is gettin' good!

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.070
What are you doing, Historia?!

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.700
Eren, we're leaving.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.990
Hey, stop it!

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.740
If I go on living, everyone 
will keep suffering!

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
Hurry up and eat me!

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.450
I can't take living like this!

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.960
Shut up, idiot! Just shut up, crybaby!

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:22.460
Exterminate the Titans?!
Who the hell wants to do that bullshit?!

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:24.680
I'm starting to hate humanity!

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.590
Let 'em get wiped out by Titans!

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.230
I'm humanity's biggest enemy!

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.100
Got it?! I'm the worst girl who ever lived!

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:36.520
You escape from here.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.240
I'll destroy everything else!

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.610
Father...

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:45.960
Uri...

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.690
Frieda...

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.820
Wait for me...

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:51.460
I'll... now...

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.730
Rod Reiss becomes a Titan.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.150
To protect Mikasa and the 
others from a cave-in,

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.210
Eren is cornered by another decision.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.410
Next episode: "Outside the
Walls of Orvud District."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
