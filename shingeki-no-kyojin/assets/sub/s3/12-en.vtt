WEBVTT

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.390
In other words...

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.560
It's possible for us to plug
that hole in Wall Maria now.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.200
The Scout Regiment hurry their
preparations for retaking Wall Maria.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.710
Hell yeah! We did it, Eren!

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420
Eren?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.800
Let's hurry... make weapons, and get going...

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.090
...to Shiganshina.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.260
Seems if I inject this...
I'll turn into a Titan.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.890
There came another...

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.520
One more thing to shape
their fate had been found.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.530
Sorry I'm late.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.450
Well?

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.280
Have we discovered what's in the container?

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160
The thing is...

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.250
With our technology, I'm afraid
we can't dig much deeper.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.580
Like we've heard from Eren and Historia,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.840
it seems to originate from
some sort of human bodily fluid.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.760
However, it vaporizes when exposed
to air, making analysis difficult.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.850
Whoever made it must have had
technology far superior to ours.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.770
If it was the Reiss family,
I can't imagine how...

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.480
Hmm...

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280
In that case, instead of tampering with it,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.700
we should use it to achieve
our current objective.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.320
But who do we entrust it to?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.490
Erwin, to you?

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.330
No...

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.330
I'm no more than a wounded soldier.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.300
This box belongs with one of our elite
soldiers who has the best odds of survival.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.590
Levi, would you keep it?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.180
If it's an order, just say so.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.550
Why even ask the question?

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.480
We can't predict in what situation
we'll have to use this.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.560
We'll be relying on you
to make a decision on the fly.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.280
Judging when and who to use it on
will be for you to choose.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.160
Can we leave that to you?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.500
If this dream of yours comes true,
what will you do then?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.290
I... don't know.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.540
I won't until it happens.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.340
I see... All right.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.010
I'll do it.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.060
By the way, I'd like to unveil
that work of mine soon.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.560
Have you given it thought?

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.940
You still haven't given up on that?

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.690
If the public saw that repulsive display,
trust in the military would hit rock bottom.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.490
You don't know art when you see it.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.000
"Night of the Battle to Retake the Wall"

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.590
In other words, Eren's 
father, Grisha Jaeger...

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.850
...is likely a human who came
from outside the walls.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.310
Yes.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.730
Just like Annie, Reiner, and Bertholdt,
he possessed the Power of the Titans.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.030
But different from those three, he was
supportive of humanity within the walls.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.530
If he was so interested to know
about the Scouts and such,

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.950
we could've used more of that support of his.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.990
I wonder...

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.330
From the moment he entered the walls,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.250
he was searching for the royal
family all alone, I'm sure.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.840
And that...

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.130
That's not something you do
without incredible resolve.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.850
That same father wanted to show his
10-year-old son, eager to join the Scouts,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.810
the basement of their house.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.230
On death's door, he said the truth
of it all was... in the basement.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.820
What in the world do you think is down there?

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.320
Things which mustn't be said.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.240
No...

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.200
Things Grisha Jaeger couldn't say,
even if he wanted to.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.420
That which the First Reiss King
wiped from our memories...

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.830
...memories of our world...

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.630
...is what I hope, but...

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.760
Pondering about it here 
won't accomplish much.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.590
The preparations finished today.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.770
The operation to retake
Wall Maria starts in two days.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.350
Want to know what's in the basement?

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.940
Let's go see for ourselves.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.980
Isn't that what Scouts do?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.650
Let all your squads know.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.660
Right. Keeping it secret of course, yeah?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.660
On a day like this,
we deserve some meat, right?

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.120
Good idea. Gotta show those kids
us adults can be counted on.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.420
What about Commander Sadies
keeping secrets from us?

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.880
Forget about him.
We don't have time to deal with it.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.260
I'm shocked, Hange. You used to adore him!

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.760
Shut up!

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.640
What is it, Levi?

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.270
It's a bit hasty, but...

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.900
What will you do after retaking Wall Maria?

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.400
I'd guess a defense plan comes first, but...

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.190
After that?

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.490
Eliminating threats.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.750
Outside the walls, there seems to be
someone hoping Titans will eat us all.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.420
Of course, the answer to who
is in the basement, I imagine.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.920
It's as I said earlier.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.840
We'll plan that after the basement.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.050
I'm asking this because you
might not live that long.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.350
You can't exactly move like you used to.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.230
Let Hange call the shots.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.850
You'll just be dead weight.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.150
Let the good news come to you.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.570
We'll tell the others I 
argued till you gave in.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.900
No... That's actually what I intend.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.610
Fine with that?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.870
I'm not.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.670
I'm fine being food. Use me as bait.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.510
The chain of command still remains.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.470
If I'm gone, then Hange.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.390
If Hange's gone, the next.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.680
It's true, this operation
will be dangerous, but...

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.230
...to humanity, it's more
important than anything else.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.350
That's why I've gone to such lengths.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.860
This is all my plan.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.650
If I don't do it, the 
success rate will plummet.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.820
That's right. The operation 
might fail, but...

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.280
If you bite the dust in
the process, we're doomed.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.370
So just sit at your desk
and keep using your head.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.500
That's the last thing the Titans would want.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.920
And for humanity,
it's the best thing going for us.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.800
No, you're wrong.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.550
Our best option is for me to gamble it all--

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.510
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold up...

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:01.600
Keep using that bluff around me
and I'll break both of your damn legs.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.020
I'll make it nice and easy 
to attach them later.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:10.020
But the operation to retake Wall Maria
will proceed with you weeping here.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.320
It'll be a bitch to get to the toilet though.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.610
I'd like to avoid that.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.410
What you're saying is right.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.120
A wounded soldier should
stay off the battlefield.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.540
However...

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.000
There will come a moment when
we learn the truth of our world...

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.720
...and I must be there for it.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.510
Is it that important to you?

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.430
More than your legs?

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.060
Yes.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.020
More than humanity's victory?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.350
Yes.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.490
I see...

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.620
Erwin...

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.240
I'll trust your judgment.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.010
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Meat"
"After the fall of Wall Maria, there was a dramatic decrease in food production. Livestock in particular suffered due to requiring plentiful land. As a result, meat became expensive and occasions to eat it are scarce."

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:22.600
This may be a special night, but...
let's not let the public find out!

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.770
Behave like soldiers 
without causing a ruckus!

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.140
Eh? Meat?

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.360
What? Is this... meat?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.770
Am I dreaming?

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.490
Tonight's the night before
we retake Wall Maria!

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.110
Cheers!

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.610
Huh?! Wait!

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.950
Calm down! We'll split it evenly!

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.080
Hey! That big piece counts as two!

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.950
Hell no!

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.710
But you suck with the spear!
You're useless, so gimme yours!

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.790
Say what?!

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.210
Don't you start pulling 
that shit, potato girl!

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.920
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.380
Cut it out, Sasha!

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.090
I... I don't wanna have to kill you!

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.550
You can't eat the whole thing alone!

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.680
You're eating me! Eating me! Eating me!

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.520
Sasha! That meat is Jean!
Have you lost your mind?!

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.650
Do the Scouts never get fed any meat?

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.190
Pathetic...

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.200
Conny, would you knock Sasha out already?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.780
I'm trying!

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.830
She should be unconscious,
but she's still moving!

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.290
Hey, I think we've got casualties.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.210
Whose brilliant idea was it to serve meat?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:36.210
Sorry. But now we know blowing the food budget
for two months in one night results in this.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.380
That should do it.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.800
She finally ran out of energy.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.220
Can you believe this freak?

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.600
And to think she once offered
to share meat with everyone.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.560
Huh? When?

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.730
Four months ago, when we were
servicing the cannons.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.990
I brought some meat from
the officers' storehouse!

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:02.950
It'll be fine!

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:07.370
We can just raise more cattle and
sheep once we retake our land!

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.670
It's happening again!

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.040
The Titans are going to get in!

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.710
It disappeared!

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.340
I thought... I felt sorry for you.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.640
Hey.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.940
Only four months have passed since back then?

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.730
Only four months.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.440
But think, in just four months,
we're in Squad Levi.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.860
We climbed the ranks in a flash.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.240
It's 'cuz you're a genius.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.910
Damn straight I am.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.790
Let's eat before our food gets cold.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.750
Don't you see?

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.830
You're the rear guard 'cuz
you've got no experience.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.250
I understand that I may be weak, but...

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.260
Isn't the vanguard the best place
to learn how the enemy moves?

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.300
What's this? Trying to act all tough
talking about self-sacrifice?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.140
But if we're all not of that mentality,
how will we be effective as a unit?

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.730
Listen here... Everyone 
starts out as a recruit.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:20.940
If we throw recruits into battle like cannon
fodder, they'll all be too dead to learn.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.190
Which is why it's your job to
sit in the back and study,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.030
so you can come home in one piece.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:33.910
But the most useless of all is the suicidal
maniac who only knows how to charge in.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.120
Right?

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.500
Jean... Who do you mean by that?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.170
Who else but you?

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.840
You suicidal maniac.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.390
Actually, I found something out recently.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.800
I'm quite a normal person, you know?

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:56.190
So if you're saying that to me,
that just makes you a coward, Jean.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.610
You're so full of yourself, you pig shit!

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.190
You trying to grow out the hair
on your mane, horse face?!

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.320
Hey, what the--?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.900
Just don't hit the face.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.700
You jerk!

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.320
You're ripping it, ass!

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.490
What the hell are they doing?

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.670
You bastard!

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.710
Show 'em what you've got!

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.500
He's losing ground!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.300
Looks like something started.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.840
And here I told 'em to behave...

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.010
But seriously...

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.970
Ah?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.230
If you didn't have Titan powers,
you'd be dead ten times over.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.310
And every time, Mikasa would
swoop in to save your ass.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.110
If you insist on being suicidal...

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.700
...I'll just have to kill you!

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.950
That's something I'll have to take to heart!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.080
You should start showing
your mom some respect, Jean-boy!

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.370
Would you forget that?!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.000
Blargh!

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.330
Shouldn't we stop them?

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.630
No...

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.130
I think it's fine.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.140
Why isn't anybody stopping us?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.020
How long will this go on for?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.770
Shit... I think I'm gonna barf up that meat.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.900
Hey.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.230
You're all too damn rowdy.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.450
Go to sleep.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.780
And clean that up.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.410
Yes, sir!

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.540
Ouch...

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.960
It's weird when I say it, but...

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.790
Shouldn't you guys watch out for me more?

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.340
I knew if you got hurt it would
heal up quick, so I just watched.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.840
That's so cruel.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.470
You're the one who incited it.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.560
But... at least you're spunky again.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.270
I'm glad we met the commandant.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.190
I... It doesn't...

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:13.070
Whether I'm spunky or not,
I'll do what I have to do.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.200
But, yeah...

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.160
It's easier now.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.620
Kept thinking about stuff I can't change.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:27.420
And wondering why I can't be
strong like Mikasa and Levi...

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.250
I was jealous.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:36.390
But even you and the captain...
alone, you can't do much.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:41.100
Which is why we've all gotta
find the things we can do.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.850
And by joining together,
that's what makes us powerful.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.780
Every person is different.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.360
And it's all for times like this.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.330
Yeah...

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.380
I think you're right.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.360
Once we retake Wall Maria...

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.860
...and defeat all the 
enemies coming for us...

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.490
...will they come back?

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.110
Those days...

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.200
We'll bring it back.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.160
But some things are forever changed.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.870
We'll make them pay for that.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.340
Yeah.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:51.590
But there's more than that.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.050
The sea...

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:58.550
A salt lake so big that merchants
could spend their whole lives

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.220
and still not get all the salt.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.440
There's more than just 
Titans outside the walls.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.650
Fiery water, lands of 
ice, sandy snowfields...

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:16.280
I joined the Scouts so I could see all that.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.240
Y-Yeah. You sure did.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.670
Right?!

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.000
Let's start by seeing the sea!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.550
You still doubt that it's real, Eren!

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.800
You'll see! It does exist!

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.470
All right then.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.680
Guess we'll have to go see.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.310
It's a promise, then!

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.520
You have to!

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.560
--Yet another conversation only you two get.
--We can explore the outside world!

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.060
It's gotta be way bigger 
than inside the walls!

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.070
Okay, I get it.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.070
Just before sunset...

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.620
It's finally time.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.220
Hey!

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.510
Hange!

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.760
Good luck!

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.850
Flegel?

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.690
Take back Wall Maria for us!

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.480
The future of humanity is in your hands!

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.520
Captain Levi!

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.700
Thank you for saving our city!

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.660
You all come back in one piece, all right?!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.870
But go and reclaim our territory!

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.290
Someone's got a big mouth.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.750
Well, with the commotion we made,
of course they'd find out.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.050
The thing is, all that meat we ordered
was from the Reeves Company.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.720
Damn that Flegel.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.720
--Yeah! You can count on us!
--You know we will!

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.930
How long's it been since the Scouts
got a send-off like this?

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.350
Who knows? I don't think we've ever...

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.150
As far as I'm aware, this is a first.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.880
The final operation to retake Wall Maria...

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.670
...will now commence!

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:48.760
Advance!

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.510
You guys...

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.720
Do you have the faintest damn clue...

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.680
...what you're doing?!
