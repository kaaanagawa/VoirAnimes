WEBVTT

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.360
The true King within the walls...

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.170
...Rod Reiss and his devious
schemes were foiled.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.310
The Scouts succeeded in
rescuing Eren and Historia.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.950
However...

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.300
Appearing before them was...

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.510
...Rod Reiss, transformed into a Titan.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.460
Because I wanted to believe my father.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
I didn't want my father to hate me...

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.570
But now, it's time to say goodbye.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.930
When you're Queen, you can
punch that runt in the face.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.380
How do you intend to evacuate
the citizens in time?

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.890
We won't evacuate.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.500
We'll have the citizens remain
in Orvud District just as they are.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.910
"Ruler of the Walls"

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.920
What the hell are you thinking, Erwin?!

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.710
Keep the citizens in the
city without evacuating?!

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.840
By the time it's dawn,
that Titan will be all over us!

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.720
That Titan is an Abnormal.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.890
What the hell does that even mean?!

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.810
The target Titan is strangely attracted
to high concentrations of people.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.390
Hence, Abnormal.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.940
It means the fellow will turn
a blind eye to a small village,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.900
ignoring it in favor of
reaching this fortified city.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:50.660
"Capital Mitras"                           
"Orvud District"

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.370
If right now, you were to evacuate
the citizens within Wall Sina,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.910
it would be drawn towards them,
destroying the wall and all in its path.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.460
In the end, it would reach Mitras,
with the greatest density of people...

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.000
...and deliver a devastating 
blow to humanity.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.220
On our way back, we attempted to use
Eren Jaeger's power to control Titans, but...

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.790
...Rod Reiss' Titan showed no reaction.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.440
Stop, Titan!

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.670
Hey, stop! I'm talking to you!

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.410
Can't you hear me, idiot?!

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.660
Rod Reiss, that means you!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.280
You tiny old man!

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.920
If we are to stop that Titan, we must do so
outside the walls of Orvud District.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.300
For that to happen, we must
have the citizens act as bait.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.850
However, this does not change the fact

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.310
that our first duty as soldiers
is to protect the citizens.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.270
Supposing we're unable to halt the target,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.940
we'll take measures so that
not a single citizen is killed.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.320
We'll announce an emergency
evacuation drill for Orvud District,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.330
so that if needed, the citizens
will be ready to evacuate at once.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.300
It seems there's no other choice...

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.750
The body of our target
is the largest we've seen.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.830
As such, it presents an easy target.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.310
Wall-mounted cannons should
prove highly effective, but...

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.590
If that's not enough to bring it down...

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.630
The Scout Regiment will throw
everything we have at it.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.980
As part of this drill, dummy Titans
and cannons will be used!

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.200
It'll be a large-scale exercise
like nothing you've seen before!

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.690
However, we ask you not to panic!
Remain calm and follow our--

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.730
Ma'am.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.030
I gotta get my store ready for the day,
so can't you let us go home?

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.160
Customers won't be coming today.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.240
Take the day off.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.740
I don't think so, lady.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.000
What's with the drills 
when we're so far north?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.040
The military outs the 
government, and now this?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.670
What do you mean?

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.760
I'm saying this is all just a
demonstration of their power.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.720
To prove that now the fake King is gone,
they're the ones in control.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.760
So, we're being dragged through
this for no reason at all?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.810
Yeah.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.020
At this rate, I think I prefer the fake King,
even if he was incompetent.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.520
H-Hey! Look over there!

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.400
Smoke?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.120
Fire!

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.690
Well, how's that...?

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.210
Fire!

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.550
The ground cannons seem even less effective.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.860
Of course they are.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.390
The wall cannons barely hit the nape,
even with the better angle.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.280
What's the problem?

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.640
It's a mishmash of soldiers...

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.430
Cannons they scraped together...

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.940
Superficial leadership...

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.850
To top it off, this is a northern region.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.330
Unlike troops on the front lines,
they have no battle experience.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.870
However, this is the best we're
going to get, and that's a fact.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.400
Yeah, that much is painfully obvious.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.150
Yet again, your strategy for the Scouts
boils down to another gamble.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.170
Just like everything else you conjure up.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.590
Erwin! I brought the goodies!

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:53.090
All the gunpowder, ropes,
and netting I could find!

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.720
We'll have to assemble it ourselves though.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.720
Oh, and this! There's another
on the opposite side.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.020
The trigger's held in place,
so when it's fired,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.020
it'll wind itself back up,
just like ODM gear.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.740
So, is the artillery doing any damage?

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.110
Slightly more than a pissing insect.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.670
Then we're really planning on using this?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.240
Levi, Jean, Sasha, Conny...

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.830
Take care of that side.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.790
Roger!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.670
How should we do this? Let's see...

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.170
Try to imagine we're wrapping up
a nice gift for someone special...

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.840
I believe you've heard from Levi, Historia.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.250
Supposing we live through this,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.350
we'll have you become the Queen,
ruling our world in the walls.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.930
Naturally, having you on the
front lines poses a problem.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.600
I doubt it will work.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.540
You think the people so naïve that
they'd bow to a ruler in name only?

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.530
What is it that you're thinking?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.740
Fire!

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.610
Historia...

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.210
Just look how strong she's become...

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.200
For the longest time,
I thought she was the weak one.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.850
I had it wrong.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.570
The weak one was me.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.600
Somewhere along the line,
I thought myself special.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.270
Which is why, when other
soldiers died for my sake...

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.020
...I accepted it like it was natural.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.280
The same goes for my Titan powers.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.820
I hated Titans more than anything...

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.540
...but when I became one,
I thought nothing of it.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.190
I wanted to believe that 
strength was all mine.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.750
That's exactly how a weakling thinks.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.490
What's the next step?

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.510
So what if I'm able to plug up the wall?

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.470
Is that enough to save humanity?

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.960
I'm not special, I'm nobody.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.690
But... it's all of humanity that
got the short end of the stick...

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.720
...being stuck with me as their trump card.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.760
Hey.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.330
The kids in this city remind me...

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.420
...of us on that day.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.000
Yeah...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.030
Nobody thinks today is the day
a Titan bigger than the wall attacks.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.740
They might end up seeing the
same sight as we did that day.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.020
But there's one big difference.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.730
Atop the walls, soldiers 
stand to face the Titan.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.200
And that would be us.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.610
Yeah, stack it up on the edge.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.040
Eren.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.540
There's no time to stop. 
Keep your hands busy.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.500
Eren!

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.630
Wh-Whoa!

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.070
What are you doing?!

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.390
Making a wound? It's too early for that!

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.180
No...

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.390
Just beating the shit out of a useless brat.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:34.330
I hope he's dead and gone for good.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.980
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Rod Reiss' Titan"
"The transfigured form of Rod Reiss resulting from the transformation serum. Its size exceeds even the Colossal Titan and it possesses a similar ability to emit scalding steam. Due to its body and weight, it's unable to walk and must crawl across the ground."

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.900
Adjust your aim for a moving target!

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.130
Focus all cannons on its nape!

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.330
Fire!

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.040
Good! That ripped off its flesh!

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.710
Finish it off with a volley!

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.680
Argh, hot!

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.640
Shit, not good...

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.350
The wind changed direction!

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.930
Captain! I can't see a thing!

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.190
Doesn't matter! The target
is straight below! Fire away!

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.930
Are we too late?

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.520
It's a Titan...

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.970
Titan!

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.780
Wait! Don't go anywhere!

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.660
Shut up!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.090
Retreat! Everyone, retreat!

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.010
Shit... It's breaking through...

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.930
The city I grew up in...

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.120
...is done for.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.200
Stand back, Captain.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.100
We'll take over from here.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.480
Eren, we're up.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.650
Right.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.530
Armin, another thing's different from then.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.150
Eh?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.830
It might not be all they 
hoped for, but now...

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.030
...humanity has an ace up its sleeve.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.740
Is that... a Titan?!

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:06.760
We're good to go!

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:20.520
Let the attack...

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.400
...commence!

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.830
Take this!

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.090
Yes! It's losing balance!

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:58.720
Eren!

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.780
So you're saying...

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.570
In order to defeat that Titan...

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.740
...we'll stuff gunpowder into its throat...

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.370
...and hope it's enough to blow up its nape?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:20.580
Correct.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.350
With the heat that it's producing,
I imagine it'll ignite without a detonator.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.840
So as long as it hangs its mouth
wide open for us like an idiot...

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.390
An explosion against its nape
won't have the desired effect.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.330
Which is why the explosion
must go off from the inside.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:45.020
But the target may be protecting itself
by dragging its face along the ground.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.690
For all we know, it may not
even have a mouth to open.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.320
That's the gamble this time.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.850
Jackpot!

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.390
All troops! Finish it off with ODM gear!

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.850
It may be gigantic,

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.310
but its vitals are still one meter high
and ten centimeters across.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:32.440
Unless we destroy the main body, it will
regenerate and form another shield of heat.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.150
We've only got one shot.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.360
Hot!

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.170
Shit! Which is it?!

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.280
Historia?!

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:45.080
I understand your reasons, but...
I can't approve you entering combat.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.170
Commander, please!

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.290
I've finally grasped the duty
I was meant to fulfill!

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.420
That's why I'm here right now!

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.130
Well, in any case...

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.600
With my body as it is...
I can't exactly stop you, can I?

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.370
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.820
But this is the first time
I've gone against my parents...

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.540
This is my first fight... with my father.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.700
Father!

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.440
Listen to me, Father!

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.120
We can kill the Titans, once and for all!

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.170
Why?! Why don't you understand?!

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.280
You know I'll be fine, Brother.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.170
Pray for me...

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.380
Alma, you're the only one
who understands me...

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.430
Leave it to me, Father.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.220
I won't lose to the ghosts of our ancestors!

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.910
Oh, God...

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.160
Was our city just saved?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.500
Hey... You okay?

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.880
Are you injured?

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.320
Were you the one who
dealt the finishing blow?

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.000
Was that all... my imagination?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.680
Am I... really...

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.540
...acting on my own accord?

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.200
I... don't know.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.390
But...

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.490
The one always going with the flow is...

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.870
...without a doubt, me.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.090
I am...

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.510
I am Historia Reiss.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.700
The true ruler of the walls.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.820
I'm afraid... I cannot die right now.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.600
Please, forgive me.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.480
Gimme a damn break...

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.650
You hear me, don'tcha?

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.620
Gotta name?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.240
That's why I'm able to 
do any job asked of me.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.610
Are you any different?

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.240
Doesn't matter to me.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.580
It's all pointless anyways.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.290
Captain Ackermann!

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.190
Idiots! Get away!

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.660
Kenny.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.510
Oh, gee...

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.790
It's you?

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.410
Your comrades we fought...
They all ended up getting crushed.

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.340
Are you the only survivor?

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.600
Seems that way.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.810
Report back. I'm fine here alone.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:34.980
Understood.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.770
With those burns and that blood loss...

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.990
...there's no helping you now.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:54.700
Yeah?

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.640
I wonder...

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.680
Levi stumbles across Kenny
on the brink of death.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.860
In his hazy and fading mind...

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:51.200
...he remembers the man
he once called a friend.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.310
Next episode: "Friends."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Friends"
