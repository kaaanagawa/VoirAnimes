00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.480
There are names given
to each of the Nine Titans.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.530
That includes the Titan you will inherit.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.030
No matter which era this Titan
has found itself in,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.280
it has ever pushed forward,
seeking out freedom.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.910
For the sake of freedom, it fights.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.920
Its name...

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.710
...the Attack Titan.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.060
Eren was able to control
Pure Titans in the past...

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.060
...to escape a dire situation.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.100
If someone with royal blood
is made into a Titan that I touch,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.180
it might be possible for me to use
the Founding Titan's powers.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.320
But if they knew of that possibility,
what would the military do to Historia?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.630
Have a family.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.780
Huh?

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.580
Your wife, your child,
your neighbors if need be...

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.600
Love someone inside the walls.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.620
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.300
The same history... The same
mistakes... Over and over...

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.800
To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else,
you must see it through.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.560
Mikasa? Armin? Who is that?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.190
Who knows? I'm not sure...

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.550
Whose memories are those?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.960
"The Other Side of the Wall"

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.150
Our enemy is... the world.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.340
But if we announce this to the public,
the walls will crumble into chaos.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.890
That's right. We still haven't fully grasped
the magnitude of this situation.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.650
Then will we deceive the people again?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.150
You wish to follow the lead of King Reiss

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.970
and ensure the people of the walls
stay domesticated and ignorant?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.660
If so, then by what ideals did we rise
to take the crown from King Reiss?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.660
Let's announce it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.170
After all, we're just returning
the memories King Reiss stole

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.560
back to the people a century later.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.010
We all share the same fate
as people of the walls.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.610
We must unite as one and
bring our entire strength together.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.450
The true identity of the Titans
who've threatened us are humans.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.080
They have the same ancestry as us.
We are "Subjects of Ymir."

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.370
Our King erected these walls 100 years ago.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.080
He then altered our memories
using Titan powers

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.370
and made us believe humanity
outside the walls was wiped out.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.740
But in fact, humanity hasn't perished.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.010
When speaking of Subjects of Ymir,
they call us this: A race of devils.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.770
In the near future, the enemy will invade
our lands to obtain resources.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.840
Their plans began five years ago
with the attack of the Colossal Titan.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.110
I know the article's already published, but...
Is this as credible as you make it sound?

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.770
At the very least, it's consistent with
the doubts we've had this whole time.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.500
I don't want to believe it,
either, but it's true.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.600
Thanks.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.510
So? How are people reacting?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.510
It's a bit of everything.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.350
Some accept it. Some laugh it off.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.020
Some lash out at the military
and insist it's a conspiracy theory.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.980
As all of you feared, it's become chaotic.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.360
Yeah, but there's no helping that.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.820
The reports are what put food in our mouths.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.950
The taxpayers decide what to make of it.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.210
That's one thing we're doing
better than the old King.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.250
I couldn't be any prouder of all you.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.890
Eh?

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.970
Not only as a person of the walls,
but also as a fellow working man.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.720
Thank you.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.240
Right... Next time, whip up an article
that pats us on the back.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.480
What will happen to all of us?

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.900
Just as we've looked at Titans
with fear... with hate...

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.780
...and with the wish that they
would disappear from the world,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.290
the people of the world see us not as humans,
but as dangerous monsters.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.300
And as a result, what if this hell
only repeats itself?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.530
Until the last of us are 
wiped out, this hell...

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:55.750
won't end.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.440
Hey, you heroes of the walls.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.450
Hitch... You came?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.010
I just came to see you 
guys receive your medals.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.340
I see.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.170
Marlo was...

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.180
...brave all the way till the end.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.860
Yeah.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.530
Right, Floch? Tell her.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.260
Sure...

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.800
Marlo Freudenberg was an
urgent recruit, just like me.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.360
But he managed to bring us recruits together.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:52.290
The situation was hopeless and
the Scouts were on the verge of ruin.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.110
We thought all was lost
and were stricken with fear.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.050
But he... Only he inspired us.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.390
Yeah?

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.500
He was an amazing person.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.880
I know. That's why...

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.250
That's probably why he never listened to me.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.410
But in the end...

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.740
...I'm sure he regretted being there.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.410
Thanks.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.230
I'll laugh if you screw up the ceremony.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.610
Hey! Why did you do that?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.760
Because... Someone has to tell the truth.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:55.430
I know how desperate you were
to revive Commander Erwin.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.870
That's right.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.750
It should have been the commander, not you.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.680
I'm not the only one who thinks that.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.130
We all do.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.440
Everyone who read the report
thinks the same thing:

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.510
Why wasn't Erwin the one picked?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.720
What the hell do you know about Armin?

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.740
Tell me!

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.140
Nothing at all.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.860
I'm not his childhood friend,
and we're not chums, either.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.380
But I can still tell you 
why Armin was chosen.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.710
It's because you two and Captain Levi
brought your emotions into it.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.800
You thought the injection was all yours
and made a totally irrational decision!

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.350
Basically, it was too hard for you
to let go of someone important.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.020
Hey, you should shut your mouth.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:57.030
Eren. Deep down inside, I bet you think
you're always in the right.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.870
That's why you never gave up in the end.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.230
Just like a brat that won't listen.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.670
Eren, just leave him alone.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.880
Mikasa's the one who behaved like an adult.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.090
At least she gave up in the end.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.930
Hey! What the hell's wrong with you two?

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.980
Floch. Let's not do this during a funeral
for our fallen comrades, all right?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.440
What's done is done, so let's just drop it.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.440
And you guys... You didn't
stand up to your superiors.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.610
You didn't even stop Eren and Mikasa.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.100
All you could do was watch.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.260
Medals for what?

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.450
A funeral for who?

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.430
You guys better start telling the truth
when you go to enlist more recruits.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.440
That way, you won't get cowards
like me joining by accident.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.270
What the hell are we supposed
to do now without Erwin?!

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.110
Because... even fodder like me...

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.480
I get that I'm completely expendable, but...

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.030
Even fodder like me...

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.950
...has a right to decide
if it's worth dying for!

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.100
Floch is right.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.250
Commander Erwin is the 
one who should've lived.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.530
I'm not the one who can turn
this situation around.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.750
How can you be so sure of that?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.470
I really can't say if it was
the right decision or not.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.880
None of us know what the future holds.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:51.020
For starters, have you even 
seen beyond the walls?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.340
What is there beyond the walls?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.130
The sea.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.080
That's right. The sea.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.160
You haven't seen it, right?

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.990
None of us really know anything!

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.020
Fiery water, lands of ice, sandy snowfields!

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.110
The possibilities are endless out there!

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.420
On the other side of the wall, freedom is--

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.470
Hey, brats.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.950
It's time. Line up.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.980
What did we find in the basement?

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.920
Was it hope?

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.860
Or was it despair?

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.750
Our enemy was tremendously powerful.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.600
If nothing changes for the better,
that hideous scene will happen again.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:23.360
I'd easily give up my life if it actually
managed to change something.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:33.130
But I... am not about to sacrifice Historia.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.600
What should I do?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.030
I can't... tell anyone...

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.220
I'm an Eldian who came 
from outside the walls!

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.210
I'm a Subject of Ymir just like all you!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.890
King of the walls!

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.020
Please, you have to kill the
Titans attacking the walls!

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.070
Before my wife... and children...!

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.640
Before the people of the walls are eaten!

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:22.890
Eren?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.510
"Intent for the Future"
"It is evident that the world perceives us as a 'race of devils.'
The people of our world wish to eradicate us 'Subjects of Ymir.' However, we must not simply wait for our extermination to come about. As long as we live, we must strive to ensure our survival and our efforts to prevail must never cease. However, is a display of power enough to frighten the world our only method of doing so?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.980
Is there no other option than flaunting the very power
we possess, the Power of the Titans, that makes
the world believe we are devils? Is it delusional to think we could all sit around the same table and talk? I want to think it possible, even if it seems like an idealistic view. I believe coming up with a better way is my duty, and so I must never turn away from thinking about it."

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.270
The sound of Titans being crushed
by Trost's giant sledge went silent...

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.330
...as snow began to stick.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.350
When the piles of snow began to melt,

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:01.420
the military announced that Wall Maria
had been cleansed of Titans.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:07.340
The elevators of Trost were dismantled,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.520
and by the time work began
on paving the main road,

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.520
the flowers were budding
and the butterflies dancing.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.770
Refugees were finally permitted
to return to their hometowns

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.220
roughly one year following
the attack on Trost District.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:37.500
And so, six years after the
Colossal Titan's first attack...

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.790
...the Scouts once again resumed
expeditions past Wall Maria.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.970
It's just like you thought, Hange.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.970
The Titans inside Wall Maria
were pretty much all of them.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.730
We thinned out the majority
in just a single year.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.980
In that case, let's head straight
to our target as planned.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.300
A Titan!

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.180
One showed up, huh? Be careful!

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.510
Right there...

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.600
It's not able to move?

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:57.470
With a body like that... it tried to
crawl to the wall, little by little?

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.330
H-Hey!

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.660
It was shipped to paradise.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.300
It's a fellow patriot.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:23.900
Let's go.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.450
We're close.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.570
Hey!

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.990
Is it okay to leave it here?!
Shouldn't we kill it?!

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.160
Shit!

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.950
I'm sure of it.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.450
This is the place where Eldians
were made into Titans.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.050
And... beyond that...

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.740
Eyy!

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.570
--My eyes!

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.700
--Damn, it's salty!
--My eyes!

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.620
Woohoo! Is this thing 
seriously all salt water?!

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.500
Huh? What's that?

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.710
Hey, Hange! It might be poisonous,
so don't touch it.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.390
Eep!

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.110
Look!

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.590
I told you, Eren!

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.780
A salt lake so big that merchants
could spend their whole lives

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.240
and still not get all the salt.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.750
The stuff I talked about 
wasn't wrong after all!

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.450
Yeah...

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.890
It's so damn big...

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.860
Yeah.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.180
Look, Eren! On the other side of the wall--

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.450
There's a sea.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.540
On the other side of the sea... is freedom.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.630
That's what I always believed.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.350
But I was wrong.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.240
On the other side of the sea...

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.270
are enemies.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:15.470
Every part of this is exactly
how I saw in my dad's memories.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.040
Hey...

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.770
If we kill all our enemies... over there...

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.470
...will we finally... be free?
