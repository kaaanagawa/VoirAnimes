WEBVTT

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.280
Beyond the wall, there's 
a sea, or so Armin said...

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290
But past the sea...

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.500
I always wondered what's beyond that...

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.980
"Smoke Signal"

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.860
You just try to steal some food, Sasha.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.780
I'll get Captain Levi to chop you up
into nice bite-sized pieces.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.180
I won't! Probably...

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.780
Say what?

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.450
Hey! Did you guys wipe the dust and dirt
off your shoes before you came in?

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.200
Say what?

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.460
No, we didn't. Can't you see 
all the stuff we're carrying?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.590
Do you seriously think that attitude
will satisfy Captain Levi?

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.880
If I hadn't personally given your
sheets hospital corners this morning--

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.300
Quit nagging! Who are you, my mom?!

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.640
We're back.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.760
Wait, were you just chopping firewood?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.600
Gotta stay in shape.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
You got grabbed by a Titan! 
You should be in bed.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.440
I try to stop her, but she won't listen.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.980
I saw her doing sit-ups earlier!

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.900
How dare you, you peeping Tom!

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.440
--Huh?! How does that constitute “peeping”?!
--Mikasa, you <i>do</i> know you're not a wild animal, right?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.600
It's almost like we're 
back in the Cadet Corps.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.680
Yeah...

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.580
Why do you figure we were chosen
for the new Levi Squad, though?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.420
Protecting Eren and Historia
is such an important mission...

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.350
Because we're talented, I assume.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.590
Sasha... what did you just put in your bag?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.430
Nothing bread-related.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.340
Why, you!

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.470
Give it back.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.270
Hey, focus! We gotta finish cleaning
before the captain gets back!

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.850
Put back the bread.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.980
What's this commotion about?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.270
How many times have you done this now?

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.360
Our food reserves are precious!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.240
Cut the crap, Potato Girl!

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.030
I'm <i>quite</i> sure I gave you enough time.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.290
Anyways...

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.540
We'll discuss your lax 
cleaning job another time.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.580
Eren.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.220
Hange is itching to get 
the experiment started.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.490
R-Right.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.270
Eren!

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.440
What's wrong, Eren?! Get up!

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.650
The future of humanity is riding on you!

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.900
Get up, dammit!

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.740
Hey, four-eyes.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.360
He's not quite the same this time.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.070
He's not even 10 meters, and some
of his body doesn't have muscle.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.950
Plus, Eren's ass is hanging out.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.330
I can see that!

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.290
Eren! Can you still move?!

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.290
Give us a signal or something!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.640
Eren!

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.920
Mikasa!

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.410
Hey... That gloomy brat is 
acting on her own again.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.430
Time to think up a punishment?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.970
No, there's no signal... We're done here!

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.850
Eren!

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.520
Hot! Hot damn, you are hot!

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.190
Hange, wait! Eren is bleeding!

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.940
Whoa! Check it out, Moblit!

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.070
Eren's face! Hurry up and sketch it!

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.700
Section Commander!
Are you lacking in human compassion?!

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.040
Sorry, I got carried away...

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.740
Looks like we've got a long road ahead...

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.580
...before we can use the Titan
hardening ability to seal the wall.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.880
Yes... I knew we'd be grasping 
at straws from the start.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.300
Strategically, it's not a bad plan.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.220
Instead of lugging tons of supplies,
all we need is to get Eren there.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.350
Whether or not we're grasping at straws...
all depends on Eren.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.940
Experiment's over! All 
troops, disperse at once!

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.670
Roger!

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.860
Make sure there's no witnesses!

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.510
Yes, sir!

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.160
You ride in the same wagon as Eren.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.550
I'm headed for Trost District 
with Hange's group.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.670
Okay.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.750
You must find her at once.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.420
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.940
"Trost District"

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.940
I see... Another failure, then.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.660
If the plan would have worked out, we could have
plugged the hole in Shiganshina District in less than a day.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.370
It's because we lack information.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.750
Might be a different story if there was
a book about the hardening ability.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.670
But we have Christa. No, Historia Reiss...

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.630
Maybe we learn about the wall through her?

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.220
I read the entire report 
about her upbringing.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.190
She's the illegitimate daughter of Lord Reiss,
and it's by no means a happy story.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.490
But the real mystery here... is why a mere
regional lord would know the secrets of the wall.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.140
Eren!

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.700
You should still be in bed!

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.010
I'm fine. I already slept a whole day.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.590
Besides, it's my fault the strategy
for retaking Wall Maria got shelved.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.920
It's not your fault.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.690
So don't worry about it.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.930
All I care about... is getting
a chance to fight that Beast Titan.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.640
Whatever that damn ape is, 
I'll never forgive it.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.150
It's about time to switch lookouts.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:49.650
Mikasa?

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.110
Yeah.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.160
Must be nice.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.310
You and the others... You have goals in mind,
even though they won't be easy.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.880
But me, now that Ymir is gone...
I don't even know what I want.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.050
Don't you want to save Ymir, though?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.170
Yeah, but...

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.260
Back then, I couldn't believe what she did...
Though, it's true I wanted to save her.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.060
But now, I'm thinking differently.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.690
Ymir chose her own path in life.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.120
I have no right to change 
that... and no need to.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.110
Finally, you're talking again.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.030
Huh?

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.780
When we came here,
you told us all about yourself, but...

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.910
Since then, you haven't smiled once,
and you rarely talk either.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.670
Because it's a pain.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.570
Sorry.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.590
That good-girl Christa who was
nice to everyone is gone now.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.220
Nah, I think it's better this way.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.720
Huh?

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.730
Before, it felt like you 
always put on a facade.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.600
It was so forced and 
unnatural, it made me sick.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.600
I see...

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.860
But, the you right now is pretty normal.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.170
A stupidly honest, but normal girl.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.240
Anyways, you have plenty of 
time to think about Ymir.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.280
In a lot of ways, I...

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.580
Wait... Wasn't that...?

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.410
Hange and the others arrived!

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.290
Gather in the main room!

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.710
Huh? What was that?

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.930
He's dead... Pastor Nick.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.140
He was murdered.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.050
This morning, in the Trost District barracks.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.440
Hey!

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.520
You'll disrupt the crime 
scene, you damn Scout!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.740
Don't get any closer.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.780
This is our job, not yours.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.700
It's another robbery-murder.
They've been springing up a lot lately.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.950
Wha--?! I'm not buying that!

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.540
His nails were torn off!

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.500
Which unit are you in?

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.050
Fourth Squad Section Commander Hange Zoë
and Executive Officer Moblit Berner.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.840
Your ranks mean practically nothing
when your branch is the trash that it is.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.310
Listen here... It was no 
Titan that killed that man.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.430
A person killed another person.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.560
This work is out of your league.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.730
First Interior Squad?

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.380
Why? What's the capital's Military Police
doing down south in Trost?

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.910
What's so strange about it?

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.200
Unlike you useless goons, us valuable
soldiers are busy getting things done.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.960
Oh! So that's how it is!

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.090
You're right, I'm worthless, really.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.880
I'm so lucky to meet great soldiers like you.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.590
Let me shake your hand!

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.380
I see... So poor Nick was robbed...

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.210
Such a pity...

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.230
Did he ever have stuff worth 
stealing in the first place?

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.520
Of course.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.770
Everyone knows the Church's trinkets
are made from valuable iron.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.520
Huh?!

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.280
Nick was a pastor for 
the Order of the Walls?!

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.860
What are you talking about?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.810
He was a friend of mine on personal terms...

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.250
But, as far as I knew the man, 
he was just a chair-maker.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.080
I even wrote that on his application here...

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.960
Dammit, stop--

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.920
Though, I guess this only means I never
knew Nick as well as I thought I did...

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.840
Hey! Let go!

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.010
Oh, I'm sorry! Forgive me!

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.070
Well then, good luck with the investigation.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.430
When you capture the culprit, 
please tell them this...

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.440
The things you did to him,
perhaps you felt were righteous and just.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.900
But, personally, I couldn't 
care less about any of that.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.570
To you scoundrels, I will ensure
you're tortured alive like my friend,

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.990
and experience suffering above
and beyond what you did to him.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.910
Yes, you'll be sorry!

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.310
Pass along that message. Excuse us.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.720
Section Commander, do 
you think they really--?

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.050
Yeah... First Interior Squad, Djel Sannes.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.550
All the skin on his fist was split.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.520
Nick was tortured by the 
Interior Military Police...

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.760
And then murdered...

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:40.620
I figured the Church would want to deal with Nick
since he was cooperating with the Scouts.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.950
That's why I hid his identity and
had him stay in the barracks, but...

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.370
To think they would use 
soldiers to kill him...

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.120
I was too careless.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.960
It's entirely my fault.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:05.220
The Military Police... Did they torture Pastor Nick
just to find out what information he spilled to us?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.260
Most likely.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:12.280
But it was the Interior Military Police,
which means there's something more behind it.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.640
So, how many nails did Nick have ripped off?

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:16.600
Huh?

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.770
You saw, right? How many?

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:23.490
I only caught a glimpse of him,
but all the nails that I could see.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.980
People that talk, talk after one. If they don't,
peeling more won't make a difference.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.500
Pastor Nick... I thought 
he was an idiot, but...

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.340
He didn't turn away from what
he believed, all the way till the end.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.950
In other words, they have no idea
we've caught wind of the Reiss family.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:53.090
Though, someone in the government is up
to no good, and their eyes are fixed on us.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.520
Captain Levi.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.020
A message from Commander Erwin.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.160
I went to tell him about Pastor Nick,
but he sent me off with this.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.490
Everyone, out. We leave now.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.660
Leave no trace we were here.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.960
That was close...

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.960
If we hadn't left right then,
what would've happened to us?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.460
But why? What would make Commander Erwin...?

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.260
New orders came from the government.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.140
There's been a freeze on all Scout
Regiment activity outside the wall.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.340
They're telling us to hand 
over Eren and Historia.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.730
By the way, right after 
he gave me the message...

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.430
...the Military Police came for him...

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.680
That's treating him like 
some sort of criminal!

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.470
Someone's not working 
from the shadows anymore.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.950
They're moving for all eyes to see.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.970
To go that far to protect 
the wall's secrets...

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.470
What's more, why do they want us
to hand over Eren and Historia?

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.090
Not to kill, but for them to obtain?

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.350
Who knows?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.150
Anyways, it's clear the 
enemy is after these two.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.220
Loitering around here is dangerous.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.900
We're moving her and Eren to Trost District.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.400
Why? That's the same place 
Pastor Nick was killed.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.030
It's worse to head towards the interior.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.520
With Trost in a panic, it 
should be easy to slip in.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.570
And if somehow it comes down to it,
we can use these in the city.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.930
True...

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.360
Plus, not knowing the enemy 
puts us in a tough spot.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.410
We need to find out who's behind this.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.500
Hange, lend me some of your squad.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.540
Of course.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.380
All right, I'm going after Erwin.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.430
Moblit's with me. The rest 
of you will follow Levi.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.970
Roger!

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:54.910
Hange!

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.790
Here...

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.390
I remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.310
Didn't get time to tell you, but it's here.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.650
All right.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.360
I'll take a look at it later.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.530
Hiyaah!

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.540
They're rather quick on the move.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.960
Hmph... It's because that
little runt is actually disciplined.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.180
An acquaintance of yours?

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.340
An old one.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Titan Bodies"
"The body of every Titan varies significantly,
 but each has a weak point
 of height 1 meter and width 10 cm at their nape,
 corresponding to the size of a human's
 spinal cord through to their brain.
 When severed, this area ruins a Titan's
 regenerative ability and results in their destruction.
 It is thought that this vital organ, the source of their being, is none other than a human inside."

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.460
Try not to walk in a 
cluster. We'll stand out.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.690
Eren and Historia, just walk normal.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.110
Why is the royal family's 
flag hanging everywhere?

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.410
Oh! Today must be the anniversary
of the King's coronation.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.450
Once a year, they hand out a haul of rations.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.120
Oh...

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.200
We'll begin handing out rations!

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:09.190
King Fritz has heard of Trost District's hardship
and will donate the royal family's reserves!

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.380
There's enough for everyone! Line up orderly!

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:13.970
--Thank goodness!

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.680
--Long live King Fritz!
--Thank goodness!

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.970
What a King! He sure is generous!

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.920
He's got more than he knows what to do with.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.180
People are weak, especially 
when baited with food.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.240
By handing out those rations,
over 60% of the reserves are gone.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.950
Don't you think it's a bit too much for
raising the people's morale, Lord Reiss?

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:45.460
It's necessary. There was a need to raise
the public's approval of the royal family.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.420
More importantly, we need 
that power and the vessel.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.210
And we must hurry.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.210
The Military Police failed again?

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.590
I'll return and continue the hunt at once.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.710
No, we'll soon have what we need.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.070
"That" is set in motion.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.360
Watch out! Behind us!

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:24.950
Armi--

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.370
I mean, Christa and Eren!

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.980
They got snatched away again!

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.130
Will it really work?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.180
He looks absolutely nothing like me...

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.470
That horse face? Yeah right...

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.730
Yeah? You like that? Let me hear you moan.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.070
Well? How's that? Doesn't it feel good?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.700
I'm just dying to hear 
your cute little voice.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.540
This is why I didn't wanna go
through this shit a second time!

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.920
Screw being his body double!

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.710
She’s more muscular than I expected…

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.110
How's it going inside?

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.020
If we don't hurry, they'll 
see through Armin's disguise.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.790
And I feel bad for him...

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.250
I see.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.610
How is your leg? Any better?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.620
I can move well enough. It's not bad.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.190
More importantly, these kidnappers...
They're nothing but amateurs.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.280
Why would they be using guys like this?

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.920
You can handle the rest on your own.
I'm heading for Eren.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.340
Once you've dealt with the trash,
come and meet up with me.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.130
Roger.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.620
One more thing... I'll 
tell you, just in case.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.450
Tell Armin and the others, too.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.740
You're sure, without a doubt, 
it's Christa and Eren?

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.240
Yes, they match the description.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.940
Huh? Where's the guard?

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.710
What the--?!

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.800
Don't you dare move.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.850
Conny! Is it really just the four of them?!

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.600
Yeah, that's it!

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.460
Nobody else in the area!

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.400
If you move again, who knows where I'll hit?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.870
All right! First, we tie these guys up,
then we meet up with the captain.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.160
What do you mean?

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.960
Captain's orders, and 
he sends a message, too.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.600
Hey! Get outta the way!

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:22.130
Captain?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.300
Well?

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.390
The road is crowded, but nothing unusual.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.580
It's not much farther to Commander Pyxis'.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.520
How's the body double mission?

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:32.950
A success.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.810
And yet, you don't look that happy...

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.140
No...

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.920
Something is wrong...

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.650
The Military Police can't be behind this.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.850
They're far too arrogant. 
They wouldn't use amateurs.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.220
This is more like...

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.740
Assuming the wagon was being followed...

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.290
And the group was trailing their target...

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.160
Captain.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.010
The wagon's almost moving again.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.580
Nifa, have you heard about Kenny the Ripper?

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.130
The mass-murderer in the capital?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.680
The one that slit the throats 
of over 100 Military Police?

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.560
That's just an urban legend 
from years ago, right?

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.480
He is real, and the stories are true.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.110
Huh?

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.480
I lived with him for a 
while when I was a kid.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.080
What? Why would you even say that?

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.150
This isn't the time to be making jokes.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:31.160
That's right... He wouldn't 
care about using amateurs.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:36.410
If a group was trailing their target,
it would be from both rear angles, and...

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.020
...a place high up, with a view...

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:42.630
Nifa!

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.510
Yo, Levi.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.960
You grown any yet?

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.470
Oh? It don't look like you changed at all!

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.970
Kenny!

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.090
Kenny and Levi meet again.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.650
The enemy's target was Eren and Historia.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:52.430
In order to get them back, Levi and
the others must take aim and shoot.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "Pain."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Pain"
