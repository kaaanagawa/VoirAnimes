WEBVTT

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.240
We're good to go.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.440
All right! Drop it!

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.470
Captain Levi!

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.500
What? Your face looks like it's leaking shit.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.020
We've found Kenny Ackermann!

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.990
"Friends"

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.630
Never imagined there was someone
stronger than me in the world...

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.240
So this is a Titan...

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.260
To think they really existed...

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.640
What's more, within the walls...

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.190
Uri! Hold him right there!

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.820
Rod, wait. Don't shoot.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.220
Whoever it was who told him about us
is likely part of the council.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.820
We must discover who's responsible.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
In that case, use your power
and make the assassin talk!

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.970
That's something I cannot do.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.760
If I had to guess, this man is a
descendant of the Ackermann family.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.590
In which case...

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.770
...his reasons for raising a blade
are within the man himself.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.680
Uri!

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.190
If you won't do it, I'll kill him!

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.230
Argh, shit! Forgive me, will ya?!

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.650
You're the true King, ain'tcha?!

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.910
Get yer hands off me! I gotta escape!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.160
Lemme go and gimme another chance!

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.770
--Up against such overwhelming
might, I was powerless.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.770
--I'll do it right next time
and attack while you sleep!

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.060
--You gotta admit stuffing your skull
with shit is such a nice idea!

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.830
--After all, he literally 
could've crushed me to death.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.710
--Violence was all that I had, 
but even that had failed me.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.340
--Violence was all that I had, 
but even that had failed me.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
--I was gonna pack you so full of shit,
it'd blow a new hole in your ass!


00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.490
--It's not my fault!
I can't control my creativity!


00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.600
--Now that I think about it, my family's 
grudge never even meant much to me.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.120
Y-You're crazy!

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.650
M-My legs!

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.660
Hey! Uri!

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.040
What was that for?! He's an Ackermann!

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.870
You can't erase his memory!

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.280
We've gotta kill him!

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.120
Considering how the Ackermanns
have been persecuted in our name,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.400
your hatred is justified.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.230
However... I'm afraid I cannot die right now.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.860
Please, forgive me.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.550
Even within such tiny walls,
to be unable to build paradise...

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.860
...I'm a fool.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.660
For a King that held so much power
to bow down to trash like me...

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.300
His Titan alone shocked me plenty,

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.420
but him doing that rattled something
inside me like nothing ever before.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.190
I said right there I wanted to
help him... and Uri nodded.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.360
At the very next council, missing was
the one who tipped me off to the Reiss,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.270
and in his place was the Reiss' new dog,
legs stretched up on the table.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.510
That was my new line of work.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.140
It was a bit pathetic for me, but it
ended the Ackermanns' persecution.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.630
Though walking around in broad daylight
was... something I wouldn't risk.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.310
But I had fewer enemies.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.930
Kuchel... Ah, if you mean Olympia...

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.420
She's been sick for so long now,
she hasn't sold in ages.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.530
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.720
Damn, you've lost a ton of
weight since last time, Kuchel.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.360
She's dead.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.250
Huh?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.950
And you?

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.540
Are you alive?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.470
Hey, hey, gimme a damn break...

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.680
You hear me, don'tcha?

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.310
Gotta name?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.860
Levi.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.710
Just Levi.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.670
I get it, Kuchel...

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.120
That's true...

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.220
Not worth using your name...

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.790
I'm Kenny.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.020
Just Kenny.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.220
I used to know Kuchel.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.980
Nice to meetcha.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.110
An unfriendly brat on the brink of death...

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.070
...is all Kuchel left behind.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.450
I wasn't so heartless that
I'd let the runt die, but...

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.590
...I wasn't steppin' in as a parent, either.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.330
There wasn't much I could teach 'em, but...

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.370
First up was how to grip a knife.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.440
How to get along with people...

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.880
...and how to say hello.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.420
How to swing a deal...

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.280
...and how to swing a knife.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.180
Basically, all one needs to know
to survive in the underground.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.060
If he wanted to go above ground,
it was up to him.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.370
But, when that time came,
he had to do it himself.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.190
Let us pray...

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.900
For true world peace...

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.990
Interior Police?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.700
Ah, so that's who you're with?

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.250
Sorry about killing so many of your pals.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.010
But look at you now.
The King has made you obedient.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.450
His glory is boundless.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.550
Say, Sannes... Sounds like you
revere the King like crazy.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.020
That's why I'm able to 
do any job asked of me.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.550
Are you any different?

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.270
Why do you abide by the King?

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:11.900
I...

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.970
Who knows?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.330
Probably 'cuz he's the strongest around.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.080
Yeah...

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.100
In our world, the one on top is the one
who can show they're the strongest.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.010
Power is all you need.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:37.630
--At the least, it'll mean you don't
go out like my sister did.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.880
--Do you understand, idiot?!

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.320
I don't have long left...

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.440
Anyone could tell that at a glance.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.530
Funny how you're a monster,
yet age and disease do you in.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.560
You disappoint me.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.560
It's not that.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.910
Eh?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.310
This power will be passed
down to Rod's children.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.820
But I should live on 
inside of their memories.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.090
What's that mean?

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:17.570
You can pass down that power?

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.570
Kenny... In the not too distant future,
this world will crumble.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:35.370
And in humanity's fading twilight...
I wish to build paradise.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.130
You believe in violence, do you not?

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.860
It's the unavoidable truth of our world.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.370
Though...

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.370
When we were at each other's throats,
what was it that made us friends?

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.420
Was it violence?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.220
No idea.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:03.130
But if you hadn't squeezed me
in that stupidly big hand of yours...

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.400
...I'd have stuffed your
skull full of shit for sure.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.300
Before we became "friends," you know?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.410
Yeah... It's the unavoidable truth...

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.290
Even so, I...

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.510
...I believe in the miracle
that happened back then.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:32.810
In the end, I never saw
eye to eye with him on that.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.310
Just like he said, the monster was passed on.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:50.210
One look in her eyes,
and I knew he was in there.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.900
Rod's daughter preached
to anyone who would listen

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.770
about love, peace, and all that,
just like he used to.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.590
How'd you find the time to talk
about such useless shit?

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.750
Is it because you're so powerful,
you have that luxury?

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.950
If somebody obtains that power,
would they be the same way, too?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.330
For example...

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:17.710
...even me?

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.310
I'm Kenny Ackermann.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.970
If you like dumb names,
I'm known as Kenny the Ripper, too.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.060
I've slit so many military police throats
like yours that I'm bored of it, but...

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.230
Well, a lot happened and...

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.980
...it seems I'll be captain of this new
Anti-Personnel Control Squad.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.240
Nice to meetcha.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.240
Hmm?

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.490
Yeah, it don't make much sense.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:56.080
I'm sure you're all pissed off that a crazed
killer not from the military is your boss.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.290
Doesn't matter to me.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.000
Hmm?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.800
Two years since the wall fell, and
people have given up fighting Titans,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.010
squabbling over the land 
we have left instead.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.670
That's what we're here for, right?

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:15.300
We followed the rules, climbed the ranks
of the military, and here we are.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.270
Doesn't matter to me.
It's all pointless anyways.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.450
Don't you worry!

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.830
This squad to counter the
Scouts ain't even legit!

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.290
It's nothin' more than a guise I thought up.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.460
Just to make those shits on
the council nod their heads.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.790
Then why are we here?!

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.630
Well, I'll tell you why! 
It's all for a grand dream!

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.010
Power rivaling a god...

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:55.060
All who get their hands on that power
somehow become compassionate.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.150
Would it be the same for a shit like me?

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.860
I gotta know.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.320
What does it feel like?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.200
From their point of view,
what do they actually see?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.770
Could trash like me...

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.840
...see the world the same way you saw it?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.010
Well, Uri?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.110
Kenny...

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.990
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Ackermann Family"
"A family of warriors who once served the royal government. They began to be persecuted after distancing themselves from the royal family. The details are unknown, but some experience a mysterious 'awakening' and gain abilities exceeding a typical human's."

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.010
With those burns and that blood loss...

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.180
...there's no helping you now.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.450
Yeah?

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.500
I wonder...

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.480
I swiped this little one 
right out of Rod's bag.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.360
Seems if I inject this... 
I'll turn into a Titan.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.740
One of those dumb Titans... unfortunately.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.740
For a while... it should extend my...

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.210
...life.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.210
You've had the time and
strength to inject yourself.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.280
Why haven't you?

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.640
Yeah...

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.080
I wonder...

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.200
If I don't inject it right...

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.590
...I might end up like he did...

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.780
...all messed up.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:11.460
I know you're not sitting 
here waiting to die.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.910
Don't you have a better excuse?

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.000
I... don't wanna die...

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.850
...and wanted power.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.040
But... I see...

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.730
I think I understand why
he did it, after all this time...

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:35.740
Huh?

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.080
Everybody I've met... was all the same.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.620
Drinking...

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.780
Women...

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.320
Worshiping God, even...

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.370
Family...

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.500
The King...

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:05.130
Dreams...

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.420
Children...

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.540
Power...

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.260
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.250
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.000
Even him...

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.410
A-And what are you?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.070
A hero?!

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.780
Kenny. Tell me everything you know!

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.750
Why doesn't the First King
want humanity to survive?!

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.980
Beats me...

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.090
But... we Ackermanns...

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.510
...opposed him... for that reason.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.380
My last name seems to be Ackermann, too.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.270
You... What were you to my mother?

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.500
Heh, you idiot...

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.780
Just her brother.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.330
That day... why?

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:27.860
Why did you leave me?

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.310
Because...

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.060
...I'm not meant to be...

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.810
...someone's father...

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:57.490
Kenny...

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.060
That girl toppled the Titan
bigger than the wall?!

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.690
Yeah! All the people of
Orvud District witnessed it!

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.650
She saved us from that Titan
with such a tiny body?!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:41.570
Her father ruled as King from the
shadows, but she ended his tyranny!

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.950
She's our true ruler of the walls!

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.700
Queen Historia!

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.460
Let me deal the killing blow to the Titan.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:57.000
That way, we can unite the walls
as one and stabilize the situation!

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.220
To think she actually 
dealt the killing blow...

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.780
Hold on... You're seriously 
doing it, Historia?

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.570
Yeah, I am.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.310
Mikasa was just joking 
about it! Right, Mikasa?

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.790
After you smack him, tell him this...
"I dare you to hit me back."

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.950
Damn you...!

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.080
If it's not a real grudge, just forget it.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.000
If I can't do this,
how can I call myself Queen?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.590
Hell yeah, Historia. That's the spirit!

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.410
Whoa!

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.320
How'd you like that?! I'm the Queen!

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.780
If you got a problem--

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.660
Thank you... all of you.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.640
Reiner!

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.360
I won.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.480
Saving Annie can come later.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.800
Retrieving the Coordinate is
our priority, as it should be.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.410
If we just wait here, it'll come to us.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.520
They thought themselves special...

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.030
When a certain man imparts old tales,
Eren learns the past of his father, Grisha.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.590
Next episode: "Bystander."

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.640
"Bystander"
