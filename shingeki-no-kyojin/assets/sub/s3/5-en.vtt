WEBVTT

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.100
You had your time, but it's over!

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.350
Look above you, morons!

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.650
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.620
It's no use!

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.410
If you don't turn yourselves in, every last
Scout we captured will get the noose!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.960
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.750
When it comes, I will only watch.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.480
It's up to you to decide.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.960
You... and them.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.980
"Reply"

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.910
That sure is a lot of wagons.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.570
What's going on?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.200
You don't know?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.710
Right now, all the heads of the
military are meeting inside the castle

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.620
to finally dismantle the Scout Regiment.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.710
See?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.750
There's the gallows for
hanging their commander.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.510
I bet it's ongoing as we speak...
his final judgment.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.190
If humanity loses the Scout Regiment,
that means humanity loses their spear.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.440
When enemies close in, you guard not with a
shield, but a spear that eliminates the threat.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.150
Suppose now, if this instant,
Wall Rose were to be breached...

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.990
The residents of Wall Rose would again
flee and take refuge in Wall Sina.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.830
But the earlier evacuation left stockpiles
with no more than a few days at best.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.370
In the blink of an eye, most of the residents
would be forced to fight for survival.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.590
Wall Rose and Sina... Humanity would be split
in two factions and civil war would erupt.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.330
Even if the wall was not breached, Wall Rose
is continually suffering a food shortage.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.890
It may not be Titans that breach Wall Sina...

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.940
There's a chance the residents
of Wall Rose do it first.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.690
Reclaim Wall Maria.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.430
If humanity is to ever hope for
a future, that is the only way.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.020
Are you implying that the Scouts
are needed for such a cause?

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.610
Our duty as Scouts has always been
to charge forth at the enemy.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.960
Cowering away will not solve anything.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.470
Or could it be... you have some sort
of secret plan to overcome this ordeal?

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.520
Erwin, I don't think you understand.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840
The reason you're here today is not
to discuss our future within the walls,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.480
nor is it because of something
as simple as murder.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.280
Clause Six, Charter of Humanity.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.830
"Thou shall not prioritize one's own
gain over the longevity of humanity."

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.960
You're here for this grave offense.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.630
Indeed. You've refused to hand
over Eren Jaeger multiple times.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.550
In doing so, you've violated the Charter.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.930
But Eren is vital for reclaiming Wall Maria!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.470
That is not for the Scouts to decide!

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.970
Eren Jaeger is a Titan whose
powers are not understood!

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.480
Sheltering him within the walls
is a risk to humanity!

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.620
It's absurd for a single commander
to have control of him alone.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.480
And yet, you stubbornly persisted
in some plan of yours.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.010
Not only did you feign his abduction
and conceal Eren Jaeger...

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.330
...but you silenced Dimo Reeves
since he knew of your plans.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.200
This is clearly treason.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.120
It is not a stretch to say that
you're the threat to humanity.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.540
Commander Pyxis.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.040
Hmm?

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.090
The Garrison and Scout Regiments
both risk their lives on the front lines.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.300
How are we to know that
you're not his comrade?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.560
I'm quite disturbed that you believe
we would align ourselves with the Scouts.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.600
Nothing is more senseless
than humans killing humans.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.850
In this cramped world that we humans have,
one spark will engulf all in no time.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.610
When it came time to defend Trost District,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.730
that's what I told my soldiers
before sending many to their deaths.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.870
If the Scout Regiment is that one spark,
it should be smothered at once.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.460
After all, if the Titans do manage to break

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.410
the wall and find hardly anyone left inside...

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.760
...those poor Titans might go hungry.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.230
Very well.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.250
Allow us to discuss.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.240
Your Majesty... May we?

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.520
Erwin... Is this how you want it to end?!

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.550
In the name of the King,
I will announce your judgment.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.460
Erwin Smith.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.880
For violating Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.630
you are sentenced to death.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.770
Your execution will be carried out immediately.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.270
Take him.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.100
Is this what you wanted, Erwin?!

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.610
With this, you're...

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.710
Wall Rose...

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.840
...has been breached!

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.760
The Colossal Titan appeared out of nowhere!

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.390
Along with the Armored Titan, they broke
through both gates of Calaneth District!

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.450
Currently, refugees from the East
are flocking here for safety!

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.760
Establish a route for the evacuees!

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.860
Have all Garrison troops
converge and defend the East!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.160
Get the evacuees safely to Wall Sina!

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.910
Everyone, hurry! Saving the
evacuees is our top priority!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.990
--Sir!

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.620
--No!
--Sir!

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.000
Hmm?

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.960
Close up all of the gates to Wall Sina!

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.500
Don't let a single refugee inside!

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.610
Huh?!

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.300
B-But that's... all the Wall Rose residents?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.810
Your command is to sit back and
watch as half of humanity dies?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.730
It's just like he said earlier!
That's asking for civil war!

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.690
We can't let the government lose control!
If that happens, it's over!

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.940
B-But... That's only a mere possibility!

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.700
It's enough for that possibility to exist!

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.500
Our authority is and always will be absolute!

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.320
Now, get moving!

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:45.970
Shit...

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.550
To think the wall would be
breached at a time like this...

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.300
Though, there is a silver lining.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.050
We've already found the power.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.260
All that's left is to bide our time
until the vessel takes it.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.640
That's right. There's no need to be
flustered by this little disaster.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.600
As long as Wall Sina holds up, we'll be fine.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.140
Yes, once Lord Reiss comes back...

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.940
Let's do it! Close the gates!

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.860
Wait!

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.510
It'll be too late if we wait!

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.970
Who gets to choose?

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.500
Who decides?

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.540
What are you doing?! Hurry it up!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.540
It'll be treason if you don't!

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.460
I will not!

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:32.210
What?!

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.480
Hey...

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.590
I... am a human of Wall Rose!

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.100
I will not allow the gates to be closed!

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.010
You fool!

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.720
I will stand behind him.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.400
Dhalis Zachary...

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.650
Are you surprised at all by
their reaction, Premier Zachary?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.030
No... Not a bit.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.660
Zachary, what's the meaning of this?!

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.010
That report just now was a false alarm.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:07.770
Rest assured.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.040
At the moment, there has been
no report of a Titan attack.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.880
You bastards! What is this farce?!

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.900
If you want the mastermind, it's me.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.230
Pyxis?!

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.310
It seems most of the Interior Police
are off somewhere or other.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.600
I suppose that's quite fortunate.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.560
What do you mean?!

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:33.730
Earlier, I declared to you that the Garrison
Regiment isn't aligned with the Scout Regiment.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.360
But I did forget to mention one thing...

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.570
I'm not aligned with any of you either.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.470
While I do possess some of the
same feelings as Erwin here...

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.020
...I considered leaving things
up to your government

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.170
if that were the better choice
for the sake of humanity.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.570
You are, after all, much wiser than us
when it comes to Titans and the walls.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.410
Supposing you actually cared about
saving as many people as possible,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.360
I would have been fine
sending Erwin to the gallows.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:13.760
Of course, depending on your decision,
all of us were prepared to forfeit our heads.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.690
However, the answer you've
given us is very clear!

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.400
We may be ignorant about the Titans
and their powers, but...

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.540
I daresay, we in our ignorance can save
far more people than you ever could!

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.040
Y-You're a fool! What do you think
undermining us will accomplish?!

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.460
The citizens will never listen to you!

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.800
They'll obey whatever the crown says!

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.970
The regional lords will have none of this!

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.810
It seems you don't quite understand.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.590
This is no mere threat.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.330
It's a coup d'état.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.750
We've successfully restrained
the Interior Police!

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.600
Mmm.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.320
The thing with soldiers, they'll obey
their superior officer over the king.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.450
Especially when the king in question is a fraud.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.700
We will put in place a new ruler of our own.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.200
It can't be... They're actually...

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.340
Don't even think you can
get away with this hoax!

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.750
If that disaster had in fact happened...

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.430
The decision that all of you made violates
Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.050
Furthermore, is installing a fake king

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.980
to personally control and run the
government not punishable by death?

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.820
Shit! Wake up, dotard!

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.070
What? Time to eat?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.270
Shut up, you useless oaf!

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:52.490
Erwin...

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.500
This is your victory.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.200
Aren't you happy?

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.660
Nile.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.110
Humanity has just begun down a new path...

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.550
One far more dangerous than before.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.780
And there you have it.
The coup d'état was successful.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.160
Premier Zachary has control of
the capital and administrative district.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.120
For the time being, the nobility hasn't rebelled.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.630
What about the Boss Reeves incident?

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.840
We got a confession that proved
the charges unfounded.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.630
His son Flegel really pulled through big time.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.800
Don't you get it?!

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.140
The government doesn't give
a shit about saving any of us!

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.220
Face the truth now, because it'll be
too late when you're dead!

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.980
That's right! If Titans attack us again,
there'll be nothing left this time!

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.080
Not the company! Not our families!

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.500
Let's print the truth before that happens!

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:11.270
Just like it's written right there, it shows the
charges were bogus, they abused their power,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.370
and that King Fritz was a total fake.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.300
All our actions were justified self-defense.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.070
In other words, we're free people now.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.140
Woohoo!

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.890
No... This can't be...

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.500
Looks like the gamble paid off.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.730
Yeah.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.310
It wasn't just Erwin though.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.650
The lone choices of many
managed to change the world.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.580
And I managed to kill the
three people you loaned me.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.610
I'm sorry.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.630
The thing is, part of the Interior Police,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.840
their leader, Eren, and Historia are somewhere else.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.590
If we don't find them soon...

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:06.910
I may have a clue about that.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.590
Let's get there and put an end to this battle.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Underground Chapel"
"A sacred location where the royal family's power has been passed down for generations. The walls are composed of a naturally luminescent ore which is thought to have been created by some form of Titan power."

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.180
As a result of Erwin's actions,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.830
it was declared that the current
regime would be ousted.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.420
That announcement came immediately after

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.700
the military gained control of the
capital and administrative district.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:36.450
And took place upon the gallows
constructed specifically for him.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.040
That's right.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.170
It's exactly how Premier Zachary
explained in the speech.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.050
Understand that our goal
is not to establish military rule.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.510
In place of Fritz, a new ruler will
come from the true royal family.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.390
They will be the one responsible
for leading the people.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.390
I understand that well enough,

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.810
but do you really think people will simply
accept a new ruler just like that?

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.280
There're a lot of citizens out
there who are very worried.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.290
At this point, who do we trust?

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.150
As far as humanity's concerned,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.470
we should have let the government do as they please.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.700
Like Commander Pyxis was saying,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.530
they've somehow devised a means
of keeping humanity alive until now.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.610
Even if they watch as half of humanity dies,
it's better than us going extinct.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:35.970
Should I have let Eren go, risked my comrade's
lives, given up both my life and my duty,

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.350
and entrusted it all to the government?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.370
If humanity is more precious
than one single life...

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.430
Your duty is as painful as ever.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.400
Dying seems a far easier option.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.090
In that case, why didn't you do as you say?

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:59.540
That's...

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.780
Shall I tell you my reason?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.040
For a long time, I've hated those bastards!

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.700
Huh?

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.460
They piss me off!

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.640
Those pompous pricks and pigs
who think they're important...

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.510
No... Maybe I actually liked them.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.720
I've been dreaming for
this day to come for ages.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:25.100
That is... Even if you hadn't done it, I would've
given it a shot before I kicked the bucket.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.870
I couldn't care less if this coup d'état
is good or bad for humanity.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.690
I'm quite the scoundrel, right?

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.510
But you're no different than me.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.300
You didn't want to die.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:46.160
Just like me, you prioritize yourself
over the fate of humanity.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.970
I... must be very conceited to think that.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.520
What's your reason?

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.730
Now it's your turn to answer.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.570
I...

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.770
...have a dream.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.270
One I've had since I was a child...

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.240
Hange.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.080
You might know where they are?

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.280
Yeah, I'll explain.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.120
Erwin gave me this Scout investigation
report regarding Lord Reiss' land.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.130
Most of it has to do with an incident five
years ago that shook up the Reiss family.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.510
Five years ago?

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.910
Right. On the day Wall Maria was breached.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.690
I'll summarize the important
bits from the beginning.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.470
As the lord of his territory, popular opinion
of Rod Reiss wasn't all that bad.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.520
He had five children, and his eldest
daughter Frieda was a down-to-earth girl

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.710
that even the peasants adored.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.070
But that night, five years ago, disaster struck.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.120
With the world having plunged into pure chaos,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.810
some bandits raided and set fire
to the only chapel around.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.290
Unfortunately, that night, the entire
Reiss family was there praying together.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.290
And so, the whole family, save for
the head of the house, Rod Reiss...

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.010
...was massacred that night by the bandits.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:31.600
To top it off, this incident occurred
just a few days before Historia's mother

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.610
was killed by the Interior Police.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:41.040
In other words, immediately after losing
his family, Rod Reiss sought out Historia.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.650
There must be a reason he
and his lackeys are after Historia.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.150
The same bloodline?

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.540
Is there some secret to their blood?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.330
I don't know for sure yet.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.340
But what really makes me curious is that
parts of the chapel are completely wrecked.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.350
The chapel itself is stone. It would take
tons of time and effort to destroy it.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.960
Bandits would take what they can
and make a quick escape.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.320
Plus, the only one who saw those
bandits was Rod Reiss himself.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.420
Soon after, he used his own
fortune to rebuild the chapel.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.860
But why?

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:29.080
If you think about it, it's actually stranger
that there were no traces of Titans.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:33.620
Even if I'm jumping to conclusions,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.800
something this suspicious deserves us checking it out.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.150
What the hell?!

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.430
Before the night is over,
we'll have soldiers all over Reiss' land.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.530
Unfortunately, I doubt
he'll be waiting that long.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.320
If we don't hurry and get there,
Eren may end up being eaten.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.010
If a Titan eats a person who can change into
a Titan and thus inherits their powers...

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.980
If that's actually true...

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:44.820
When and how did Eren become a Titan,
and who did he eat to gain his powers?

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.370
Shit!

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.280
Historia?

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.940
To save Eren, Mikasa and the
others head for the Reiss chapel.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.900
However, the captured Eren finds out...

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:52.170
...his father, Grisha's, unforgivable sin.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:53.820
Next episode: "Sin."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Sin"
