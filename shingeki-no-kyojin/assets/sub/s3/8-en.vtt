00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.430
Levi and the Scouts clashed with Kenny's squad,
charging straight into their defense.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.900
All to reach and rescue Eren and Historia.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.990
However...

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.950
Fall back to the final defensive post!

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.490
Time to regroup!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.880
I'm praying, Historia.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.550
For God to lead and guide humanity!

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.920
God, my ass!

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.550
You're just giving yourself an out
and manipulating other people!

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.130
I've had it! I won't let you kill me!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.850
That's the spirit!

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.350
This is gettin' good!

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.690
You escape from here.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.730
I'll destroy everything else!

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.900
Father...

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.570
Uri...

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.190
Frieda...

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.970
Wait for me...

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.050
...now...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.010
"Outside the Walls of Orvud District"

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.880
It's gotta be a way through
if it's all plugged up.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.160
Shit.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.720
If only we had some gunpowder left...

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.440
We cannot let them through!

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.390
As long as we hold here, we're good!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.060
That's...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.170
A Titan transformed?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.370
Eren!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.850
Here it comes! Hang on tight!

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.400
Th-This place is gonna collapse!

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.190
Captain!

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.270
The hole!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.660
Armin! Moblit! Take Hange
and get the hell out of here!

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.370
Rod Reiss!

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.160
You bastard!

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.080
Forget it, Historia!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.710
Since that Titan's from the Reiss family,
just let him come and eat me!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.380
Get out of here!

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.220
Hell no!

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.970
Why won't you listen?!

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.720
I might be humanity's 
enemy, but I'm your ally!

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.520
I can't be a good girl,
and I don't wanna be God either!

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.230
But...

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.210
When I see people crying to themselves,
saying they're not needed...

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.020
...I wanna tell those people
that's just not true!

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.630
No matter who! No matter where!

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.490
I'll come to their rescue!

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.040
Historia!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.860
You okay?

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.300
Mikasa!

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.630
Give me the keys!

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.050
Captain? You guys...

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.860
Conny, hurry!

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.760
Forget about me!

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.680
Captain! Hurry and escape!

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.060
Shut up already, you topless wimp!

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.980
It's not just a Titan!
There're dudes with guns coming for us!

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.970
He's loose!

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.650
I think...

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.990
That's way bigger than
the Colossal Titan, isn't it?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.240
The ceiling...? Look out!

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.120
Get back!

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.510
Hey, hey, Rod! Ya done goofed up big time!

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.090
You thought ya knew Titans
more than the rest of us!

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.680
Now I know you didn't, ya dumb shit!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.390
Captain Ackermann!

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.140
Idiots! Get away!

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.030
Shit! There's no way out!

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:42.820
Why?

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.860
Wasn't he going to eat me?

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.510
Should I transform?

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.080
No... My Titan can't withstand all this...

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.030
I'm sorry, everyone...

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.370
I've been nothing but useless...

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.390
Ever since the very beginning,
I was never the hope of humanity...

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.230
Armor?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.070
What's this? Think you're some tragic hero?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.030
When have you ever accomplished
anything by your strength alone?

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.310
What a weakling.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.080
We've been through much worse than this.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.120
Not that I wanna get used to it!

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.810
Still, it's going to suck trying
to navigate through all that.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.840
I'll take Eren.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.510
We can't go nice and slow for you,
so hold on for your life.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.130
Right.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.720
It's useless. We can't escape.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.510
So do nothing?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.350
You wanna sit here and hold hands
till we're crushed or burn to death?

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.800
Because we're enemies of humanity?

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.010
You know, I hate doing this
to you every time, but...

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.400
Eren.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.540
You've gotta make the choice.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.910
I'll go with you!

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.710
Eren!

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.450
I'm sorry...

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.510
Since it's the end, just this once...
I want you to let me...

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.070
Let me believe in myself!

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.160
What... the...?

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.410
Everyone! Get underneath Eren!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.370
Caven!

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.470
The chapel!

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.280
Not good!

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.780
Let's try to run!

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.360
Section Commander! Are you okay?!

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.340
Yeah...

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.610
What in the world happened?

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.920
What the hell is that?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.530
If it's that big this far away...

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.700
It's gotta be twice as big
as the Colossal Titan.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.880
The wall won't stand a chance...

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.490
Commander?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:21.950
Advance!

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.600
Eren!

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.770
Eren!

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.180
Eren!

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.020
Eren!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.990
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Titan Hardening"
"An ability used by the Armored Titan and so forth, for a Titan to harden their body. While in hiding, Eren Jaeger conducted experiments to replicate this ability in order to plug Wall Maria. However, it wasn't until his attempt underground that he first succeeded in doing so."

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.490
That's what I call hardening.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.990
Even after cutting you away,
the Titan hasn't disappeared.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.550
Pretty impressive, yeah?

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.930
That bottle...

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:27.350
Oh, yeah! Right before I turned into
a Titan, I drank that "Armor" bottle...

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.240
Yeah.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.170
You couldn't do it at all before now,
but you used the hardening power.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.940
And saved all of us.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.200
In the blink of an eye,
you devised and built all this.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.790
Yeah, the construction looks shoddy, but...
I bet that's how the walls were made, too.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.880
In other words...

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.500
It's possible for us to plug
that hole in Wall Maria now.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.670
A lot of enemies and allies
have died on the way,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.510
and getting this far hasn't been pretty,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.270
but for as ugly as it's been,
look at the position we're in now.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.910
Retaking Wall Maria...

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.880
Once we do that,
we can investigate my basement.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.280
But, my dad was actually...

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.370
Captain!

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.450
We've secured an exit!

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.370
Armin's safe!

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.620
Hange and Moblit, too!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380
Well done.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:35.710
Eren!

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.010
You okay?

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.170
We're all safe, thanks to you!

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.970
But to be perfectly honest, when you ran
off prancing while crying like a baby...

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.680
...I thought we were doomed!

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.340
"It's over, over! Get it together, nincompoop!
Quit bawling like a snotty-nosed brat!"

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.190
is what I thought.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.790
Hey...

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.350
Let's go.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.110
We're going after that big-ass Titan.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.350
Eren!

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.800
It's no use! Stay back! We'll get burnt!

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.860
Commander, we can't stop it!

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.530
It's like an Abnormal and 
doesn't care about us!

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.260
Enough! Fall back!

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.440
All that matters for now is to find
out the direction it's heading.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.980
Commander Erwin! It's Squad Levi!

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.050
Eren and Historia are with them!
They succeeded!

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.220
Erwin.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.240
Everyone all right?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.890
Hange's our only casualty.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.490
Seems like nothing too serious.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.150
Well done, everyone.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.590
I've got a whole slew of things
to report, but first...

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:20.890
What's that Titan?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.900
It's Rod Reiss.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.360
I think we'll need your 
call on this, Commander.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.430
Regardless, we don't have time
to stand here and chat.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.360
Return to Wall Sina.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.380
You're going to let that big ass
crawl right up to the wall?

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.920
To Orvud District, actually.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.890
That's most likely where it's headed.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.790
Let's put this all together...

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.420
Basically, Rod Reiss was after the Founding
Titan, the Titan power inside Eren.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.480
However, unless it's in someone with Reiss
blood, you won't get its true potential.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:37.350
Though, even if a Reiss obtains
the Founding Titan's power,

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:42.940
they're controlled by the First King's will and
refuse to liberate humanity from the Titans.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.460
Eh? Well, isn't that interesting...

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.710
According to the First 
King, this is true peace?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.830
Now that's a weird way to look at it.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.080
In other words... we still have an option.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.520
If that Titan eats me,
Rod Reiss will return to a human.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.190
Which means it's still possible
to have a true Founding Titan.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.180
You can't...

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.300
Seems that way.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.540
We could capture Rod Reiss
once he becomes a human.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.870
Undo the First King's brainwashing.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:25.570
If we could do that, it might open
a path to save humanity.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.920
Plus, Eren...

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.960
Are you saying you're fully
prepared to let that happen?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.590
I am.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.830
Eren, you can't...

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.280
You're forgetting our other option.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.220
First of all, the current 
plan is full of flaws.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.380
One, there's no proof that you can
undo Rod Reiss' brainwashing.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.940
No matter how you restrain him,
if he alters humanity's memories, it's over.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.890
Basically, there's too many factors about
the Founding Titan that we just don't know.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.300
True...

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:18.040
Even if Rod Reiss eats Eren, we have
no guarantee that he'll return to normal.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:18.950
Mmm.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.920
On the other hand, all we've ever
known is destructive pacifists.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.420
But as it stands, the Founding Titan
was taken from them.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.140
This is a once in a lifetime 
chance for humanity.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.550
Yes...

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.570
Your father was trying to save us
and humanity from the First King.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.230
He stole the Founding Titan from my sister...

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.770
...murdered all of the Reiss children...

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.580
...because he had no other choice.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.530
If you want to save Mikasa,
Armin, and everyone else...

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.410
...you must learn to control this ability!

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.450
Dad...

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.180
That's right!

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.090
The Dr. Jaeger I know wouldn't do
something like that for no reason at all.

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.290
Right. Even without having Reiss blood,
there must be a way to save humanity.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.340
That's why he left you 
the key to the basement.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.600
What basement?

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.600
Oh, that whole thing?
You mean it's actually important?

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.980
Uh, yeah...

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.310
We've finally got a way to plug up the wall.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.740
The way I see it, there's only one choice.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.910
That makes life a little easier.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.270
If it means anything, I 
agree with that choice.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.220
Though, are you sure about this, Historia?

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.760
We can't exactly have a Titan like that
wandering around inside the walls.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.820
One that big, we can't restrain.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.750
Meaning...

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:01.180
We'll have to kill your father
and there's no way around it.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.650
Eren.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.340
I'm sorry.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.700
Eh?

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.700
Underneath the Reiss chapel...

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:35.460
...I really considered becoming
a Titan and killing you.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.120
What's more, not even to save humanity...

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.790
Only because I wanted to believe my father.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.370
I didn't want my father to hate me...

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.630
But now, it's time to say goodbye.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.540
"Orvud District - Regiment Branch"

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.450
Please gather your squad in the hall.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.200
The strategy meeting is about to begin.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.640
All right.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.170
Historia. Forgot to tell you...

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:28.760
We need you to do something.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.230
Yes?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.450
Erwin's orders.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.860
When this battle is over, since you're
the true successor to the throne...

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.980
...become the Queen.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.280
Eh?

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.410
Huh?

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.360
Q-Queen?! Historia?!

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:52.000
The coup d'état was successful, but the people
won't follow a regiment sitting at the top.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.840
What we need is a story to spread.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.600
That a true heir retook
the crown from the fake.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.000
I...

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.510
Um, Captain?

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.270
I'm sure you heard what
Historia said earlier, but...

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.590
Well, uh...

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:17.260
By leaving her father, she finally broke free
from that burden, I guess you could say...

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.110
And yet, again...

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.870
What?

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.450
If you have something to say, say it.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.650
Uh, um...

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.310
I-In other words...

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.120
Conny's trying to say...

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.250
Historia broke free from the Reiss
family and has finally found herself.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.210
And now you're forcing her
into another role? Isn't that...?

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:41.470
Isn't that... not fair to her?

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.420
All right.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:42.970
Eh?

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.390
My next duty is to be Queen, right?

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.370
Understood.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.720
Historia...

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.450
Thanks for your concern.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:21:00.730
But whether or not it's forced on me
is up to me to decide, I think.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.080
However...

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.120
Captain, I do have one condition.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.350
Hmm?

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.330
Since my fate is my own,
I want to lay it all on the line.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.830
When you're Queen,
you can punch that runt in the face.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.520
We've determined the location
of Rod Reiss' Titan.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.320
It's southwest, approaching Orvud.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.140
At this rate, it should reach
Orvud District by dawn.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.570
Understood.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.690
Commander Erwin, we'd all
like to hear what your plan is.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.060
How do you intend to evacuate
the citizens in time?

00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.910
We won't evacuate.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.450
Wh-What?

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.990
We'll have the citizens remain in
Orvud District just as they are.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.710
Uh...

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.180
Are you insane?

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:45.330
At Orvud District, Eren and the others
face off against Rod Reiss' Titan.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.860
Meanwhile, Historia is determined
to decide her own fate.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.140
Next episode: "Ruler of the Walls."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Ruler of the Walls"
