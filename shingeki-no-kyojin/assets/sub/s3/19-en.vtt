00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.940
"The Basement"

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.870
Armin! Get down!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.920
It hurts...

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.250
It hurts so bad...

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.530
Bertholdt...

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.290
It hurts...

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.300
It hurts so bad...

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.720
Sasha?

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.050
Sasha!

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.810
You're in terrible shape... What happened...?

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.390
Armin!

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.770
Eren?

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.320
I'm glad... you're back!

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.600
Huh?

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.680
You're up?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.440
Captain!

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.730
What in the world happened here?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.570
I remember... Bertholdt becoming a Titan...

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.550
What about the others?! Are they okay?!

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.970
That's as far back as you remember?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.180
Huh?

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.090
Eren, tell him everything.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.710
Well? Up to speed, Armin?

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.800
Are you telling me... the Scout Regiment...

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.840
...is the nine of us here... and that's it?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.760
For the time being.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.290
The fighting ended four hours ago.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.700
We've been looking for survivors,
but... none yet...

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.240
S-So, we managed to seal
the walls of Shiganshina...

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.650
But Reiner, the Beast Titan,
and one other escaped...

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.240
Bertholdt was captured...

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.540
Then... there was a dispute...

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.250
...about using the injection on
Commander Erwin or me...

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.450
And I...

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.750
...turned into a Titan and ate B-Bertholdt...

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.300
Here.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.700
Why... did you pick me?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.370
No matter how you look at it,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.250
wasn't Commander Erwin
the right one to bring back?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.330
Captain! Why did you give me the injection?!

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.570
Tsk!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.960
I told you to tell him everything.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.290
The thing is, it seems your two
friends here didn't think that way.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.020
They stood up to me... 
prepared to draw blood.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.810
Huh?

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.840
We'll take whatever punishment comes.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.000
You'll be disciplined for
insubordination, but...

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.070
Does taking the punishment
allow you to do anything?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.020
No...

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.620
However...

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.380
The final decision to choose you was mine.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.860
No...

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.410
I chose this to be the 
place where Erwin dies.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.690
I don't understand...

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.020
There's no way it's okay to let Erwin die...

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.150
If the commander is gone,
how... how will we go on?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.810
I agree. I thought it should've
been used on Erwin...

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.770
...if we're being brutally honest.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.800
No... It's a shame we were
put in that position...

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.160
Anyways, Erwin entrusted Levi
with the decision to use it.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.980
And Levi ended up choosing you.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.210
There's nothing more to say.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.780
Erwin's life and a Titan's power
rest on your shoulders.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.930
No matter what anyone says,
that's part of who you are now, Armin.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.480
Does that mean... I need to be...
Erwin's replacement?

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.840
No way... I can't...

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.360
Don't get me wrong.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.330
You'll never be Erwin's replacement.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.810
But...

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.570
...I know you have a strength
that nobody else has but you.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.640
I won't regret my decision.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.500
However, don't make these guys regret it.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.500
Nor anyone else.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.770
And don't regret it yourself, either.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.970
That is your mission.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.480
Shut up!

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.190
We're no match for Sasha.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.460
Well, being the successor of Erwin
as commander of the Scouts,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.340
we're kinda in the same boat.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.000
From here on out,
we'll have to grin and bear it.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.960
Right...

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:12.630
Now then...

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.260
If it's not a problem for Armin,
we should get going.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.890
Levi, Eren, Mikasa, and 
I will go investigate.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.400
You other four keep watch
from atop Shiganshina's wall.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.030
Roger.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.730
Eren. Do you still have the key?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.160
Yeah.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.310
Right here.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.270
Eren...

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.920
When I get back,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.450
I'll show you the basement that
I've kept secret all this time.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:45.420
Hey, Eren!

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.140
How many times must I say
you can't go in the basement?!

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.200
Why aren't I allowed to?!

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.380
Because your father keeps 
his work tools there.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.340
Medicine, too.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.610
It's dangerous for children.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.530
Tsk...

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.480
Your intentions are the key.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.410
The key to saving humankind 
from this despair.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.080
We have reason to believe that the
basement of his home in Shiganshina...

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:23.130
...houses a secret of the Titans
that not even <i>he</i> is aware of.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.380
If we can just reach this basement,
we may be able to obtain information

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.260
that will help us break free from
the Titans' century-long tyranny.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.700
Hey, where's your house?

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.000
R-Right...

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.690
Is this it?

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.510
Hey, Dad!

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.340
When will you show me
what's in the basement?

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:29.970
Who knows?

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.510
Perhaps when you realize
the most important thing of all.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.000
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Basement Key"
"Grisha Jaeger, having come from outside the walls and thus knowing many secrets, entrusted the basement key to his son. The basement will likely reveal the mysteries of the world which Grisha couldn't mention to anyone."

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.340
Luckily, the fires didn't make it this far.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.320
Right here.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.310
Under this are the stairs to the basement.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.570
Good.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.930
That's a relief. It's not flooded with water.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:55.870
Let's go.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.050
Eren.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:19.070
Right.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.230
What's wrong?

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.470
Eren?

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.890
Hurry it up.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.520
This... This key...
It doesn't go to this door...

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.730
What?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.550
You're kidding... I'm certain that's
the key Dr. Jaeger had.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.320
Step aside.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.400
I'll open it.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.780
Huh? Wait...

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.010
Hold up...

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.140
It almost feels like a laboratory down here.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:24.060
My dad was a doctor, so... he was always
cooped up down here mixing medicine.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.070
That makes sense.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:34.410
In fact, if this medicine is all labeled
correctly, it's stuff that's widely available.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:39.120
And since all the books here relate to medicine,
at first glance, it's just a doctor's study.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.190
"There's nothing suspicious here."

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.130
It's like that's what he
wants people to think.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.190
Yeah...

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.620
If you're hiding stuff from the Interior Police,
you wouldn't want it out in the open.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.390
Hey. Quit standing around, brats.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.790
Erwin's hunches are rarely wrong.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:00.470
Right.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.900
Thanks, Mikasa. It's another all-nighter.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.550
Eren...

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.340
There's a keyhole right here.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.120
Eren.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:49.620
It opened.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.370
It's empty?!

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.370
Look closer.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.220
It's a false bottom.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.980
It smells like peppermint oil and charcoal.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.550
Were these treated to keep
moisture and bugs away?

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.010
We were looking for something...

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:17.660
and these must be it.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.090
I wonder what it was
my dad wanted to show me.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.510
That's when Erwin asked this question...

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.290
"How do we know there's not
more humans outside the walls?"

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.100
He insisted that as long as we haven't
been able to freely explore the outside,

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:13.030
we can't know for sure if humanity
was completely wiped out by Titans.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.660
And yet, history books declare
the rest were wiped out.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.260
Hmm?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.290
If you consider that history books
should maintain an objective viewpoint,

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.280
it should read, "It is believed
the rest of humanity was wiped out."

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.130
You're just trying to find fault
in anything and everything.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.090
I'm not! There's intent behind it!

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.800
For example...

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.620
To make us believe that humanity
doesn't exist outside the walls.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.170
That is, by the royal government
that issues the books.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.510
You're overthinking it.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.330
This is what they call splitting hairs.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.520
I was teasing him back then,
but look at us now...

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.010
You'll just have to apologize
to the man himself.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.790
In not too long, it'll be dawn.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.490
If our heroes were to return,
it's about that time...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.790
The Scouts returned just a moment ago!

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.050
They successfully took back Wall Maria!

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.430
This is... a portrait?

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.770
Let me see that.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.040
No... It's far too detailed for this
to be drawn by a person.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.380
That's Dr. Jaeger's writing.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.140
"This is no illustration.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.300
Instead, this uses light
reflected off a subject...

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.300
...and burns the image on special paper.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.360
It's called a photograph.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.180
I come from a place outside"...

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.980
...the walls where humanity 
lives in elegance.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.200
Humanity has not perished.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.490
I pray the person who finds
this book is a fellow patriot.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.940
Hurry, Fay! We'll lose it unless we're fast!

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.630
Wait up, Grisha!

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.320
You two stop right there.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.250
I told you not to forget
your armbands when you go outside.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.710
Grisha, you absolutely 
must not leave the walls.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:56.830
Hey, wait!

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.000
I got it, Mom!

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.630
We'll be back!

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.620
Come on!

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.540
When I first thought as to how
I should start my story...

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.170
...I immediately thought of that day.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:19.760
Hey!

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.070
--Whoa!
--Sorry!

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.900
Grisha, be careful! Watch where you're going!

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.030
Oh... It's leaving...

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.880
Must be nice...

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.750
Someday when I'm rich, will I be able
to ride on an airship, too?

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.420
What are you talking about?
There's no way either of us will get rich.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.680
Yeah...

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.670
But it must be nice...

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.760
I wonder what we could see from up there.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.860
There it goes...

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.490
Let's go, Fay!

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.580
Huh?!

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:17.710
My teacher said the airships take off
and land at a place near here!

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:18.500
Let's go see!

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.380
What?! But Mom said we're
not allowed to leave the walls!

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.960
It'll be fine! Just for a bit!

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.840
--We'll be right back!

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.970
--Hey! Get back here!
--We'll be right back!

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.520
That naive day of my youth...

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.060
...when I...

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.410
...had to face the truth of this world.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:46.530
His story began with pulling his sister's hand
while gazing upwards at the sky.

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.360
The hatred and hope reflected in
his eyes show Eren a cruel world.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.520
Next episode: "That Day."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"That Day"
