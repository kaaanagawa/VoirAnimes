WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.940
Yo, Levi.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.440
You grown any yet?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.280
Oh? It don't look like you changed at all!

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.160
Kenny!

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.290
Kaboom!

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.980
"Pain"

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.680
Gunshots?!

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.070
What's going on?!

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.270
Stay in there! Hiyaah!

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.830
Historia!

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.210
Eren!

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.230
Hiyaah!

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.020
Shit! They predicted every 
last one of our movements!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.740
Kenny... What the hell is he doing
in the Military Police?!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.560
It's Levi... of the Scouts!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.640
W-Welcome to our establishment!

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.080
Oof!

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.300
Shit... If this keeps up, I'll lose
my team, Eren, and Historia too.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.480
Tsk!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.490
Ain't that the damnedest thing!
I smell a filthy rat coming from this bar...

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.010
Come out, you little rodent...

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.410
Found ya!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.250
The law has come to exterminate the vermin!

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.940
Bang! Bang!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.960
Eek!

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.880
The hell?! Ain't you here?!

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.260
Right here, Kenny. It's been a while.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.390
Never thought you'd still be alive.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.260
What happened to slaughtering the
Military Police? Now you're one of them?

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.140
Adults do plenty of things a kid
like you can't understand.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.850
Oops, my bad.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.570
You're just so tiny, it's hard
to believe you're older now.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.900
I been looking forward 
to seeing you in action.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.570
Never thought all those tricks I taught you
would be helping you out like this.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.080
Didn't I ever tell you what 
happens to a cornered rat?

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.580
No matter which way you try to run,
you'll get blasted from above.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.260
Hey, Levi...

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.820
There's gotta be a reason you became a Scout,
and I think I know what it is.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.640
We had no choice but to 
survive in that garbage dump.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.780
It took all we had each day to keep livin'.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.290
And when we found out how big the world
really was, you can bet it hurt like hell.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.630
But something saved us...

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.050
We'd found something we
wanted to do. It's that simple.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.340
It's simple, but the truth is...

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.910
The only thing that made our lives 
fulfilling was finding hobbies.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.670
Hobbies? So is blowing the heads
off my team another hobby of yours?

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.430
Yup... To achieve my grand goals,
I'll kill as much as I have to.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.300
You're no different.
You kill when it benefits you, too.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.200
Yeah...

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.230
Wait!

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.720
Captain...

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.480
Thanks, Old Man.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.450
A chair?!

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.950
--What?!

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.200
--Fire!
--What?!

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.420
Gunshots!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.420
Huh?

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.360
From there!

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.320
I heard a bunch of shots!

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.190
You think something happened?

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.650
Most likely.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.850
The Captain had this message for us...

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.680
From now on, we'll be fighting
humans, too, and not just Titans.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.980
Huh? You mean...?

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.320
Hey!

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.040
Hmm?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.890
Was that the First Interior Squad?

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.500
Commander. You're needed 
to check some papers.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.500
Captain.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.750
Finally bit the dust?

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.590
You moron... How would I 
answer that if I'm dead?

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.900
Ow, ow, ow... He got me good.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.970
Forgot that bar owners are allowed to
keep guns for their own self-defense...

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.680
For a runt, he's sure grown up.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.270
That's wonderful.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.480
Huh?! Like hell it is!

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.730
My dream is getting further 
and further away...

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.490
Hey! There goes Eren!

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.990
Captain!

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.790
What the hell?!

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.300
Chase the wagon!

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.050
Yes, sir!

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.390
--Listen up! They're used 
to fighting other people!

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.680
--Hiyaah!
--Listen up! They're used to fighting other people!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.220
They already got three of ours.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.440
If we're gonna get those two back,
you can't hesitate!

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.860
If you get the chance, you kill! Got it?!

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:47.780
Roger!

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.460
Tsk!

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.700
Armin, Jean! Secure the 
wagon! We'll cover you!

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.330
Sir!

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.580
Another dead...

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.750
Jean!

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.800
Don't move!

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.050
You...

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.310
Jean!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.940
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Anti-Personnel omni-directional mobility gear"
"This device was developed not to exterminate Titans but to directly counter ODM gear for use in fighting other humans. With speed exceeding human perception and allowing one to attack from blind spots, the device exhibits tremendous dominance in cities and forests."

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.320
"Capital Mitras"

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.460
How disappointing that nothing came of Erwin.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.360
We still don't know the location
of Eren Jaeger and Historia.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.960
At this rate, freezing Scout activity
will prove all for naught.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.250
Indeed...

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.700
Do we know what information they
might have learned from Pastor Nick?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.640
No helping it.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:59.390
If we question too much, we'll reveal to them
things they didn't know in the first place.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.220
No, what they know or don't know matters not.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.560
It's what they tried to learn. That's plenty.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.670
We should deal with them 
to the extent of the law.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.070
Just as we've done until now...

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.000
It's from Lord Reiss.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.450
Eren and Historia have been captured.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.710
He's already moved against Erwin
and the Scout Regiment.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.340
There's no need for us to take action.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.210
That's the last of it.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.340
If you want your personal 
effects back, ask later.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.930
No, it's fine.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.260
I was hoping to speak with you.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.310
I'm in no mood to reminisce about the past.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.020
How cold of you, Nile.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.730
Weren't we once comrades aiming to be Scouts?

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.570
This tiny world is about to change.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.950
Will it bring hope, or despair?

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.950
Can we trust the government with
the future of humanity or not?

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.280
Who gets to choose?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.430
Who decides?

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.290
Who will you trust?

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.210
Erwin, you... What are you planning to do?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.520
Gamble, like I always do.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.570
Did you go through this, too?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.980
Sorry...

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.660
It's okay.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.630
Sorry... Sorry...

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.000
Shit! Armin! Jean!

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.620
Don't do it! Fall back!

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.400
Eren!

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.220
What's wrong?

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.830
This grimy place kill your appetite?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.120
No...

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.960
Jean, there's something I don't understand...

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.540
What's that?

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.810
When I shot that gun to save you...

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.010
I honestly thought I didn't make it in time.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.590
Sorry, but...

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.580
why was I the one who shot first?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.460
That's...

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.490
Because the other person hesitated.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.190
It's true.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:04.200
Armin, I'm sorry... I should've 
done what I had to do.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.660
I know what it is...

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.790
The person that I killed...
I bet they were a nice person.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.550
Someone that was much more human than I am...

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.590
I pulled the trigger so easily... I did...

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.250
I'm...

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.320
Armin, you've got blood on your hands now.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.830
You can't go back to who you were.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.020
Why would you say that?

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.040
Embrace the new you.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.060
Just think, if your hands were still clean...

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.070
Jean wouldn't be here right now.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:48.330
I'll tell you why you pulled the trigger...
Because your comrade was about to die.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.040
Armin...

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.830
Thanks to you getting blood on your hands,
nobody on our squad ended up dead.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.840
Thank you.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.360
Captain Levi, I...

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.220
I thought it was
wrong to be fighting other humans...

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.510
And wrong for you to order us to do it.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.120
I was afraid to be hurting other people.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.270
But... I'm the one who was wrong.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.110
Next time, I'll shoot.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.680
I never said anything about 
who was right or wrong.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.430
I don't even know myself.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.580
Are you really the one in the wrong?

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.350
Now then...

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.840
It's about time we hear what he has to say.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.890
Wait! I'm just an old man used
for moving wagons around the--

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.490
I've met this man once before.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.430
In the city, people were calling him Boss.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.770
Yeah, I know. Dimo Reeves, right?

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.900
Tsk!

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.910
We were just following orders the Military Police
forced on us. And failed big time...

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.910
They'll plunder the Reeves Company
for all that it's worth.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:19.530
They won't stop with me and my dumb son. They'll
make sure all my employees die in so-called accidents.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.640
So you'll die without a fight?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.010
Trost should have collapsed by now,
but it's persevered.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.070
That's because the Reeves Company
brings people and work together.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.270
But if the company was gone for good,
just how few would survive the winter?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.810
Are you suggesting I team up with you?

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.340
We just need to know where 
Eren and Historia are.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:47.280
If you're supplying the Military Police,
we can figure something out.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.660
But can you can stop my city and
employees from dying of starvation?

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.830
I can't guarantee it.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.540
However, you can trust that
we'll move towards that end.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.370
Finally, the nuisance is gone.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.510
Erwin, big trouble! The situation got worse!

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.760
There's two things! The first is that
Eren and Historia were abducted!

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.600
Three on my team were killed, too.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.070
I'm planning to meet up with Levi to see
if we can hunt down their location.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.480
And? The other?

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.360
Eren remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt, but..

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.280
Shit, if this is true...

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.940
My head's gonna explode!

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.160
Calm down!

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.790
What's the problem?

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.090
If we don't rescue him 
quick, Eren will get eaten!

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.430
Hey! Are Levi and them actually there?

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:59.270
They are. I promised him I'd cooperate,
so they let us go for some reason.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.790
Are we there?

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.530
Reeves, you damn--

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.350
Sorry about that, pals.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.340
What now? Does this really 
mean we're safe, Old Man?

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.800
There's no guarantee.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.550
You're kidding! Then why?!

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.260
A merchant must learn to follow their nose.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.060
Not just to smell easy money,
but to sniff out profit awaiting in the future.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.770
Once you find it, bite and don't let go.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.270
Got it? Remember that.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.650
Sorry, I'm late! You're still going at it?

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.530
Yeah, I'm pretty new to this.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:58.990
Sannes! You should know I'm also a novice
at human torture, so please bear with me!

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.290
Wait! What do you even want?!

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.820
Who the hell tortures 
without asking questions?!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.960
Oh, right... We do have 
some questions for you.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.340
Where are Eren and Historia?

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.510
Why are you after Historia?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.760
What's the Reiss Family?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.640
Too slow! Can't you see 
that we're in a hurry?!

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:21.230
It starts again...

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.270
I feel like the screams are louder
than when the captain did it.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.150
Even though I know it's to save
those two, it makes me sick.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.110
Let's face it... We're criminals now.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.890
The enemies that we're fighting...

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.090
We're not killing them because 
they're trying to eat us.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.330
It's because their views are different...

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.560
No, just the group they belong to.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.500
And for that, their lives...

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.080
Armin...

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.970
All of us... We're not good people anymore.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.390
Sorry, I can't peel nails as well as you.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.980
Just how many did you peel to get so good?

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.890
Too many to count.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.770
Within these cramped walls, do you know
why war has never broken out?

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:21.240
It's because the First Interior Squad
dirtied our hands to protect the peace.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.250
A teacher too smart for their own good...

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.620
A stupid couple who tried to fly...

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.250
A whore from some ranch in the sticks!

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.000
Humanity has only made it this far
because we erased them!

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.590
You should be thanking us!

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.050
I've never seen anyone get more pleasure out
of torture than you guys!

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.320
You're monsters!

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.350
But I'm not even afraid.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.310
I... I have...

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:54.980
I have the King, I... I believe in
the King and peace in the walls.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:58.320
That all the things we've 
done were justified...

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.320
But...

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.730
To think it hurt this much...

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.170
Go on and torture me to death already.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.840
That's all I ever did with this
blood-stained life of mine.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.210
Time for a break.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.490
That's troubling... I'm beginning 
to feel sorry for him.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.910
Quit shoving me. It hurts...

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.880
Ralph!

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.570
You're pathetic. It only took 
one nail to make you talk.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.120
Sannes doesn't have any nails left.
You're nothing like him.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.330
Like I care? That was his decision.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:51.120
The guy never shuts up about peace
and the King. The rest of us hate him.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.790
Do us a favor and kill him already.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.920
We're not letting it happen
until he verifies your story.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.050
You already got what you wanted
out of me. Gimme a break.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:07.060
Will I be getting a bed in my cell, or what?

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.530
Ready, Sannes? Let's try again.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.120
This is tough for me, too, 
but I'll do my best to--

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.380
Reiss is the true royal family.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.970
So much for trying not to stand out...

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.570
Flegel is taking forever, dammit.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.610
Merchants shouldn't be sellouts
when it comes to trust.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.200
Was it wise not to ask him where Levi is?

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.120
He'll show up even if we do nothing.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.660
How do you know?

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.500
Because I raised him.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500
Levi Ackermann is just that kind of guy.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.350
The true royal successor...

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.010
...is Historia?

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:38.150
In other words, both Eren and Historia
are likely wherever Rod Reiss is.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.360
That's him.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:51.790
Historia...

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.460
I'm sorry for everything...

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.880
A girl's past...

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.040
It's a secret big enough 
to change the kingdom...

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.510
Once this secret is known to Erwin,
he remembers a past of his own.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.540
Next Episode: "Old Story."
