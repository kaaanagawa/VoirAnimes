WEBVTT

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.250
H-Hey...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.960
Those houses will drop on us.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.710
You think one of those houses... is Eren's?

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.050
Eren's house...

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.710
...is eavesdropping!

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970
Sasha, could you smack Conny?

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.180
I don't think he knows our location.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.170
Yeah.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.270
He's making Shiganshina a sea of flames
by scattering burning debris.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.320
That bastard...

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.120
This time, you think you 
can burn down my city?!

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.160
A-Armin! The fire! Your orders?!

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.290
Hurry it up!

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.710
I can tell.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.630
You're standing there shaking so much,
you can't do a damn thing.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.470
Jean, can you take my place?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.970
I just have no idea.... what to do...

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.210
I was wrong reading Bertholdt,
and look where it got us.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.980
Jean! You're better suited for this!

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.360
The river! Move to the river!

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.060
Everyone aboard Eren! Conserve our gas!

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.680
Eren.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.170
At some point, we'll have to
get Bertholdt's attention,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.880
but until then, don't let him see you.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.280
Armin.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.510
I'm all right at reading situations,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.890
but I'm coming up empty
with a plan to get us out of this.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.720
In the end, we're all counting on you.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.990
"Perfect Game"

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.370
We're done cleaning up here.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.790
The only small ones left
are the ones way at the front.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.860
Still, how will we take down the Beast Titan?

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.930
He's perfectly content sitting
way over there, not moving an inch.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.010
Yeah, it seems he's a coward.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.870
Not like he's ever had balls to begin with.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.940
You take a break.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.980
We'll mop up the rest of the small ones.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.980
Let's go!

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.060
Roger!

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:20.600
Shit...

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.810
What was that explosion?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.860
What happened to those guys?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.570
Did Hange and the others avoid it?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.450
I've gotta hurry to that side and...

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.380
Hmm...

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.180
That one was a little bit high...

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.660
Oh, leave it right there.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.410
Well, the first pitch was a warm-up.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.870
I'm going for a perfect game!

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.800
Frontal bombardment!

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.960
All troops, take cover!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.050
Huh?

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.800
What was that?

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.870
Shit! You guys!

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.790
What the hell was that sound?!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.710
Does the enemy have cannons?!

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.620
If so, there's a hundred of 'em!

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.460
Calm down! You're scaring the horses!

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.270
The Titan's throwing boulders!

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.840
Captain Levi!

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.760
All of you, retreat to 
the wall with the horses!

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.890
Roger!

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.190
Hurry! Stay outta the line of fire!

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.530
Hey, stand up! You wanna die?!

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.240
Commander!

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.490
How's it looking?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.410
Terrible.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.420
His throws have destroyed
the front line of houses.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.350
If he keeps on throwing,
everything will get leveled.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.000
We won't have anywhere left to hide.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.160
We can't retreat to the 
other side of the wall?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.180
No...

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.530
The Colossal Titan is 
already heading this way.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.710
Spreading fire all along his path.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.700
Supposing we scale the wall to evade
the stones, we'd have to leave the horses.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.620
If we retreat here, there's 
no hope for victory.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.190
What happened to Hange's group?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.360
Is Eren all right?

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.430
I don't know.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.940
But the majority of them
were caught in that explosion.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.870
We've been dealt a serious blow.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.250
The Beast Titan directed the small Titans
so our soldiers would group up in one place.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:29.470
As such, while engaging the small Titans,
Dirk Squad, Marlene Squad, and Klaus Squad

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.760
were all wiped out by the bombardment.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.010
In other words, our remaining forces
this side of the gate...

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.240
...consists of you new Scout recruits,
Captain Levi, and...

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.590
...me.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.570
We're doomed!

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.090
Erwin... Do you have any sort of plan?

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.240
Yell at him, Eren!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.910
Don't let Bertholdt get 
any closer to the wall!

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.800
He noticed!

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.640
What?! That bastard's ignoring us!

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.980
Hey! What now, Jean?! At this rate...

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.180
I know that!

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.440
Eren! Go stop his lanky legs!

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.610
But still! How the hell
are we gonna defeat him?!

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:37.740
His gusts of hot steam make
our ODM gear useless! Right?!

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.380
You don't think I know that?!

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.250
But right now, we've got 
no choice but to try!

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.500
We've gotta figure out his weakness!

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.420
I'll do it. You guys distract him.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.760
Conny, your Thunder Spear.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.420
R-Right!

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.890
Armin, we need you to observe him from afar.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.300
So quit your moping.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.500
We gotta believe there's a way to beat him!

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.640
Right!

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.590
Now! Scatter!

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.980
Don't you dare look down on me!

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.310
You're nothing more...

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.080
...than a big damn wretched oaf!

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.220
H-He's shoving him!

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.590
Go, Eren! Knock him over!

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.310
There has to be some sort of way!

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.060
What?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.370
Eren!

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.550
Hey... Is that Eren?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.930
He got himself flung on top of the wall?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.750
By him...

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.090
Eren's not moving...

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.590
He's not dead! Focus on the monster at hand!

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.480
That might have been pushing it too far...

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.850
If we run at him without a plan,
that's what happens.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.890
Unless...

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.270
Unless we can somehow turn the tables on him,
this recovery operation, all of our lives,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.820
and the future of humanity will be doomed!

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.240
Having said that, I'm not about to sit
around while we all get slaughtered!

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.330
Let's go on the attack!

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.830
He doesn't know about Thunder Spears yet!

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.220
Conny, Sasha, and I will distract him!

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.670
Mikasa will strike in the opening!

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.460
Roger!

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.130
Hey, moron! I'll poke out your stupid eyes!

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.090
You huge idiot!

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.140
You massive pervert lord!

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.400
This distraction is so obvious...

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.280
But if we nail him with a Thunder Spear...!

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.680
Guys!

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.540
Is it useless?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.460
His hot steam even knocked
away the Thunder Spears!

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.430
Conny!

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.350
Shit! Breathing it in burned my throat!

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.680
Mikasa! You're bleeding!

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.480
I'm fine. A bit of shrapnel from
the Thunder Spears got me.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.980
Thought of anything yet?

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:54.480
Huh?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.480
Have any clues for a counterattack?

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.530
Not one...

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The Colossal Titan's Steam"
"A Titan's special powers are produced by using its own body as a resource. In that way, it is thought the steam emitted by the Colossal Titan consumes muscle tissue and therefore must be finite."

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.390
The Beast Titan has a good
guess where we're at.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.690
This place will look like a honeycomb soon.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.660
Erwin.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.430
If you're saying we've got no chance to
counterattack, let's get ready to flee.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.310
Wake Eren sprawled out up there.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.420
Ride him and flee with
as many people as possible.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.040
At least we'll have some survivors.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.920
Hey! The horse got away!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.770
That was your job!

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.300
Shut up! Like it matters!

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.510
Excuse me?!

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.880
Those Scouts were insanely strong
and they died in an instant!

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.340
You know as well as I do!

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.030
What good is protecting horses...

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.630
...when there's nobody 
left to ride them home?!

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.000
It all made sense at one point...

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.370
If humanity just hid behind the walls,

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.460
we'd someday get slaughtered
by Titans out of nowhere.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.250
Somebody has to bite the bullet
and risk taking action.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.140
In order for others to not become victims,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.550
we needed people to become
the victims themselves.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.630
Who will be that brave soldier?

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.850
When I was asked that, I actually
believed I could be that someone!

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.650
But I never thought...

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.210
...that being sent to my death...

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.020
...would turn out to be so
utterly meaningless in the end!

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.150
Now that I think about it,

00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.260
I bet almost everyone ends up
saying the same thing as me.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.800
Why did I ever think that I'd...

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.750
...somehow be different?

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.230
What if whoever's left of the recruits
and Hange's group scatter on horses...

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.120
...and try to make it home?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.490
By using them as a decoy,
you guys could escape on Eren.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.350
Levi. What would you do?

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.110
I'm facing the Beast Titan.
I'll draw him away--

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.020
Impossible.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.340
You won't even get close.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.200
Probably not.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:53.400
But if you and Eren return
home alive, there's still hope.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.290
Isn't that the best we can
ask for at this point?

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.830
What a huge defeat...

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.040
To be perfectly honest,

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.880
I doubt a single one of us
is making it back alive.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.880
Yes, assuming we had no way to counterattack.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.930
Is there a way?

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.440
Yes.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.140
Why didn't you say that sooner?

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.100
Why'd you keep your shitty mouth shut?

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:29.610
If the plan goes well, you may be able
to take down the Beast Titan.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:31.530
But it will take the recruits...

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.960
...and myself to give our lives.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.210
It's like you said.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.320
Either way, most of us will die.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:49.560
No, it's almost guaranteed
we'll all be wiped out.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.970
In which case, we can stake our heroic
deaths on a slim chance of victory.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.890
For this to work...

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.510
To ask these young ones to die,

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.500
it would take an expert con man
and a whole slew of lies.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.930
If I do not lead the vanguard,
none of them will follow.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.500
And I will die before anyone else.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.490
Without ever learning 
what's in the basement...

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:20.780
Huh?

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.430
I...

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.120
I want to go to the basement.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.160
Everything I've done till now...

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.430
...was because I thought this day would come.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:43.280
That someday, I could check if I was right.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.950
So many times... I thought death
would be so much easier.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.410
But always, the dream I shared with
my father flashed through my mind.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:17:00.170
And now, I'm close enough to the
answers to reach out and grab them.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.250
They're right there...

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.560
But, Levi...

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.670
Can you see them? Our comrades?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.810
Our comrades are looking at us.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.500
They want to know what became
of the hearts they gave.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.150
Because the fighting isn't over yet.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.730
Is it all just inside my head?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.760
Nothing more than a childish delusion?

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.940
You've fought well.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.970
It's all thanks to you 
that we've come this far.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:56.720
I'm making the choice.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.410
Give up on your dream and die.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.180
Lead the recruits straight into hell.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.040
I will take down the Beast Titan.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.750
Charge!

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.210
Well, I figured they wouldn't
lie down and die, but...

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.680
A suicide charge?

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.340
Here I was thinking they
could do better than that...

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.360
Now! Fire!

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:55.940
Smoke?

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.240
Oh, it's those signal things...

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.620
Tsk! It's coming, move!

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.140
I'm announcing our final operation!

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.870
All troops, line up!

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.160
We will be doing a cavalry charge.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.100
Our goal: To rush the Beast Titan.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.680
Of course, we'll be making
ourselves ideal targets.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.470
So we'll wait until he's ready to throw
and fire our smoke signals together.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.990
That should reduce his accuracy somewhat.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.680
While we're acting as a decoy,
Captain Levi will kill the Beast Titan.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.820
That is our plan.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.450
What?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.780
You want me to go after him
with just ODM gear?

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.440
He's standing in an empty area.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.130
There's not even a house or tree in sight.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.620
Wrong...

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.880
There happens to be a line of
objects at just the right height.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.590
Sneak close using the Titans...

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.620
...and assassinate the Beast Titan.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.360
I'm sorry...

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.170
Standing and waiting just means
we'll be showered by more boulders.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.450
Get ready on the double!

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.020
Are we all... heading...

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.250
...to our deaths?

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.400
Yes.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.150
If we're gonna die anyways,
you're saying it's better...

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.460
...if we die fighting?

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.110
Yes.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.890
Wait... If we're gonna die anyways,

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.550
no matter how we die,
even if it's disobeying orders,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.720
it all means nothing, right?

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.690
You're precisely right.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.900
It's all meaningless.

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.450
No matter what dreams or hopes you had...

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.730
No matter how blessed a life you've lived...

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.100
It's all the same if 
you're shredded by rocks.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.380
Everyone will die someday.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.270
Does that mean life is meaningless?

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.440
Was there even any meaning in our being born?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.990
Would you say that of our fallen comrades?

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.940
Their lives...

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.210
Were they meaningless?

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.230
No, they weren't!

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.560
It's us who gives meaning
to our comrade's lives!

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.060
The brave fallen! The anguished fallen!

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.310
The ones who will remember
them... are us, the living!

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:43.250
We die trusting the living who follow
to find meaning in our lives!

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:49.110
That is the sole method in which we
can rebel against this cruel world!

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.830
My soldiers, rage!

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.330
My soldiers, scream!

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.370
My soldiers, fight!

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.150
For friends who gave up their hearts...

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:45.230
For friends who gave up their dreams...

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.460
Until everything burns out,
they will continue running...

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.190
...inside the chaos and panic.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.360
Next episode: "Hero."

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.540
"Hero"
