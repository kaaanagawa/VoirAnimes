00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.490
The soldiers had their lives squeezed
out of them like fruit being juiced...

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.760
...and their scraps cast into the sea.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.130
I suppose I should explain what the sea is.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
The sea is a body of salt water that
covers 70% of our world's surface.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.980
"Attack Titan"

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.330
Owl... Who are you?

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.500
I am Eren Kruger.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.420
As you just saw, I possess
one of the Nine Titans.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.190
In other words, I'm a Subject
of Ymir, just like you.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.430
You pretended to be a Marleyan
and infiltrated Public Security?

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.430
What about the blood tests?!

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.690
That was easy enough with 
the help of a doctor.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.290
Doctors make good spies.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.190
In all honesty, you did very well.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.970
But in terms of results, Grice had
every right to grieve like he did.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.620
You're absolutely right...

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.350
I was a useless father, a useless
husband, and a useless man.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.940
And yet, why am I the only one
who remains as a human?

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.000
Dina was someone special,
being a Subject of Ymir with royal blood.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.540
She can tap into a Titan's true power.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.640
If you hadn't jumped to keep
me quiet, Dina would--

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940
Answer me! Why did you let only me live?!

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.360
Enough. Don't your fingers hurt?

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.200
Thanks so much for your concern!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.570
You didn't seem to care so much
when you were chopping them off!

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.370
Well?! If you had gone on a rampage
as your Titan sooner,

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.790
wouldn't the others not be Titans right now?!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.020
What was the whole point of
letting them become Titans?!

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.680
What's wrong? You look pale...

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.680
It wasn't just fellow patriots...

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.850
I've severed thousands of fingers
from Subjects of Ymir...

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.160
...and made them into Titans.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.190
Women and children, too...

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.190
All while believing it was 
for the sake of Eldia.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.380
I don't have much time, Grisha.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.060
I'm entrusting you with the final task.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.120
Not anyone else. Just you.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.820
That day... The day I first met you,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.300
if none of that had happened,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.290
you wouldn't have festered enough
hatred of Marley to come this far.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.560
Is that... the reason you chose me?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.060
That's part of it.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.710
The country... Your father... Yourself...

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.330
The hate in your eyes was enough
to burn the world to ashes.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.560
I was once like that, too...

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.620
The royal family that stayed
behind formed a revolution.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.770
My father was part of it.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.220
However, they accomplished nothing at all...

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.590
...and were burned alive.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.640
I was so young, all I could do was peek
through the closet door and watch.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.650
Ever since then, I've sworn revenge
on Marley and the revival of Eldia.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.650
But all I've managed to do is cut
the fingers off my fellow patriots,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.980
kick them off this wall,
and turn them into Titans.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.590
It's because of the things I've done
that my true identity was never discovered.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.830
I'm no different than when I was little.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.820
Perhaps I'm still looking at the world
through a crack from the closet.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.020
Tell me, Owl.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.470
What is this task left for me?

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.480
It's to infiltrate the walls and
retake the Founding Titan.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.480
After you inherit my Titan, that is.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.620
What did you say?

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.070
That would mean... you...

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.280
I'll be eaten by you as a Titan.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.310
You'll take the Founding Titan
from its owner the same way.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.450
Why aren't you doing it?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.580
Those who inherit the power of
the Nine Titans perish in 13 years.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.450
I inherited this power 13 years ago.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.260
The Owl called it "The Curse of Ymir."

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.010
The founder Ymir lived that long
after her powers awakened,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.970
so it's only appropriate 
we live that long, too.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.940
I've got 13 years left...

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:02.590
And you...

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.900
Eight years left... Not even.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.730
You're wrong.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.680
This has to be... a mistake.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.530
It's wrong.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.630
If one possessing the power of the
Nine Titans dies without passing it on,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.200
the power is inherited by a baby
yet to be born by a Subject of Ymir.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:39.140
It's as if all the Subjects of Ymir are
connected by something we can't see.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.640
One inheritor said they saw paths.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.870
The blood and bones that form a Titan,

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.280
and at times, even memories and
thoughts are sent through those paths.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.240
All the paths cross at a single coordinate.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.000
In other words, that's...

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.340
...the Founding Titan.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.020
Every single Subject of Ymir
is connected to that coordinate.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.670
Who was the founder Ymir exactly?

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.620
Under Marley authority,
she's a pawn of the devil.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.850
During the Eldian Empire era,
she was a miracle of God.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.350
Some say she touched the
source of all living matter.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.310
Who's to say they're wrong?

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:26.860
Huh?

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.700
The only truth in this world
is that there is no truth.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.150
Anyone can become a god or a devil.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.850
All it takes is for people to believe it.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.660
You're the one who said that
Dina had royal blood in her.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.460
Was that a "truth" of yours?

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:49.840
Unfortunately, Dina having
royal blood was true.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.300
Then why abandon her?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.800
Precisely because she had royal blood.
I couldn't let the enemy have her.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.050
It had to be done before Zeke
told Marley everything.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.060
Even so...

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.250
Even so?

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.290
Would she be better off giving birth to
children for the enemy her entire life?

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.450
I've done my duty. You do yours.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.090
Only someone with the power of the
Titans is capable of reaching the walls.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.960
To be perfectly honest,
I don't think I'm fit for the job.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.480
You will do it.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.460
Look at that...

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.960
He was eaten alive by a Titan.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.290
And you asked if watching
that was interesting?

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.350
It wasn't interesting at all.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.590
His screams of agony were unbearable to hear.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.440
I... didn't know any better.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.750
If I had known this was the price
of freedom, I wouldn't have paid it.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.950
Stand.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.680
Fight!

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.980
For the sake of restoring
freedom and dignity to Eldia...

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.260
Stand!

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.250
I...

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.210
...can't.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.160
Look. I brought this from your home.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:21.720
I can't look.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.310
You can't look. Can't stand. Can't fight.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.730
Have you no balls?

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.080
Did Marley castrate you?

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.860
It's pointless to try and
make me recall my hatred.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.550
All I have left now...

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.570
...are my sins.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.240
That's more than enough.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:49.120
The main reason I picked you was
because you left the walls that day.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.210
That day, if you hadn't taken your
little sister and gone past the walls,

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.590
you would've taken over your father's clinic,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:02.050
your sister may have grown up,
married, and even had children.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.250
But you did go outside the walls.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.780
Ever since the first day I kicked
a patriot off this wall...

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.580
Ever since that day you took
your sister outside the walls...

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.860
We must push forward until
the price of our actions is paid.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.070
Even in death and after death.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.240
This is...

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.830
...a story that you began, is it not?

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.640
There are names given
to each of the Nine Titans.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.310
That includes the Titan you will inherit.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.270
No matter which era this
Titan has found itself in,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.070
it has pushed ever forward,
seeking out freedom.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.540
For the sake of freedom, it fights.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.700
Its name...

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.580
The Attack Titan.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:14.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The Nine Titans"
"The true identity of Intelligent Titans stemming from a power exceeding human comprehension that sleeps in Subjects of Ymir. Said power is inherited along with memories through paths which transcend space and time. The 'Coordinate' where all paths intersect is the Founding Titan."

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.590
What are you doing?

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.300
The Attack Titan.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.420
Didn't you just do that?

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.640
No.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.390
Huh?! He did that, right?
Didn't you two see it just now?

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.520
Yeah, but that was...

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.650
See?! What was that all about, Eren?

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.980
No, it's nothing.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.710
It's the name of your Titan, isn't it?
What were you doing talking to yourself?

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.780
Enough, Hange. He's 15 years old.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.660
Everyone goes through a phase.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.910
Huh? What kind of phase are we talking about?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.920
Hange, I'll explain to you later.
It's not right with him here.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.170
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.050
What the hell did you come for?!

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:01.550
Get out.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.550
I'm supposed to be disciplined
for ten more days.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:06.800
It's over.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.060
Hange just now was punishment enough.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.770
We had a talk with Premier Zachary,
so don't worry about it.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.270
If we jail the heroes who toppled
the Armored and Colossal Titan,

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.820
it kinda sends a bad message, you know?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.400
Plus, you were defying us morons who let
the Beast and Armored Titan get away.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.450
That's not...

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.170
Did you lose some weight?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.960
We had plenty to eat, though.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.460
You seem... good.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.920
I guess...

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.130
Let's go. Get dressed quick.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.180
Where are we going?

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:48.930
To an audience.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.780
Her Majesty has come to Trost.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.950
To my dear Historia...

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.440
As I'm writing this, 
Reiner stands next to me.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.630
It's pretty obvious that he's
sneaking peeks at this love letter.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.870
He can be such a creep.
No wonder he's single.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.210
However, he did promise me
he'd deliver this letter to you.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.790
He says it's payback for
saving them that one time.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.210
I'm sorry about then.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.830
I never imagined I would end up
choosing them over you.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.200
It won't be long till I die.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.850
But I have no regrets.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.380
That's what I'd like to say,
but there is one thing...

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.660
It's that I wasn't able to marry you.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.730
Sincerely, Ymir.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:05.190
All the paths cross at a single coordinate.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.610
In other words, that's...

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.790
...the Founding Titan.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.230
What... was that?

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.190
Something wrong?

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.480
Uh, no...

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.150
Is that all there was?

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.120
Yes.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.970
Of course, I doubt she was able
to write anything beneficial for us.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.560
Was there any secret message
only you would know?

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.910
Like a code?

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.200
I don't know.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.310
But I doubt she would do something like that.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.770
Ymir's such a dummy...

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.880
Such a dummy.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.050
You'd play it off the second
you're embarrassed...

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.930
I just never know with you...

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.400
We're here.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.390
Come in.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.430
Your Majesty.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.940
--Your Majesty.
--Your Majesty.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.300
S-Stop it. It's not an official position yet.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.350
So much has happened, hasn't it?

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.930
But all I did was stare at the
south sky from within the walls.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.670
It's an important duty of yours
just to stay alive.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.930
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.050
I'm glad to see you're all acting like usual.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.750
Well, that's...

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.810
It just hasn't sunk in for us yet.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.060
Shall we get this going?

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.750
<i>The Early Life of Grisha Yeager</i>.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.570
<i>The Extent of Our Knowledge</i>
<i>of Titans and Their History</i>.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.940
<i>Information About the World Beyond the Walls</i>.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.370
The only people who know about
the existence of these books

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.760
are those here in this very room.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.430
These were gained by the
efforts of nine living Scouts...

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.330
...and the 199 others who are not here today.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.590
Today, and in the Queen's presence,
I would like to assess our situation...

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.420
...and establish an agreement
in terms of our course of action.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.100
Scout Regiment Commander Hange Zoë.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.180
Sir.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.270
The Scouts have lost a great
deal, including Erwin Smith.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.110
But in exchange for the 
many heroes that we lost,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.860
we have retaken Wall Maria and
stolen the Colossal Titan's powers.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:40.780
However, humanity that lives within the walls
remains in a precarious situation.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.680
It would be a relief were Titans
the only monsters we had for enemies.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.920
--However, the true identity of
the enemies we've been fighting

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.670
--Then who's the enemy?!

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.960
--are humans. A civilization.
You could even say...

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.800
--Enemy?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.550
--If I said that, the--

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.550
--...the world.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.890
According to these,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.020
we're a special race called Subjects
of Ymir who can turn into Titans.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.430
There's also a belief that we
may rule the world again.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.060
That's why the world wishes to
eradicate us Subjects of Ymir for good.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.710
If the Founding Titan falls into
Marley hands, Eldians are done for.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.130
The King in the walls wouldn't
allow that to happen.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.750
The King in the walls won't fight.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.250
Huh?

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:35.480
"If once again Eldia is driven to sin,
we will perish as it's meant to be.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.570
I have made a vow renouncing war
with the Founding Titan."

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:45.100
He said that to the royal family on the
continent and then closed the walls.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:51.750
Did he not warn that the Titans of
the walls would flatten the earth?

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.110
Those words were meant to deter an attack.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.850
It allowed for a brief time of peace.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.620
The King of the walls stole
his people's memories

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.540
and made them believe humanity
perished beyond the walls.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.750
He surrounded himself with the ignorant
and babbled about paradise.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.540
A King who can't protect 
his people is no King.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.590
You must find that cowardly King
and strip him of the Founding Titan.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.220
That is our mission.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.930
Mr. Jaeger later achieved his mission

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.940
and entrusted the Founding
Titan to his son Eren.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.270
In order to wield the
Founding Titan's full power,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.650
it must be possessed by
someone with royal blood.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.200
However, even if that person
possesses the Founding Titan,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.530
they're enslaved by the King's ideals,

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.910
which only leads them down
the path to humanity's downfall.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.750
That is the vow renouncing war.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:59.380
However, Eren was able to control Pure Titans
in the past to escape a dire situation.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.260
So it may be possible even
without royal blood

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.870
for Eren to wield that power as well.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.720
That's right...

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.950
Just for that split second,
it felt like everything connected.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.400
Why?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.440
Why just then?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.200
My name is Dina Fritz.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.950
I'm a descendant of the royal family.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.370
It can't be!

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.330
You scared me. What was that about?

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.710
U-Uh... I-I...

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.220
Please continue, our Titan.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.640
It's... nothing.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.410
Huh?

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.730
Sorry for interrupting the meeting.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.610
Oh? I see... Right...

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.120
It would seem that he is
having a phase of sorts.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.410
One where he acts up
and randomly yells things.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.810
Ah, I see. That's unfortunate.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.670
He's that age, I guess.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:18.970
Eren?

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.670
I haven't told those two about it, either...

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.390
That the Titan who killed my mom and Hannes

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.360
was actually someone my dad
was married to before.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.300
What's more, if I talk about it...

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.730
If someone with royal blood
is made into a Titan that I touch,

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.460
it might be possible for me to use
the Founding Titan's powers.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.910
That's right... It's just a possibility...

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.910
But if they knew of that possibility,
what would the military do to Historia?

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.460
Have a family.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.920
Huh?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.760
After you enter the walls, build a family.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.940
What are you talking about? I have Dina...

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.480
Won't I forget the things you tell me
just before I become a Titan anyways?

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.120
That's not always the case.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.770
And someone may see it later.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.230
Eh?

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.610
Your wife, your child,
your neighbors if need be...

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.970
Love someone inside the walls.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.450
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.750
The same history... The same
mistakes... Over and over...

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:40.250
To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else,
you must see it through.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Mikasa? Armin? Who is that?

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.590
Who knows? I'm not sure...

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.000
Whose memories are those?

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.620
They believed freedom
would come if they fought.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.190
After viewing the sea on the outside world,

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.070
what runs through their minds now,
knowing the truth of humanity?

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.880
Next episode: "The Other Side of the Wall."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"The Other Side of the Wall"
