00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.270
Wall Maria contained one third
of humanity's remaining territory.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.860
Five years ago,
when humanity lost this territory,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.470
from within the remaining
two walls, they realized:

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.370
"That we... are not meant to continue living."

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.010
After all, humanity cannot defeat the Titans.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm going to drive out...

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.970
...every last one from this world!

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.940
However, one young man gripped
that small blade held in his heart,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.750
and thrust it into a Titan, pounding its
massive head into the ground.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.150
When humanity saw this, what did they think?

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.320
Some were proud.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.870
Some held hope.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.200
Some cried out in anger.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.960
Then, if Wall Maria was retaken,
what would humanity cry out?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.050
Would they finally start believing
that humanity deserves to live?

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.970
Advance!

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.270
That our own fate is something we can decide?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.800
Will it be enough for them to believe?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.370
If only Wall Maria was retaken...

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.960
"The Town Where Everything Began"

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.510
Whoa!

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.220
Hey! You've gotta light up the ground!

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.660
S-Sorry.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.270
We're not at the foot yet? It's almost dawn.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.900
Once we're over this mountain,
Shiganshina's right there.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.780
Sorry you're stuck with my horse.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.740
You're supposed to be saving your energy.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.280
Yeah, I know.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.740
She's right. Rest up, Eren.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.410
Don't say his name, idiot.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.700
Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.690
Assume this place is swarming with enemies.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.290
Titan on the left! Everyone halt!
Light up the area!

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.600
It's all right. He's fast asleep.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.170
This lad must not be one of those
new types that moves at night.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.470
That's too bad. Let him be.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.940
I can't believe we didn't
see it till that close up.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.610
Yeah, I'm with you there.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.660
This moonless night must be protecting us.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.700
Light from the moon is reflected sunlight.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.620
The new type of Titan...

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.430
We think they use that minuscule
amount of reflected light to move.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.380
Using the new moon was the right move.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.630
There's no guarantee we won't
have a repeat of before.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.420
That lad may be one of those
"Moonlight Titans" for all we know.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.270
Hope we capture one someday!

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.250
I'm shaking?

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.750
Why? What am I so scared of?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
Shit...

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.450
If I screw up retaking Wall Maria
because I'm like this, what then?!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.880
How many people will lose hope forever?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.290
There won't be a chance like this ever again!

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.020
Am I not cut out for it after all?

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.140
Someone like me? How can I save humanity?

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.640
Someone like me? How?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.390
Eren...

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.600
What are you shaking for? Are you scared?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.860
Huh?! I'm not scared!

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.280
Huh? You're kidding... Look at your hand.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.280
This is... It's cold!
My hand's damn freezing!

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.650
Really? My whole body's been
shaking this whole time.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.600
See?

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.220
Eren, have you ever been afraid of Titans?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.800
Normally, everyone's terrified of them.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.090
Like me... The first time I faced a Titan,
I couldn't move a muscle.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.420
But... there I was...

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.390
And you pulled me right out of a Titan's mouth.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.760
How were you able to do something like that?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.260
I remembered...

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.530
...the time you showed me that book.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.910
Up until then, I never once thought
about what was outside the walls.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.740
I just spent every day
staring at the clouds and sky.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.060
But then, I heard your story
and looked into your eyes.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.440
You were seeing an awesome dream.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.470
But I had nothing.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.730
That's when I knew.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.150
I wasn't free.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.900
Trapped in a small cage in a huge world,
my freedom stolen by those unthinkable fiends.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.960
When I realized that, I couldn't forgive them.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.800
I don't know why, but when it
comes to taking back freedom...

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.220
Yes... Strength flows through me.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.460
Thanks for that.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.260
I'm good now.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.920
Mmm.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.260
I bet, by this time next year,
we'll be looking at the sea.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.940
I recognize this area.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.030
I think... we came here for firewood.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.700
I can see the foot!

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.620
There's signs of a trail!

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.250
It's so close.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.290
I can hear the river.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.590
Finally, we're back...

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.760
The first time... since we fled from here.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.430
Back to our hometown...

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.950
Be on guard for Titans hiding in the shadows!

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.330
Our operation begins now!

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.660
All troops, switch to ODM gear!

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.340
There's two gates we must seal--
the inner and outer.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.640
With that, Shiganshina will be isolated.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.180
We'll exterminate any Titans left inside.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.180
If the enemy knows our plan,
they'll go straight after Eren, but...

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:14.490
We'll have hoods covering the faces
of all 100 of our soldiers.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.410
By the time they find out who Eren is,
we'll have the outer gate plugged.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.920
Don't stop!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.380
Head for the outer gate!

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.510
Roger!

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.140
This is...

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.060
...the remains of a fire?

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.150
They're here... and close!

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.110
Bertholdt and Reiner!

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.290
My house is right around there.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.250
That's where... we left everything behind.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.550
It's okay, I'll take it all back!

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.230
This is all too strange...

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.190
Not a single Titan in sight?

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.020
But we have to keep going.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.610
Yeah, there's no reason to call it off.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.870
I can do this! No...

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.660
We can do this!

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.290
Because we've all been special
since the day we were born!

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.510
We're free!

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.990
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Glowing Ore"
"Ore harvested from the Reiss family's underground cavern. Thought to be produced by some sort of Titan power. It emits more light than a torch, and with appropriate manufacturing, can greatly extend nighttime operations."

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.930
Don't let your guard down!

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.270
Keep on the lookout!

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.480
Roger!

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:55.730
Eren!

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.980
How's your ODM gear?

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.490
It's fine.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.610
But I did manage to lose my cloak.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.160
Thanks.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.870
Mmm.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.040
The hole?!

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.500
Success!

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.540
It's plugged all right!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.220
We did it!

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.640
Eren, you okay?

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.140
No problems here.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:27.930
I'm ready like we trained.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.770
We'll head for the inner gate!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.390
While we're on the move,
remember to hide your faces!

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.400
I really plugged the hole? And that easily...?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.030
You did it.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.110
Believe in your own power.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.990
The hole from then...

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.370
Not yet!

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:58.130
No matter how much you plug it,
they'll break the wall as long as they live.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.760
Until we kill Reiner, Bertholdt,
and any other enemies,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.680
the operation to retake Wall Maria won't end.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.260
Of course... I know that!

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.140
The outer gate was a success.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.640
Still, it's odd...

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.810
There's no attack coming.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.860
On the contrary, we've not seen
a single Titan so far.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.450
Were they not prepared for our sudden assault?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.280
We can only hope, but...

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.830
Considering what Arlelt discovered...

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.700
Hmm?

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.290
I looked into it.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.710
I'm pretty sure someone was camping.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.880
The pot was cold and lights
were scattered on the ground.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.710
They were drinking something like black tea.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.010
Smells good... What is this drink?

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.470
Also, there were three cups
with drops of a black liquid in it.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.520
At the least, there were
three people atop the wall.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.850
Th-Three, you say?!

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.270
Was the metal pot completely cool?

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.190
Yes.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.530
I find that odd.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.440
Agreed.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.240
Th-The pot?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.790
We charged here at full speed
using horses and ODM gear.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.120
Had they noticed our approach
by sound or by sight,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.790
they'd have two minutes to react.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.050
A pot in use wouldn't cool in just two minutes.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:28.340
They had to have known we were
coming for five minutes or more.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.970
Meaning they've had plenty
of time to prepare for us.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.180
But... how?

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.020
Th-There must be a scout in addition
to the three on the wall...

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.900
No, we have to assume there's
many more enemies in hiding.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.110
For now, locating the enemy is our priority.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.400
Arlelt...

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.950
With that brain of yours, you've saved
us from disaster countless times.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.250
Right now is one of those times we need you.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.120
Huh?

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.210
Take as many soldiers as needed.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.500
Find out if enemies are hiding
near the inner gate or not.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.300
As of now, you obey Armin Arlelt's commands.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.300
Continue the search!

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:16.720
R...

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.890
Roger!

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.980
We searched the wall thoroughly!

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.270
What are your orders, Arlelt?!

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.570
Send one group to each side of the wall!

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.190
Search all the buildings near the inner gate!

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.910
Report any findings with an acoustic shell!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.490
A-All right?

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.750
Roger!

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.630
Another big gamble of yours?

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.670
No, he's proven himself.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.920
He's one of our greatest weapons.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.630
Eren's coming to plug the inner gate.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.050
What now?

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:57.010
Pause the operation until we find the enemy?

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:00.980
We continue.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.360
We'll lose a prolonged battle
in enemy territory.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.730
For us, our only chance
is with a decisive battle.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:14.990
Besides, if this is all according to the
enemy's plan, we'll just have to live with it.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.790
In any case, they're not the
only ones hiding something.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.590
What do I do?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.010
Eren's coming to seal the inner gate...

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.680
And we don't know where the enemy's at!

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.810
Why haven't they shown
even though we plugged the wall?

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.640
Why can't we find them
no matter how much we search?

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.060
This is bad... What now?

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.730
If we fail... that'll really be the end!

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.610
It's over. Everything...

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.200
They always attack us in unthinkable
ways we always fail to predict.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.580
We're always at a disadvantage because...

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.870
...we simply know nothing about Titans!

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.500
Always...?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.430
Did you find them, Arlelt?!

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.390
Where are they?!

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.350
Not yet! Everyone search the walls!

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.270
I told you we already did!

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.900
There's nowhere to hide!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.650
Inside the walls!

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.150
Inside the walls?

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.320
Yes!

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.410
There must be a spot where someone
could stay inside for a long time!

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.330
How do you know that?!

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.290
It's a hunch.

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.590
Do you have any idea what
sort of situation we're in?!

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.010
We don't have time to waste on hunches!

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.670
Think about it!

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.350
The enemy always attacks us using
Titan powers in ways we never imagine!

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.430
If we constrain ourselves to
common sense and reason,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.430
we'll never be able to gain the upper hand!

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.150
The signal to halt the mission!

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:19.030
All troops, scatter and stand by atop the wall!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.490
Roger!

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.750
There are times to be strict
and times to be flexible.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.000
Adhere to the principles you vowed
while giving everything you've got.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.210
Obey the chain of command.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.260
The reason we are here is to claim victory!

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.680
Break into two groups again
and search the surface!

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.640
Especially above the gate!

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.470
Commence the search!

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.390
Rog...

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.770
Roger!

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.150
What are they doing?

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.110
Should we really be waiting like this?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.950
Yeah, so much for our surprise attack...

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.370
Armin... Did you figure something out?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.050
A position to react, no matter
when Eren appears...

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.100
A position able to see everything...

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.390
If there is such a place,
it has to be in the walls.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:32.770
If the enemy has no idea we know
about the Titans in the walls,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.070
and they think we'll never see it coming...

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.400
Or possibly...?

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.040
Here! There's a cavity here!

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.380
Reiner!

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.400
Shit!

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.030
--Captain?!

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.690
--Is that another Titan power?!
--Captain?!

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.860
--Is that another Titan power?!

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.370
So close! But I couldn't finish 'em!

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.340
Keep on the lookout!

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.260
Locate his allies!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.800
Boulder incoming!

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.760
Get down!

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.390
What the--?!

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.020
Did he miss?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.900
No... That was good aim.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:43.070
He plugged the entrance.
Now the horses can't pass.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.490
They'll aim for the horses and surround us...

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:50.080
...in order to block our escape
and annihilate us here.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:52.950
We're both hoping for the same thing.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.040
To settle it here once and for all.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.210
Humanity or Titans?!

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.420
Which side will live?! Which side will perish?!

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.650
A horde of Titans appears out of nowhere.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.940
As they vie to settle the fight,

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:53.370
the once friend becomes enemy
and stands in Eren's way.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.590
Next episode: "Thunder Spears."

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.590
