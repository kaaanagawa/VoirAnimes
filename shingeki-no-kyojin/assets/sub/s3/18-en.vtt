WEBVTT

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.340
I should've known... this would happen.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.960
But... I had no other 
choice but to rely on you.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.020
Armin...

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.730
Why... don't you run away?

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.400
A Titan?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.320
Shit!

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.740
You just try coming closer!

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.240
Make one move to take him and he's dead!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.040
What's that?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.710
He's got... Titan marks around his eyes.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.610
Is he the Beast Titan?!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.060
Are you...

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.470
...Eren Jaeger?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.310
If nothing else, I'm taking him with me!

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.890
You look nothing like your father.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.090
What?

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.410
Believe me, I know what you're going through.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.180
We're both victims of your father.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.100
You've... been brainwashed by him.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.940
My... dad?

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.050
Argh... You're kidding me!

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.910
He chased me all the way here?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.100
Let's call it a draw, Levi.
We're in no shape to fight.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.620
Bertholdt...

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.230
I'm sorry, but I think it's the end for you.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.820
Eren! Someday, I'm coming back to rescue you!

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.280
He ran?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.170
Captain!

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.500
That was the last of my gas.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.420
I'll chase him! Hand over 
your gas and blades!

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.340
Right!

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.130
Hurry!

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.020
"Midnight Sun"

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.400
Reiner... What's this metal case
you had in your left chest pocket?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.910
Before we chopped off all your limbs,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.710
you tried to grab it with
the strength you had left.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.290
Suicide pills? Or perhaps a bomb?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.150
Ouch!

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.290
Sorry.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.000
A letter...

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.240
A letter?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.510
What kind of letter?

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.250
A letter... from Ymir.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.930
You have to... give it... to Christa...

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.430
Only after we've inspected it.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.990
Now then. I've got a mountain
of questions for you, but...

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.650
Your lips seem as tight 
as your armor is hard.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.920
Are you going to cooperate and tell us
everything that we want to know?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.630
No.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.500
Thanks. It helps that 
you're prepared for this.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.420
Hold on!

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.850
Are you sure? We might be able
to steal his power.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.460
Today, I would like to explain...

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.750
...how we're going to get
maximum value from this injection.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.970
Using this medicine, the Colossal
Titan's, the Armored Titan's,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.270
or the Beast Titan's powers can be stolen.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.330
As for how...

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.610
The one injected with 
this will become a Titan,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.050
and eat someone who can change
into a Titan like Eren can.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.280
By doing so, although they would
initially be a Titan lacking intelligence,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.830
they would revert into a human
able to wield that Titan's powers.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.390
If this is achieved, not only do we gain
information regarding Titan powers,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.740
we're also able to revive a person
on the brink of death.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.440
If you capture an enemy with
Titan powers, sever all their limbs.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.730
And when it is safe to do so,
summon Captain Levi.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.660
We have only this one injection.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.650
I'm entrusting Captain Levi
with the call to use it.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.050
I don't think all the conditions
for that have been met.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.920
We don't know the situation
with Levi and the other side.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.930
Neither do we have the time
to go confirm it ourselves.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.430
Reason being, there's no way for us
to gauge the full depth of their powers!

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.390
Even if I cut his head off,
we can't be too sure!

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.980
This isn't like you, Hange.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.990
If we back down because
of not knowing something,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.200
down the line, can we ever
hope to beat the Titans?

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.300
Jean...

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.110
When are we ever going to know
all there is about the enemy?

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.800
Mikasa.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.180
Yeah?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.800
How much gas do you have?

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.310
It's almost entirely gone.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.560
But it should be enough to reach
Eren and Armin at least.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.090
That's more than me.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.900
Mikasa... I need you to go
check out their situation.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.410
Fill up your gas and bring back
the injection from Levi.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.370
If for any reason you're unable
to do so, fire a smoke signal.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.030
That will be my signal to end Reiner.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.000
Affirmative.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.900
Hange, I--

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.370
The decision was mine.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.760
You were just a factor.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.670
Why... did I?

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.320
After all this time, am I actually...?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.280
Yeah! Keep it up!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.630
Armin's breathing again!

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.450
Come on! Just keep on breathing!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.410
Armin?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.080
Captain! Get the syringe!

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.720
Make Armin into a Titan and
we'll have him eat Bertholdt!

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.180
Hurry up and inject him!

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.640
Yeah...

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.730
Hange!

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.990
Not good!

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.460
Reiner was taken! Hange!

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.920
Shit!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.840
Conny! Don't chase!

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.700
We hardly have any gas left.
You'll just end up getting killed.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.000
Shit!

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.840
It's my fault...

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.780
I've... done something terrible...

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.980
I said the decision was mine.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.740
Let's regroup with the others.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.880
Captain... Levi...

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.340
I finally found you.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.170
Commander Erwin is badly wounded!

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.800
His stomach is gouged...
and his organs are demolished!

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.680
The blood just won't stop!

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.270
I thought that injection
might be able to help, but...

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.480
What do you think?

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.360
Huh?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.160
Captain?

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.250
He's... still breathing.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.340
He's... alive.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.520
I'm using the injection... on Erwin.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.800
You said...

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.280
...you'd use it on Armin!

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.790
I'm... reviving the one 
who can save humanity.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.410
Reiner... You were incredibly lucky.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:29.020
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Injection Conditions"
"Not only can Titan powers and much-needed information be stolen by using the injection, but it also allows the revival of someone who is critically wounded. The ideal candidate would be someone near death that is already close to an incapacitated enemy with Titan powers."

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.450
You guys...

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.260
Do you have the faintest damn clue...

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.340
...what you're doing?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.070
It's Erwin...

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.580
The Commander of the Scouts.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.700
And you're saying to watch him die.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.000
There's no time for this.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.890
Stay out of my way.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.800
Keep your emotions out of this.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.390
Keep my... emotions out?

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.930
Tell me... How come you didn't
hand over the syringe right away?!

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.730
Because I was considering the
possibility Erwin might still be alive.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.730
You couldn't have known Floch
would drag the commander here!

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.490
There's just no way you knew!

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.280
You're right, but...

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.330
The fact that Erwin is now here
means I use it on him.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.010
Hey!

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.680
His strength isn't all there!

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.600
I can take it from him by force!

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.140
You should know as well as I do!

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.310
Without Erwin's talent,
humanity can't beat the Titans!

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.270
That's right, Mikasa! Let's stop
with this madness already!

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.530
It's... no different if we lose... Armin.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:05.740
Eren!

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.040
Hasn't it... always been like that?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.670
He's the reason why we saved
Trost by plugging it with a rock.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.380
He revealed Annie's identity.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.670
It was Armin who came up with
the idea of moving at night!

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.430
The only reason we uncovered
Reiner's hiding spot...

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.350
...and the only reason 
we defeated Bertholdt...

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.930
...was all because of Armin!

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.010
The one who's gonna save humanity
isn't me or the commander!

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.310
It's Armin!

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.820
Isn't that right, Mikasa?!

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.070
Please give it to me!

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.910
The one who will save humanity...
is Commander Erwin.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.910
Shut up!

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.420
I will not shut up.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.670
Don't think you're the only
ones who had it tough!

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.420
You might not know, but...

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.800
On the other side of that wall,
there's not a single living soldier.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.690
Everyone died when the Beast
Titan threw boulders at us.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.080
I didn't think anyone could be saved...

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.900
But Commander Erwin was the only exception.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.200
He thought of a plan for us
to bite back at the Beast Titan...

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:22.650
...and we did.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.730
We were smashed to bits just as planned.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.160
And I'm sure the last thing they felt...

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.750
...was fear.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.050
When I found the commander alive,
I was about to finish him off.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.390
But... that's going too easy on him.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.400
I thought to myself that he ought
to taste more of this hell.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.730
And then... I understood.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.240
The only one who can lay waste
to the Titans... is a devil!

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.080
And if I can bring back the devil,
that must be my mission in life!

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.340
That has to be why I survived like
a coward when everyone else died!

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.710
So stay out of his way!

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.840
Don't do it!

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.800
Hange...

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.690
Hey... You've got to be... kidding me...

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.060
No way...

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.830
You can't... be serious...

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:58.660
Mikasa! You have to know
how much we need Erwin!

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.040
We can't let the flames of hope
extinguish inside the walls!

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.710
But... Armin could... do that, too!

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.150
It's true, Armin is exceptional...

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.220
But he doesn't have Erwin's
experience and leadership!

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.330
There are people I want to bring back, too.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.320
Hundreds of them.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.740
I've had to say farewell since
the day I joined the Scouts.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.780
Hange!

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.880
But...

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.340
You know, don't you?

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.010
No matter who it is,
there comes a day to say farewell.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.690
I know it's impossible,
but you have to accept this.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.600
There will be times you 
can't keep your sanity.

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.480
It's tough.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.360
Very tough.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.920
I know.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.690
Even so, we have to keep moving forward.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.500
Captain...

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.070
Do you... know about... the sea?

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.210
No matter how far you look,
it stretches past the horizon.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.200
It's a gigantic lake.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:00.700
Armin said--

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.000
Hey! Cut it out!

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.330
There's a sea beyond the walls...

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.840
...and he said we'd go there together!

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.840
But... that was our dream since we
were little, and I forgot it long ago!

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.500
Avenging my mom... Killing the Titans...

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.850
The only thoughts in my 
head are full of hate!

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.360
But... he's not like that!

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.400
Armin cares about more than just fighting!

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.060
He has dreams!

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.820
Everyone get out of here!

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.830
I'm going to have Erwin eat Bertholdt!

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:46.870
Come on. Let's go, Mikasa.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.190
Shit... Shit...!

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.380
Armin...

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.500
See you...

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.810
Let's start by seeing the sea!

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.960
You'll see! It does exist!

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.780
If this dream of yours comes true...

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.370
...what will you do then?

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.240
I don't know. I won't know until it happens.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.620
I...

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.600
I want to go to the basement.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.640
Good grief.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.420
They're all the same...

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.840
Whining like brats one after another...

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:47.100
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.110
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.910
But there's more than that.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.710
The sea...

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.000
Erwin!

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.590
Teacher...

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.340
How do we know there's not more humans...

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.430
...outside the walls?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.850
Give up on your dream and die.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.740
Lead the recruits straight into hell.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.300
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.570
I will take down the Beast Titan.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.440
Levi...

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.260
Thank you.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.660
Guys!

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.370
Help me!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.690
Annie! Reiner!

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:46.410
Captain...

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.260
Why... did you...?

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.110
Do you think... you can forgive him?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.760
He had no choice but to become a devil.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.820
It was us who wished for that.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.920
And in the end, when he had
finally been set free from hell,

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.870
we wanted to bring him back once more.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.100
But I think... it's time to let him rest.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:31.270
Erwin...

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.390
I promised I'd kill the Beast Titan, but...

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.960
It's going to have to wait.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:40.400
He's... dead.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.030
I see.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.450
Armin is shaken after learning
of Bertholdt's and Erwin's deaths.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.630
Eren heads towards that place his father,
Grisha, promised to show him.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.160
Next episode: "The Basement."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.540
"The Basement"
