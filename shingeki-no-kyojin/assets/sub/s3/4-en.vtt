WEBVTT

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey, don't you think we're a bit far out?

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
No point in searching 
if we're not spread out.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.690
Why did I get stuck with you?

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.030
Wait, Marlo... You just wanted
alone time with me, didn't you?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.370
Hitch... I'm sorry, but you're
not my first choice either.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.620
Oh, is that right? Well, good for you.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.290
But, don't you think it's odd?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.340
Why would the Scouts kill
a civilian and run for the hills?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.180
They're the same group that's always
risking their lives for the sake of humanity.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.640
I can't believe you... Did you forget?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.470
Remember what they did to Stohess District?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.350
How they turned it into a battlefield?

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.610
All those corpses we had to carry?

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.230
And how Annie's still missing?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.120
All of her junk is still in
my room... and it's annoying.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.160
But they also uncovered that Titan in hiding
and somehow managed to capture it.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.750
You think any other regiment could do that?

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.460
If the Scouts get disbanded
like this, humanity can't...

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.630
Quiet.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.470
I hear water.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.720
Don't move!

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.390
Slowly turn this way.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.690
You must be a scout.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.650
Just like that... Not a word.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.360
Now listen to me and do as I--

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.790
That's right... Hand over your
guns to the one in front.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.000
And not a word, right?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.970
"Trust"

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.640
"Capital Mitras"

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.450
Sorry to keep you waiting, Erwin.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.080
I know it's sudden, but let's get
the interrogation over with.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.710
So, it's unmistakable that the Scout
Regiment murdered a civilian?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.000
Judging by the evidence, at least.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.340
Having said that, we can't say
for sure at the time being.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.760
Are you saying the Interior Police are
responsible for issuing the search--?

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.810
Hey, Peaure!

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.390
Sorry about him, Commander Dawk.
He's still a rookie, through and through.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.730
He doesn't know how we
do things within the walls.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.900
Don't you worry about the Interior Police.
We won't write anything about 'em.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.070
That goes for their new ODM gear, too.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.280
I appreciate it, Roy.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.490
Their new ODM gear...

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.250
That buckshot is useless against Titans,
but it's perfect for killing people.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.840
It's a weapon practically made
for killing the Scouts...

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.920
Plus, its existence being hidden
even from us means...

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.050
...sooner or later, we might find ourselves
staring down their muzzles all the same.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.850
Anyways, we should hear a report
from them soon, so be patient.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.520
Wait up, you fat-ass!

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.910
You idiot! That way's a dead end!

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.240
Shit!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.050
Shit, he's gone!

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.220
Find him! Find him!

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.720
Don't let 'em escape!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.980
You're the son of Boss Reeves, right?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.310
What's your name?

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.650
Flegel.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.440
Nice to meet you, Flegel.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.360
I'm Hange Zoë.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.780
The thing is, if the Military 
Police is after you,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.450
that must mean you know the truth
about your father's death, right?

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.790
Can you tell me what happened?

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.630
While I was busy taking a piss,
the Interior Police got my old man.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.090
A tall guy wearing a black coat...
he killed my father.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.800
In any case, it's great 
that you're still alive.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800
Now we can make the truth public.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.350
How's that?! Haven't you seen the paper?!

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.520
If the Military Police say the
Scouts did it, that's the truth!

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.270
My testimony means jack shit!

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.190
They know I was there... The Interior
Police found out I saw everything...

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.150
Now there's nowhere safe for me to go.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.950
All I can do is run and hide
in these cramped walls...

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.080
My life is... shit!

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.580
Well, you have a point...

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.380
The thing is, that doesn't
sound like living to me.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.300
Look at it this way, Flegel.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.470
Instead of scampering around like
a scared little mouse your whole life,

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.220
wouldn't you rather face up to your enemy,
even if it means risking your life--?

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.270
Like hell I would!

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.890
Not everyone has the same disregard
for their lives as you do!

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.480
Not only that, but you have
no right to criticize me either!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.030
Don't you care about telling your
company and family the truth?!

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.280
Huh?! That's just what's best for you!

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.070
Of course it is!

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.660
You oughta start thinking
what's best for you, too!

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.490
Who's that?! Who's making
a scene on my roof?!

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.870
Now then, you're coming with me, Flegel.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.420
Hell no! Your gang already lost!

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.500
You've been defeated!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.210
What are you talking about?

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.760
Defeat is all the Scout
Regiment has ever known!

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.930
Disguise as Military Police
to get by the guards...

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.720
Then figure out where Eren
was taken by snooping around.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.890
To think we'd have no better option...

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.860
We just don't have time...
We've got no choice but to do or die.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.980
Captain.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.990
Now then...

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.700
Stohess District Military Police.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.410
Private Marlo Freudenberg.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.240
Captain Levi! It's really him!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.580
Same assignment, Private Hitch Dreyse.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.670
As for how we'll dispose of you...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.420
Because of you guys, over 100 people
from Stohess District were killed!

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.550
Huh?

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.380
Hey!

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.890
You people... You might think
that you're all heroes of justice,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.100
but the victims and their families
were dropped straight into hell!

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.310
Yeah, I know.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.280
You there... You're from the
Southern Cadet Corps, yeah?

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.820
Just like Annie Leonhart.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.530
Were you friends of hers?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:41.500
No... I doubt she had any friends.
Being as gloomy and aloof as she was.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.120
It's like she was a kid 
afraid of other people...

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.550
I never got the chance to
know anything about her.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.670
And the reason they still 
haven't found her...

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.510
...is because she was pulverized
by a Titan into a puddle of jelly!

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:57.970
No...

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:02.850
Because the Titan in hiding was...
Annie Leonhart herself.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.350
Goddammit, it makes me sick.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.320
Nobody knows a damn thing about
this world... Not us or anyone else.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.490
Except for those bastards
at the center of it all.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.700
We'll release you both
as soon as we get out of here.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.330
Annie was...

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.080
Captain Levi! Please let me help you!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.300
I don't think what you 
guys are doing is wrong!

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.970
If I can help correct this world's injustice,
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.300
What's with this guy?

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.520
I beg of you, Captain Levi!

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.770
Not a chance.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.520
I can't tell how prepared you are about
making an enemy of the government.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.940
Let's go.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.940
Sasha. Tie them up somewhere nearby.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:54.940
Yes, sir!

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.370
Captain.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.580
Please let me do it.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.920
Knock yourself out.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.220
Stop.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.310
We'll forget what we saw here.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.140
Yeah, you will! Because both
of you will die here!

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.440
That's not what he said!

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.190
Letting you two run free is too dangerous.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.690
I'll take it upon myself to kill you!

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.280
Please, believe us!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.990
We know you guys are fighting
to try and save humanity!

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.950
Right, Hitch?!

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.780
Mmm, mmm!

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.580
As if I could trust you.
Especially you, Mr. Bowl Cut.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.500
Who in their right mind
would cut their hair like that?

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.420
You'll get no sympathy from this guy!

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.420
Hitch, run!

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.260
My gun is faster, you know.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.390
Wanna take your chances?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.520
Your knife and my gun... Let's race!

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.100
Wait! I'm really your ally!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.310
Why the hell would anyone
believe you'd wanna join us?

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:18.320
We're so severely outmatched,
you really think we can save humanity?

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.110
Then, why are you...?

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.240
Why are you still with the Scouts then?

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.540
I picked the wrong regiment to join.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.880
As long as you guys have it in you
to risk your lives and keep fighting...

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.840
...I will trust you.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.390
Hitch!

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.760
You damn horse face!

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.890
Wait, Hitch! He was just testing us!

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.480
Huh?!

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.150
Hey, you.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.900
What would you have done
if I swung the knife at you?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.450
Why did you trust me so much?

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.530
Somehow or another,
you remind me of a guy that I hate.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.200
A damn idiot.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.580
This idiot... Is it the same
one Annie talked about?

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.960
Hell if I know.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.710
Everyone's an idiot.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.550
Fortunately, we're both just as dumb.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.140
Marlo, I think you proved your dedication.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.150
That should be enough
to convince Captain Levi.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.480
We're counting on you.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.660
That over there is the least
manned checkpoint around.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.660
All right. We'll handle it ourselves.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.700
Get back to your squad 
before it's suspicious.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.910
Yes, sir.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.500
Marlo, Hitch.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.250
We're grateful.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.630
Sir!

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.920
Let's go!

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.140
It's our turn to pick a fight!

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:11.390
Hmm?

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.740
It's me.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.790
Captain, he's...

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.920
With the Interior Police.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.880
I've got a few questions for him.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.380
Let's move.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.010
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Chancellery"
"An institution which unifies and supervises the various public organizations of administration, justice, and military which act under the royal government's will. Although it officially outranks other organizations, its authority is under constant contention."

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:07.660
How dumb can you be?
Running into a deserted dump like this...

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.740
Shit!

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.370
But I owe you one, Flegel Reeves.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.750
When you got away and
gave us the slip, I really...

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.210
I thought I was screwed!

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.930
For a minute there, I thought they'd kill me.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.720
Nice knowing you, Flegel. Thanks a bunch!

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.480
Ah, wait!

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.350
Why was my old man killed?!

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.190
Did the Interior Police do it?!

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.900
Huh? What does it matter to you?

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.400
You're about to be fresh corpse.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.990
I-I wanna know before I die!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.700
What did he ever do to deserve being killed?!

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.950
Eh? You don't know?

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.670
He betrayed us and sided
with those damn Scouts.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.960
Betrayed?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.300
So you're saying it was the Interior Police
that made him kidnap those Scouts?!

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.130
Except it was a different squad than us.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.970
Guess he didn't say a damn thing.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.140
Not to his dimwit son.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.770
And what if he would've refused?

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.940
Well, he'd have known a bit too much,
so he would've had to die.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.900
What a fool.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.610
Look where caring for the city
and workers got 'em.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.610
You would never understand.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.820
Hmm?

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.950
Talking like you're smart shit...

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.580
My old man taught me something.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.040
That merchants gotta follow their nose.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.380
And I'm damn glad that I did.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.420
Because I found the people
who could avenge my old man!

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.920
And I side with them!

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.010
What's the matter, Flegel? Go on and
oink like a pig to be slaughtered!

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.760
You had your time, but it's over!

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.970
Look above you, morons!

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.110
Ouch!

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.660
Section Commander! You're too wild!

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.290
Hell yeah! Did you hear that, everyone?!

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:25.290
The... Scout Regiment...? Why?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.670
Not so deserted, eh?

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.970
Perhaps it looks that way to you.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:34.390
But, sorry.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.510
I know it doesn't look like much,
but we still live here.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.270
We heard everything.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:45.560
The Interior Police and their schemes...
Everyone here is a witness.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.150
S-So, what does it matter?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.190
It's the government that
decides what's the truth!

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.240
You fools... Don't think you can
do this and get away with it!

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.870
You're all in for a world of hu--

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.950
Everyone... Don't worry.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.910
The Reeves Company will protect this city.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.630
As of today, I, Flegel Reeves...

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.380
I'm the boss.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:16.590
So... from now... you can count... on me.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.890
We're counting on you, Boss.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.890
Speak up, man!

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.770
Congrats on the job.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.730
Keep an eye on these Interior Police.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.980
Right.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.530
Stop it...

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.950
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.000
Oh, you're so brave.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.800
That checkpoint back there was just recruits
who could barely wipe their own ass.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.050
You think you're some sort of hero,
beating them down?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.840
What an atrocious thing we've done.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.730
But what's more atrocious
is this mouth of yours.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.060
I recommend you start talking
while you're still able to use it.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.520
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.610
It's no use!

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:23.120
All that's left for you now is to run and hide
inside these walls, covered in mud and shit!

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.210
If you don't turn yourselves in, every last
Scout we captured will get the noose!

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.590
Starting with the one most
guilty of all, Erwin Smith!

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.260
Shut up.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.390
That's for not answering my question.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.720
Some Scouts' lives are
more valuable than others.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.980
Only those dumb enough
to acknowledge that join us.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:50.400
Tell me where Eren and Christa are at.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.150
I-I don't know!

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.190
I'm not allowed to know!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.110
Kenny Ackermann is a very cautious man!

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.200
Ackermann?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.160
I know Kenny... Is that his last name?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.910
It is, but...

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:10.920
True, there's a lot of things he doesn't
divulge... Especially the important stuff.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.290
But you must have a rough idea.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.380
You best try to remember.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.960
--Stop it!

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.630
--You still have plenty of bones left to break.
--Stop it!

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.880
--You still have plenty 
of bones left to break.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.350
You... You're insane!

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.060
Maybe I am.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.850
Someone's coming from that way!

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.810
More than one!

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.690
Told you so, Captain.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.230
It's no use.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.360
One way or another, the Scouts
will soon come to an end!

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.580
I've seen you in better shape.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.420
And to think you were
lecturing me the other day.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.590
You're getting an audience with the King.

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:07.770
They'll decide how to dismantle the Scouts
and announce your final sentence.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.520
Nile, huh?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.770
Where was your house?

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.860
Stohess District, was it?

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.490
Is Marie...? Is your family doing well?

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.540
They're doing fine. Both Marie and the kids.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.460
I haven't been home in a while, but...

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.250
...it's around Eastern Wall Rose.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.090
I see...

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.340
What's with the odd questions?

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.300
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.140
When, and if the time comes...

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.900
When it comes, I will only watch.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.610
It's up to you to decide. You... and them.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.740
So, I take it not much
came out of Erwin in the end.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.460
Indeed... He must not have learned
any secrets from Pastor Nick.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:19.250
Historia Reiss can make all the claims she wants
about her name, but they'll amount to nothing.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.550
How silly.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.800
In any case, they're all nothing
more than birds in a cage.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.970
Just waiting to die...

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.220
Excuse me.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.770
Erwin Smith has arrived.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:36.190
Very well. We're coming.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.280
Once we finally execute him,
all will be according to plan.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.280
And just like they always have,
the wall's secrets will stay safe.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.030
We'll protect the peace within the walls.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.240
Forever...

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.000
Erwin.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.090
Do you have any last words?

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.190
In order to protect the kingdom...

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.860
In order to protect the King,
they kept the truth hidden.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:52.690
However, in doing so, they invite
an uprising of the people.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.540
Next Episode: "Reply."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Reply"
