WEBVTT

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
"Descent"

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.150
Defend him!

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.750
Even if it costs us our lives...

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.210
...we <i>must</i> let Eren reach the gate!

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.030
Do <i>not</i> let the Titans get near him!

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.690
They're going to plug the hole
with that? It's insane...

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.300
Eren might end up getting eaten.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.270
And if that happens,
we still won't know a thing.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.060
Yeah... If it comes to it, I'll have to do
something with my Titan somehow.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.940
But if their plan works, it'll plug
the hole we finally opened.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.650
It doesn't matter.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.320
We've been searching for a clue these
past five years and we finally found it.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200
Hey... you guys?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.990
What... were you just talking about?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.890
What did you mean by "my Titan," Reiner?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.540
What's this about "The hole
we opened," Bertholdt?

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.260
Marco...

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.630
That conversation just now... was a joke.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.560
H-Have you guys lost it? This isn't like you!

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.390
Focus on the mission!

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.920
Look, the Titans are coming! Let's go!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.810
Eren transformed into a Titan...

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.670
Humans can become Titans...

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.150
So if the Colossal Titan appeared out
of nowhere and suddenly vanished...

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.850
...it's probably a human, too.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.160
In other words, the enemy Titans
are hiding as humans somewhere.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.650
That means...

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.560
Reiner!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.230
R-Reiner! What are you doing?!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.000
Reiner?!

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.070
This is a joke, right?!

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.610
No, Marco... The problem
is you're too damn sharp.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.570
Someone help--!

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.080
Annie! Help me out!

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.040
What's this all about?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.040
Reiner's acting crazy! Help me!

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.670
He heard our conversation.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.760
We can't let him live.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.470
You're shitting me... You asshole!

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.730
What?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.570
A Titan! It's coming this way!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.180
Annie! Take off Marco's ODM gear!

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.270
Huh?!

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.220
Do it, fast!

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.430
Why... do I have to?

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.980
Back there, you risked your
life for Conny, didn't you?

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.870
Why did you put yourself in danger?

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.950
Have you become attached to
this evil race or something?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.190
If I'm wrong, prove it to me right now!

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.170
If you, and your father waiting
for you to come home,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.260
are any different than this
filthy race, prove it right now!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.590
Reiner! It's almost on top of us!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.650
Annie!

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.810
Stop it! Annie! Don't do this!

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.020
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why do this?!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.590
Annie!

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.200
This is what makes us warriors.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.290
Annie, you did well.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.700
Reiner. What now?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.320
Not yet. We have to let them gather first.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.150
I see... They were waiting
for all the Titans to gather...

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.590
Wait...

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.580
Why? What are you in such a hurry for?!

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.060
We haven't... even...

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.980
...had a chance to talk this through!

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.250
Hey...

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.500
Why...

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.620
...is Marco...

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.310
...getting eaten?

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.310
I already told you...

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.230
Annie is doing fine, I'm sure.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.940
There's no way she's getting tortured.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.520
For starters, don't you 
think that's unlikely?

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.230
With powers like ours, one scratch and
we can pretty much handle anything.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.700
And remember it's Annie
we're talking about here.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.080
I bet she's in hiding somewhere
practicing her kicks and what not.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.000
Still, there's no mistaking
her identity was revealed.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.430
Even if it's Annie...

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.390
Oh? Does this mean you're
not fully committed yet?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.800
Is that right?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.350
And what about the agreement
we came to? Was that all for nothing?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.060
We can go at it again if you want, Reiner.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.360
But the next time you lose, you give up
your armor to another warrior.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.890
N-No, that's not what I meant.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.340
Then pull yourself together.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.360
We only have one goal.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.620
To recover the Coordinate and
put an end to this cursed history.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.920
Let's... end this.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.420
I want to end all this, with us.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.930
Understood. I'll try to keep
Annie out of my head for now.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.680
There's no need to put anyone
else through this hell but us.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:41.690
Let's...

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.160
...end this.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.320
Bertholdt...

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.120
War Chief Zeke.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.700
Enemy troops are approaching.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.910
They've reached the foot.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.170
My brave warriors.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.080
It's time to settle this here and
finish our mission once and for all.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.110
Hot!

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.730
--Let's go.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.350
--Yeah.
--Let's go.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:30.990
Bertholdt.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.700
I've told you a bunch of times, but...

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.810
You and I will be in separate positions.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.870
So try thinking on your own for once.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.370
R-Right.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.620
You don't always have to wait for my signal.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.710
Yeah, I know.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.800
You're supposed to be the one
with the greatest ability of all,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.950
yet you leave it to others when it matters.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.460
To be honest, I never thought you reliable.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.640
I know.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.740
Up until now.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.270
We're ending this here, right?

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.670
That's right.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.270
We're gonna win and end this.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.150
Keep up that attitude till
you're with your beloved Annie.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.530
I-It's not like that...

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.240
I bet even Annie would appreciate
the one who rushes in to save her...

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.410
...and mistake him for her prince.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.920
Even if it's you.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.720
And... Christa...

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.420
We'll save her no matter what.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.670
That's our promise to Ymir.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.120
Yeah, no matter what.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.350
See ya. I'm counting on you, buddy.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.450
Leave it to me.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.830
It's been a while since Reiner transformed...

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.450
No signal yet?

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.680
Reiner... Are you okay out there?

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.830
We did it!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.290
We blew his head off!

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.460
The Armored Titan bit the dust!

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.010
We did it...

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.380
You were such a pain in the ass for us.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.850
Serves you right, scumbag!

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.060
What the hell are you crying for?!

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.230
C'mon, get up! This ain't over yet!

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.320
Don't cry! We're the ones who killed him!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.710
It's not over! Ready your equipment
for the next round!

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.730
Armin...

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.750
It's not like... we had
any chance to negotiate...

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.590
It's our side dealing with the
overwhelming lack of information.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.930
We don't have the power to capture
someone who can turn into a Titan.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.530
There was... nothing we could do.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.020
It can't be...

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.820
There it was! The signal!

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.110
Nail him with Thunder Spears!
We'll just have to blow his body to bits!

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.120
That scream just now...

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.340
Was it for Bertholdt?

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.780
Wait! We need to get away from Reiner!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.070
Up there! The Colossal Titan is coming!

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.150
We'll all get blown away!

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.950
Where are you, Reiner?! I'm coming!

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.960
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Dark Liquid"
"Believed to be a beverage consumed by the Titan shifters while they were camping out. Confirmed to have a pleasant aroma from the remaining liquid found. Its origin is unknown, but this suggests the existence of an 'outside' culture that consumes luxury goods similar to black tea."

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.050
Tsk!

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.640
They got us...

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.970
Shit! Everyone, get away
from the Armored Titan!

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.930
The Colossal Titan is falling our way!

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.770
Shoot! At this distance...

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.020
...none of us can avoid it.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.060
I'm close to the ground.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.320
It's now or never. I'll blow
this whole place away.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.550
Reiner!

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.010
Reiner?!

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.800
Reiner?

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.660
He's alive!

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.980
But he...

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.270
He transferred his consciousness
throughout his whole nervous system?

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.360
But that was... a last resort.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.050
To think he'd actually do it...

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.550
It's hard to believe they
cornered you like that.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.930
Reiner...

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.990
I need you to do something for me.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.160
You're going to have to move a little.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.260
And if you can't, I'm sorry...

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.690
Prepare for the worst.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.940
I'm ending this.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:07.240
In any case, our mission objective
just came falling into our laps.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.950
You could even call this lucky.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.950
Target approaching from ahead!

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.450
It's Bertholdt!

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.210
Our plan is as follows:

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.630
Levi Squad protects Eren
under Armin's command!

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.920
All others work together to
take down the two targets!

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.580
Roger!

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.380
Please wait!

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.090
Armin?

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.450
This is our final chance to negotiate!

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.950
Bertholdt! Stop right there!

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.310
Armin...

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.310
What are you trying to accomplish?

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.530
Bertholdt! Let's talk this over!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:02.080
If I agree to talk, would 
you all agree to die?!

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.750
We only want two simple things!

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.680
We want Eren and the demise
of humanity in the walls!

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.960
That's the harsh truth of reality, Armin!

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.020
It's all been decided already!

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.200
Wha--? Wh-Who decided any of that?!

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.020
I did...

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.150
Huh?

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.770
What was that?!

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.740
I decided it!

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.150
Your lives are coming to an end right here!

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.120
That's very unfortunate!

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:38.500
I was hoping... I wouldn't have to
hear Annie's screams any longer!

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.210
The only one who can save her from
the savages in the Military Police...

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.500
...is you, and no one else!

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.800
At this rate, she'll end up
as feed for the pigs!

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.720
Fine by me!

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.470
Huh?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.890
Let 'em feed her to the pigs!

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.450
If they really have her, that is!

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.230
What's the rush, Armin?
Aren't we going to talk?

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.640
Did you think that if you talked
about Annie, I'd lose my cool again?

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.620
That since I'm the meek and timid Bertholdt,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.660
you could fool me into letting my guard down?

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.040
Stand down, Eren. You should know.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.990
You've got a slim chance against him.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.290
This isn't your fight yet.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.750
Shit... Armin, why?!

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:31.970
I know what you're doing.
You're just buying time.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.840
Surrounding me with soldiers...

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.720
...and distracting me with this ruse
while the others finish off Reiner!

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.890
I can tell.

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.770
You're standing there shaking
so much, you can't do a damn thing.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.530
If you knew that much,
why did you even come talk?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.280
I wanted to know.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:17:00.580
To know whether, if I faced you guys,
I'd start whining and beg for forgiveness again.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.660
But...

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.280
...seems like I'm fine now.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:12.130
Yeah. You are precious comrades to me.
I also intend to kill you.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:17.920
Is that... because you think
we're spawn of the devil?

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.170
No.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.200
None of you have done anything wrong,
and you're not devils either.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.280
But you all still have to die.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.170
That's just how it is.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.950
Mikasa!

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.410
Armin! Don't chase!

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.330
There's no knowing when he'll transform.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.200
If we don't keep our distance,
we'll get caught in another explosion.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.240
I don't think Bertholdt intends to just yet.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.310
Reiner's on the verge of death,
so if he did, he'd finish Reiner off.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.780
We could take Reiner as a hostage
and fight him straight on with swords.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.230
We should, but...

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.060
It seemed like he had 
some sort of plan though.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.530
Still, was that really Bertholdt just now?

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.020
To me, he seemed like a different person.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.190
Me, too.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.580
Hurry! The Armored Titan is weak!

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.730
Let's finish him off!

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.600
Wha--?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.190
He's facing upwards now?!

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.050
We can't finish him off!

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.490
This is a very strange feeling...

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.990
I don't feel that scared at all.

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.230
I can see everything clearly.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.400
I feel like, no matter how this all plays out,
I can accept whatever happens.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.680
That's right, nobody's in the wrong.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.560
There's nothing we could do.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.320
Because this world...

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.960
...is just...

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.120
...that cruel.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.490
He's going up! Don't tell me...

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.120
But I thought Reiner was right over there!

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.330
Quick, get out of here!

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.520
Hange!

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.520
You guys alive?!

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.120
I don't know! Are you?!

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.500
I-I'm hanging in there...

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.580
Mikasa! Armin!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.450
You okay?!

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.650
We're fine.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.000
Hange Squad?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.760
They were so close to Bertholdt...

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.900
You don't think...

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.450
...the only ones who survived...

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.700
...are us here?

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.130
H-Hey...

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.880
Armin! What now?!

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.550
Wait for burning houses to flatten us?!

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.460
Armin.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.770
You're in command. We follow your orders.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.850
We retreat...

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.630
Rally at the commander for new orders.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.030
We'll engage the Colossal Titan in a
battle of attrition as originally planned.

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.490
Hold up, Armin...

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:05.950
Huh?

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.850
It'll be a disaster if we let Bertholdt
near the wall and the others.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.830
If the houses in the inner gate catch fire,

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.970
they'll be sandwiched between
the fire and the Beast Titan.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.960
Th-That means...

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.060
...we have no choice but to
defeat Bertholdt right here?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.260
And we have to do it...
with the people we have here?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.310
A-Armin!

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.980
The fire! Your orders?!

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.100
Hurry it up!

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.370
What will you do?

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.700
Beast Titan...

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.960
Is this exactly what you wanted?

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.550
With the Colossal Titan's arrival,
Shiganshina becomes a blaze.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.990
Meanwhile, Erwin and the others take
a serious blow from the Beast Titan.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.770
Next episode: "Perfect Game."
