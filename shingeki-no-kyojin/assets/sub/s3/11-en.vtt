WEBVTT

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.990
"Bystander"

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.050
Hey!

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.280
You wait right there!

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.830
Isn't this...?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.330
--Yeah... Not quite the 
Queen I was expecting.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.330
--Don't you run from me!
Listen when I'm talking to you!

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.560
And it's only been two months
since she was crowned.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.330
Seems like she's better
suited to run an orphanage.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.180
Do you know what the people are calling her?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.260
--Snacks come after our work is all done!

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.410
--The Cattle-Farming Goddess.
--Snacks come after our work is all done!

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.760
--In a good way, of course.
--You're such a piggy!

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.690
So we've finally got a goddess among us.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.770
At this rate, no one will remember
the chump who plugged up Trost, yeah?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.150
One of the reasons Historia decided
to become queen was...

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.900
...to do all this.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.240
This, meaning?

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.250
Taking care of the orphans and needy from
the underground to the edge of the walls.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.670
Since he was raised underground,
the captain supported her, too.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.040
When people need help,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.530
she said she'll come to their rescue,
no matter who or where.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.680
That's... what Historia wants to do.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.430
Oh? You're slacking again!

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.350
Uh...

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.930
It's getting dark, you know!

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.560
She's becoming more
and more like my mother...

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.390
Some goddess...

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.210
I hear your hardening
experiments are going well.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.360
Yeah...

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.450
But if we don't hurry... they'll be back.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.740
What would you do?

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.710
If you met Reiner and Bertholdt...
and had to face them again?

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.280
I've got no other choice... but to kill them.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.550
I hope we find out soon.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.750
About this world... and why it is like it is.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.760
All that we've done...
I don't want to regret any of it.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.130
Even the kids from the underground
have been smiling lately.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.030
This can't have been the wrong choice.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.980
Yeah.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.000
You've done great.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.040
That's not...

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.210
Though you're the one who said
humanity should get wiped out.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.930
Th-That was only 'cuz I got carried away!

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.350
What?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.600
Gimme that.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.060
Hey!

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.930
Eren's tired from the experiments.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.190
That's true. Sorry, Mikasa.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.400
Would you stop treating me
like some feeble old man?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.250
Due to the military purge, considerable
talent was lost from humanity's forces, but...

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.330
...the discovery of glowing
ore in the underground cavern

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.910
was one of many things gained.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.820
Also, with Eren's hardening ability,
a certain anti-Titan weapon was born.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.550
That's it...

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.640
Jam your head in here.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.520
Now!

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.190
Ooh!

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.360
A direct hit on the nape!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.400
This could be it...!

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.830
We did it! That's a 12-meter, crushed!

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.290
We did it!

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.080
Hell yeah! With this, we can kill Titans
without a single soldier fighting!

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.080
We'll hack down the Titans all day and night!

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.170
Say hello to the executioner from hell!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.750
We did it, Eren!

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.050
Eren?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.510
He probably overused his Titan powers.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.380
All he's done is hardening 
experiments lately.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.230
Sorry, Eren...

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.440
There's nothing to apologize for, Hange.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.510
Who gives a damn if I'm tired?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.750
Let's hurry... make weapons, and get going...

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.990
...to Shiganshina.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.660
We can win! We can beat 'em!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.240
With the new weapons,
the Titans will crumble like paper!

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.540
You're so damn worked up.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.510
Only you would be happy
about becoming a Scout.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.300
That's right! Didn't Hitch try
to stop you from joining?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.640
Hitch? Why would she?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.890
Why? 'Cuz you two are... you know?

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.930
I don't follow, but...

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.250
Hitch told me off, saying I wasn't
cut out for it and not to act cool.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.310
That if I stayed in the Military Police,
I could coast along in life.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.790
I thought she was better than that...

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.410
Told her I was wrong about her.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.490
You shit.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.080
--Huh?
--Marlo, are you stupid?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.040
He's a bowl cut imbecile.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.160
Why? Marlo said nothing wrong.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.810
Anyways, the only ones as worked up as you
are the recruits with zero battle experience.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.460
Whoa, whoa... Think you're
some veteran hero now?

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.750
Compared to you, I am.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.280
How rude. Weren't we in the 104th together?

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.390
Besides, we're not the only ones.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.380
Everyone in the walls is pumped up
about the idea of retaking Wall Maria.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.060
Is that so?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.320
Still, you all do seem different now.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.820
It's your faces, I guess...

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.700
What... exactly happened?

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.830
Wanna know?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.530
No... I think... I'll ask later.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.590
I'm outta here. See you later.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.130
Eh? So soon?

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.460
Tomorrow's a prep day, so I'm heading
to my village in the morning.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.230
Might find out something new there.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.230
Good night.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:49.900
Turning Conny's mom back to
normal... isn't impossible, right?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:50.940
Yeah...

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.240
If our understanding of Titans
keeps improving, someday...

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.040
You're telling me Titans are people?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.160
It's just speculation for now.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.410
About 60 years.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.310
It was like... I was stuck in a
nightmare that never would end.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.470
A nightmare, huh?

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.320
Eh?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.450
With all that's happened, 
it's been so vague...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.000
But who exactly are we fighting against?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.140
That is, are Titans just...

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.980
...people being tormented by some nightmare?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.860
For a time, I was... one of those Titans.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.530
Eren!

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.810
You still have bread and soup left.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.150
Save talking for after you've eaten.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.330
Right.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.450
Sorry, Mikasa.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.010
For crying out loud, Eren.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.720
I swear that's all you do lately...
mumbling shit to yourself.

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.720
When you should be trying
to remember that one guy.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.400
You saw, right? In the cavern
when those memories came back...

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.110
That guy in the Scouts
who you think met your dad.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.340
Yeah... That day, I'm pretty sure
he was with my dad.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.400
He's gotta know something.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.040
The thing is, though, I feel like
I've met the guy somewhere.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.790
You mean not Dr. Jaeger, but you, yourself?

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.420
I think so...

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.670
Smack your head and see if you remember.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.170
That's right, twerp.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.050
You might remember if you stopped
holding hands with Historia for once.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.850
Get a head-butt from the commandant.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.150
If that helped me remember, I'd--

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.450
Huh?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.710
The Cadet Corps commandant...

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.260
Keith Sadies!

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.800
Before Erwin, he was the 12th
commander of the Scout Regiment.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.190
It's been a long while since I've seen him.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.310
Commandant Sadies.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:36.030
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Executioner from Hell"
"A semi-automatic Titan extermination weapon constructed in part by Eren Jaeger's hardening ability and the wall. It can safely fell and eliminate Titans compared to previous methods."

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.910
What's wrong, Braus? Not sitting?

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.740
No! I am quite fine standing here!

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.040
If I recall...

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.080
Back in the day, I always used to
call you in here to chew you out.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.560
And it's only been a handful of months.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.840
I hardly recognize you all anymore.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.050
Commander Sadies...

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.060
Rather, Commandant...

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.760
With preparations to retake
Wall Maria underway,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.200
perhaps you can guess
what brings us here today.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.740
Eren. You resemble your mother so much.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.200
However, the fangs lurking deep
in your eyes are surely your father's.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.440
Tell me about him! Everything you know!

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.830
I know nothing... in the 
grand scheme of things.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.510
However, I can tell you a story
utterly useless to humanity.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.240
The story of my past... as a mere bystander.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.980
Twenty years ago. Wall Maria.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.300
In front of the gates of
Shiganshina, he was there.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.070
Hey, you!

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.810
What are you doing here?!

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.300
How did you get past the wall?!

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.260
Wh-What are all you doing outside the wall?!

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.950
Don't tell me... you're fighting?!

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.780
Huh?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.580
Was it the truth or a lie?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.260
He couldn't remember why
he was outside the walls.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.300
All of his memories had been lost.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.820
Except that he knew his
name was Grisha Jaeger.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.310
Who knew it's a crime to go into
Titan territory without permission?

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.940
I thought only you Scouts were
dumb enough to go outside the walls.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:47.240
Isn't there a law that jails idiots
who drink on duty, Hannes?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.990
Anyways, it's not like he hurt anyone, so...

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.780
Let's not report it, all right?

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.330
Yeah.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.670
Well?

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.660
What do you plan on doing now, Grisha Jaeger?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.290
I remember something other than my name.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.800
I'm a doctor.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.910
Introduce me to a hospital.
I should be able to help.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.640
Oh?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.220
Also... Do you think you could teach me?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.480
About this world... About the Scouts.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.150
About all of you.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.060
He truly knew nothing at all.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.980
Not about this world... or anything.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.000
I see.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.210
Although there's economic inequality,
there's peace within the walls.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.990
At the least, you don't live
in constant fear of Titans.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.680
That's good.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.640
That's good, huh?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.630
You're one of them?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.630
Eh?

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:59.310
Within these cramped walls,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.570
as long as there's food and alcohol,
some think that's good enough.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.710
Not once have they stopped to
think how wide the world might be.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.430
Is that why you venture outside the walls?

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.660
Is that what Scouts do?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.280
That's right.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.550
Does it seem foolish?

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.090
Not at all.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.800
The Scouts are wiser and braver
than anyone else in the walls.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.930
Your existence signifies
the freedom in our souls.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.300
You're the pride of humanity.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.310
Pride? We are?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.810
Yes.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.560
Come on, Keith.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.360
Recruiting for the Scouts again, are we?

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.940
N-Not this time, Carla. I'm just...

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.570
Oh, no. I'd never be suited
for that kind of work.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.530
Being a Scout takes someone special...

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.740
You have to be a chosen one.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.180
Oh, is that right?

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.980
A chosen one...

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.550
It was the first time anyone told me that.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.470
It's true, inside the wall was
much too cramped for me.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.020
Another day, another defeat...

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.680
Will you ever build a base outside the wall?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.440
If only I was commander, I'd show results.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.440
These idiots with their tiny brains...

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.530
I'd accomplish so much,
even they'd understand.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.200
And then everyone...
would have to acknowledge me.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.410
Grisha!

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.040
Carla caught the plague going around!

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.250
Can you help her?!

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.780
Put her in the rear bed.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.220
Dr. Jaeger...

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.720
My parents... have it, too.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.680
Don't worry, I'll help everyone.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.270
Dr. Jaeger!

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.500
My wife is well again!

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.740
Dr. Jaeger, thank you!

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.270
Congrats!

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.330
You're appointed as the
Scout Regiment commander.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.830
Congratulations!

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.030
Congratulations, Dr. Jaeger!

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.980
Shit, our base!

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.140
It's no use! Let's retreat, Commander!

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.030
The moron charges straight into death.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.150
He's always the only one who lives.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.910
I hear nobody on Erwin's squad has died yet.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.430
Wish they'd change commanders then.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.200
Someone special...

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.250
A chosen one...

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:07.170
Keith?

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.560
Carla? Who's this child?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.240
Eren. He's our boy.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.850
I guess you never got the news.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.600
My husband worried about you.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.400
Yeah... I'm sorry.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.100
Do you intend...

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.530
...on keeping this up until you die?

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.280
It's about time you...

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.550
Do you know why people live and
die without doing a damn thing?

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.170
It's because they lack imagination!

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.180
Their whole lives, for nothing!

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.720
They're not ashamed of a life
that produces nothing but shit!

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.180
They can't accomplish greatness... No!

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.640
They can't even understand it!

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.630
Not even the half of it!

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.860
So a girl who flirts with 
every man in sight...

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.320
...good for absolutely nothing
besides pouring drinks...

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.200
...will never...

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:18.930
Yes...

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.750
Normal people accomplish nothing...

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.800
Erwin... Will you take over as commander?

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.580
Special people do exist.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.450
This just means I was never one of them.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.220
Why did I not realize that simple fact?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.110
Wall Maria was destroyed!

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.690
Shiganshina District was decimated!

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.900
Us in Trost District are next!

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.370
Keith!

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.870
Oh... I know now...

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.910
It was your fault...

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.250
Eren.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.950
Wake up, Eren. Was your mother not with you?

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.580
Dad...

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.060
Mom...

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.740
A Titan...

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.760
...ate her.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.410
Eren.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.760
Avenge your mother.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.730
You must.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.510
I know you can.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.210
Let's go.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.260
Wait. Where are you going?

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.490
Don't follow us.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:03.790
Wait.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.520
Why don't you just do it? Avenge Carla...

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.110
Why? Is it because you're special?

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.010
Unlike me...

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.380
What if your kid is different, too?

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.310
He might not be a chosen one either.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:21.480
Right?

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.610
Are you going to curse... someone else now?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.210
This child is not like you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.370
He's my son.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:32.940
I beg you.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.860
Stay out of it.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.340
Thunder?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.640
And then I carried your unconscious
body back to the shelter.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.990
That is everything I know.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.090
So that's... it?

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.710
Now we know the real reason you resigned.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.800
Not to atone for the soldiers you killed,

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.970
but because you realized
you were never special.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.270
That's the childish reason you're here.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.560
Quit it, Hange.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.150
Screw your inferiority complex.
Don't run from reality.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.190
Isn't that what vowing to give
our hearts was all about?!

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.890
Please stop, Hange.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.980
The commandant was right.
I was never special or anything.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.800
But...

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.110
I'm the son of a special man.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.780
That's all it is.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.020
Your mother...

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.930
Carla said this...

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.470
Is it wrong not to be special?

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.030
I don't think that way.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.260
When it comes to my child...

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.380
...it's fine if he's never great.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.710
He doesn't have to be better than anyone.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:31.280
After all, just look at him...

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.480
He's so cute!

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.500
He's already special.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.630
Because he was...

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.390
...born into this world.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.030
And you, just like your father wanted...

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.750
...chose to set ablaze your life...

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.790
...which will burn to 
ashes outside the walls.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.150
In the end, I couldn't...

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.660
I couldn't change a single thing at all.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.000
I'm a mere bystander.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.480
The night before leaving for Shiganshina...

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.440
Now knowing of a world outside the walls,
with hope and fear in their hearts,

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.030
they pray for the future of humanity.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.540
Next episode: "Night of the
Battle to Retake the Wall."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Night of the Battle to Retake the Wall"
