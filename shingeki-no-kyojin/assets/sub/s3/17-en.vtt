WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.460
We die trusting the living who follow
to find meaning in our lives!

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.360
That is the sole method in which
we can rebel against this cruel world!

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.530
My soldiers, rage!

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.030
My soldiers, scream!

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.410
My soldiers, fight!

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.010
The commander!

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.580
Don't look back! Charge!

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.980
"Hero"

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.230
How pitiful...

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.120
To never learn from the mistakes of history...

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.980
It's a tragedy how King Reiss
stole their memories of the world.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.130
That's why they're repeating the same mistakes.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.010
In the end, they'll send every
last person in the walls,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.370
down to the children and
elderly, on a suicide charge.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.280
Saying if they're going to die,
they may as well die proud.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.140
It's bullshit!

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.400
I crushed it into dust?

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.800
What's gotten into me?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.510
Why are you getting worked up?

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.160
You're not like your father, right?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.410
You've gotta try to enjoy things.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.790
So let's turn them all into
proud little chunks of meat!

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.730
The second volley is coming! Fire!

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.650
It's coming...

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.550
Is this how I die?

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.780
I wonder what Hitch is doing...

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.110
Wait, I bet she's still in bed...

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.820
Sounds nice...

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.900
I don't get it... Why am I,
at a time like this...?

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.130
Yeah!

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.920
Game over!

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.670
You like that? I changed how I threw the pitch.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.340
Now you're done for.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.860
Fire!

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.150
Like I said... How is firing those
things going to help you?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.370
All that screaming...
What good is it going to do you?!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.930
Aww, you poor things...

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.510
Hmm?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.090
What's that?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.190
My Titans have fallen...

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.110
Huh?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.530
I need to watch out for a single soldier?

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.000
Yes. Captain Levi is dangerous.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.910
Is this Levi?

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.580
My nape!

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.210
What the--?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.920
I can't see a thing!

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.710
Did he take out my eyes?

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.720
My legs!

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.810
What happened to all that fun you were having?!

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.270
Tsk! I'll harden!

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.310
Shoot, I won't make it!

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.790
Come on, let's try to enjoy this!

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.510
After transforming, if your
body's severely damaged,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.260
it's too busy healing to let you transform.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.010
Isn't that right?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.980
Hey, answer me.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.050
Learn some manners.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.930
I can't kill him yet...

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.520
Isn't anyone out there still alive?

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.430
If they are, even on the brink of death,
this injection will make them a Titan.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.330
We can have them eat this guy
and steal the Beast Titan's power.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.710
Someone, just one...

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.260
...I can bring back to life.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.390
Hey...

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.060
Where are you going? Stop...

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.650
All of you! Go kill him!

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.660
It hurts! You've done it now, Levi!

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.860
It hurts!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.250
But your weapons have to be all used up.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.830
With this, you'll all be wiped out!

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.250
That might've been a close one,
but victory is ours!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.710
Wait...

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.760
I made a promise to him...

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.550
...that I'd kill you no matter what.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.570
I promised!

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.740
Why... am I... alive?

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.320
The others...

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.510
Hey!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.910
Is anyone else alive?!

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:07.380
That bastard...

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.130
To think he's seriously alive...

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.170
Why won't he just stay dead?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.760
What the hell do we do...
against something like that?!

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.140
Hey, Armin...

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.650
I think having Eren escape
is the best we can do.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.520
He's thinner...

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:27.800
Huh?

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.030
The Colossal Titan has gotten a little skinnier.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.760
It's just like Hange said!

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.950
The Colossal Titan is weak
in a battle of attrition!

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.410
Remember Eren's experiments!

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.120
He could only transform up to three times.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.860
If that's the case for a 15-meter Titan,
a 60-meter one might be less efficient!

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.310
And there's his steam attack, too!

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.450
I bet it's consuming everything except
his skeleton to produce that steam!

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.060
So what are you saying?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.920
Armin...

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.800
I have a plan.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.360
You all need to draw Reiner away.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.440
Eren and I will defeat Bertholdt ourselves.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.990
The two of us can win and I'm going to prove it.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.080
All right. Leave Reiner to the rest of us.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.380
Took long enough, dummy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.210
I really thought we were goners.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.470
I don't know why, but when it comes
to taking back freedom...

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.090
...strength flows through me.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.860
If this plan goes well, I...

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.310
...I won't get to look at the sea...

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.760
For some reason, when I think
of the outside world...

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.220
...courage flows through me.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.250
Eren, wake up!

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.040
Let's go look at the sea!

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.860
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"The Outside World"
"It's said a world beyond our wildest dreams extends outside the walls. It has fiery waters, lands of ice, sandy snowfields, and a saltwater lake called the sea that stretches far past the horizon. Some have joined the Scout Regiment to fight solely because seeing it is their dream."

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.370
Eren, that sums up my plan.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.620
As long as we properly execute it
and manage to trick Bertholdt,

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.760
this battle... is ours for the taking.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.850
Got it?! We've gotta trust that Eren
and Armin can handle Bertholdt!

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.480
We just need to keep Reiner
away from them if we can!

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.730
Let's keep him occupied from a safe distance!

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.070
Roger!

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.990
He ignored us?!

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.870
That jerk! He's changing his focus to Eren?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.410
We'll just have to kill him!

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:30.580
Mikasa!

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.520
Hey!

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.690
If we can't get Reiner's attention,
we have to finish him off right here!

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.190
It's on us to protect Eren and Armin!

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.990
Yeah, I know...

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.540
We've only got three Thunder Spears left!

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.490
Shit! But...

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.200
We've gotta try anyways!

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.040
'Cuz unless we fight, we can't win!

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.600
What was that? What got me?

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.550
A single attack took out my knee...

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.950
I can't remember much since then...

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.010
I'm blowing this whole area away.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.760
If you can, lie down with your
Titan body facing upwards.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.770
Bertholdt...

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.330
What the hell happened to me?

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.110
I don't know what's going on...
and I don't have much strength left.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.150
But... I know Eren's over there.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.660
And as long as we capture Eren,
that should still mean that we win.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.340
Isn't that right, Bertholdt?

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.290
I'll deal with these chumps quickly...
and come running to back you up.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.380
Reiner must be facing the four
who went that way.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.200
Strange... Only Eren and those guys
in the 104th survived the explosion?

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.220
To be perfectly honest,
I hoped to blow everyone up.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.710
But I'm used to these sorts of trials, Armin...

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.880
What's the point of waking Eren
when he's all battered like that?

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.320
I want you to show me.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.950
What will you leave behind
in your final moments?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.450
I know it's a plan I thought up myself,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.540
but its success mostly depends on
how long I can hold out for.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.790
Armin, don't tell me you're...

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.840
Eren... Sorry, but I can't die
till I look at the sea.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.840
So I'll have to call it quits
before it gets out of hand.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.970
The rest is up to you.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.020
Y-You know, because I'm just not a hero.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.020
No... You're wrong...

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.600
The Armin I know is...

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.530
Eren... You should know.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.730
We promised to go to the sea together, right?

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.700
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.240
So no matter what happens,
stick to my plan till the end!

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.640
Sh-Shit...

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.230
Eren!

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.740
I knew it... This battle is already won.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:53.990
He probably has a severe concussion
and can't even stand on his own.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.750
Enough of this...

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.540
Let's end it!

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.030
Armin...

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.950
All the way to the very end...

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.090
...you fought well.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.540
Eren! Armin!

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.610
No... We left it to them...

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.360
We're going to kill Reiner.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.370
If there's one way to take Reiner out
with three Thunder Spears, this is it.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.900
We'll pick a fight with him
while he still can't move.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.580
Either way this fight goes,
this is where it ends.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.690
Bring it on.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.560
Reiner!

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.060
First, I go as the decoy.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.940
Conny and Sasha will follow
with two Thunder Spears...

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.980
...and aim for Reiner's jaw from both sides!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.280
Sasha!

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.450
Jean!

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.290
One of them missed...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.460
If we blow off his jaw,
Reiner's mouth should open up!

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:31.090
Mikasa can use the last Thunder Spear
to hit his nape through the mouth!

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.150
His mouth isn't open...

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.160
Even so, I have to do it!

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.270
Why?

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.510
I can't blow Armin away...

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:46.940
Why won't his anchor come loose?

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.080
He shouldn't even be able to get close!

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.240
I knew it...

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.570
His bones aren't being consumed!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.660
The anchors stay put if they're not in muscle!

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:04.160
But most importantly, he can't move
his body while he's emitting steam!

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.210
But, Armin... Is this how you go out?

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.180
In all your wisdom, the best plan
you could come up with...

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.370
...was to get scorched to death like this?

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.470
I can't breathe! I have to let go...

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.560
No! Not yet!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.480
It's not enough!

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:28.260
I've gotta buy more time!

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.150
What's he trying to accomplish? A diversion?

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.330
But Eren's still beat to a pulp over there.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.870
Mikasa and them have their
hands full with Reiner.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.010
There isn't anything else to it?

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:44.830
If this really is the end for you...

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.960
All right... I'll make it quick for you.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.700
Hold on!

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.960
Don't let go!

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.260
I entrust it to Eren!

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.820
My dreams... My life... Everything!

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:09.270
This is the one and only thing I have to give!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.070
I'm sure...

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.480
...Eren will...

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.900
...reach... the sea...!

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.660
He'll look at...

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.620
...the sea for me!

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.850
Mikasa! It's too risky!

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.590
No, it's perfect!

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.560
Hange!

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.360
Now's your chance, Mikasa!

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.280
She can't be...

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.530
Reiner!

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:01.780
Come out!

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.910
It's over...

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.470
Next is Eren and the horses...

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.390
That's...

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.440
...hardening?

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.240
Gotcha!

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.200
A diversion?!

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.720
Which means Eren tricking me
into thinking he couldn't move...

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.830
...and all Armin's stalling...

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.980
...was just to buy Eren enough time
to make a replica hardened Titan!

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:22.070
They did it... to make me think
there weren't any enemies nearby...

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.890
To make me... lower my guard...

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.150
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.850
Dammit, I should've known...

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.030
Hey, why don't you fight back?

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.570
Huh?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.350
They pick on you 'cuz you don't hit back.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.500
Are you fine with losing forever?

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.970
I'm... not losing.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.350
Huh?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.680
Because I don't run.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.810
Hey, what's your name?

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:38.360
Huh?

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.950
I knew... you were more of a hero...

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.570
...than anyone else.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.870
Finding resolve, Eren and the
others defeat their enemies.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.430
However, what they lost cost
more than what they won.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.560
The despair alone has left them stunned.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.760
Next episode: "Midnight Sun."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Midnight Sun"
