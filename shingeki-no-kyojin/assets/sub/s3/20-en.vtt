WEBVTT

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.240
That naive day of my youth...

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.870
...when I...

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.950
...had to face the truth of this world.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.970
"That Day"

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.640
Move it, you vermin.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.520
What, more devil-bloods?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.320
Damn Eldians crawling around as they please.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.070
Grisha...

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.770
It's all right. Aren't you used to it?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.030
Look.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.290
It's right over that bank.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.300
It's so big...!

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560
Have you come to see the airship, too?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.610
Huh? Uh, yes...

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960
You from the Liberio Internment Zone?

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.440
Let's see your exit permit.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.130
Huh? Um...

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.320
I don't have one.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910
You entered the city without permission?

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.220
You know what that means, right?

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.330
Yes.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.940
Labor or beating. Which is it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.330
A beating...

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.210
Grisha!

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.440
Oh? You don't want to trouble your parents?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.340
Yes.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.220
I forced my sister to come with me!

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.470
Please give her punishment to me, too!

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.970
Very well.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.920
Grisha!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440
Here's another!

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.400
Man, go easy on him, Kruger.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.690
Come on. Let's get you on your way home.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.770
It was smart not to take off your armbands.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.710
Eldians without one are sent to
their paradise, even if they're kids.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.420
I'll go... home.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.270
Wait.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.090
Didn't you come to see the airship?

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.210
Might as well see it.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.720
The following day,
my sister was found in the river.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.770
I showed the girl the Liberio gates
and went on my way.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.820
I'm busy with work, you know.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.700
Eldian kids shouldn't be roaming the city
without permits in the first place.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.580
It seems that your son doesn't
grasp the place of his people.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.200
Shouldn't you be teaching him the sins
that your ancestors committed?

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.960
--I knew that man from Marley Public
Security was lying through his teeth.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.960
--If that's not enough to make 
him behave, put a collar on him.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.650
He had been slacking off
and was napping on the bank.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.800
He wasn't busy at all.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.010
Though my mother grieved, my father...

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.760
Thank you so much for your guidance.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.230
I assure you, I'll teach
my foolish son to know better.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.310
He demeaned himself to the men.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.270
I began to hate that man and my father
so much that it made me dizzy.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.330
But more so, I cursed my own foolishness.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.740
One thousand, eight hundred
and twenty years ago,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.500
our ancestor Ymir Fritz made a contract

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.580
with the Devil of All Earth and
obtained the Power of the Titans.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.960
Upon her death, Ymir's spirit
was split into the Nine Titans

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.110
who formed the Eldian Empire.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.200
After defeating the great nation of Marley,
they ruled over the continent.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.510
Thus began the Dark Ages...

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.310
The Subjects of Ymir called other races
inferior and began to oppress them.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.730
They stole lands and fortunes,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.070
and forced other races to bear their
children to increase their numbers.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.310
Their ethnic cleansing continued
for some 1,700 more years.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.540
But the once great nation of Marley

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.910
plotted to subvert Eldia
and its arrogance from within.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.250
They brought seven of the Nine
Titans under their control

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.760
and were victorious in the
Great Titan War 80 years ago.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.510
The Eldian King at the time erected
three walls on the island of Paradis

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.370
and fled there with many of his people.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.270
Our ancestors were abandoned and
left behind on this continent, but...

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.850
The gracious people of Marley
let us live and stay on their land...

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.720
My father was talkative for someone
who had just lost their daughter.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.500
He obeyed his master's command

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.440
and gladly shamed his own ancestry,
much like he was their dog.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.790
That man was telling lies.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.880
The truth wasn't good for him, so he lied.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.800
Quiet. The walls here are thin.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.720
I bet he's the one who took Fay and--

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.900
Silence!

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.310
I told you... Our ancestors
did terrible things.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.810
They believed in eugenics
and tried to cleanse--

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.100
Fay and I did nothing like that!

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.890
We were just walking around!

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.440
What is wrong with you?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.240
Are you that eager for all of us
to get shipped off to paradise?

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.730
Listen, Grisha...

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.880
It doesn't matter that we're not
directly responsible for the sins.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.070
But what we are able to do is live
humble lives within this internment zone.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.700
I'm begging you. Please don't
lead us all to the same fate as Fay.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.220
I wonder who was truly in the wrong.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.820
Was it me or this world?

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.560
Okay...

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.610
I understand.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.590
Perhaps it was both.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.780
I was ignorant and foolish.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.940
The world, irrational and insane.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.910
I discovered my own path 
in life when I was 18.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.520
It was around the time I was
to take over my father's clinic.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.250
What is that wound of yours?

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.260
This is proof I'm a patriot.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.290
A patriot?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.760
Your sister was killed by a man
in Marley Public Security.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.270
We have an informant inside
the Marley government.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.600
There are some things you need to hear.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.570
It can't be...!

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.240
You're kidding me...!

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.910
When I learned the truth of my
sister's death, I swore in my heart...

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.020
...that I'd show them who the real devil was.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.810
That my ancestors had done the right thing.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.460
In order to correct the world again,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.730
Eldia would have to be restored.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.800
Our informant in the Marley
government was called "the Owl."

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.560
He led the Restorationists
without ever showing himself.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.920
Look! This is the truth!

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.360
Our founder Ymir awakened
the Power of the Titans...

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.760
Cultivated the wilds... Built roads...

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.800
And bridged the mountains!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.740
She helped the people prosper
and develop this entire continent!

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.500
The history we were taught is just
a convenient deception for Marley!

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.750
Impressive, Grisha...

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.920
--You can read this ancient language.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.190
--That's right! Even if they fool the others,
they can't trick us true Eldians!

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.190
--No... I still haven't 
deciphered most of it.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.750
Then how did you know the truth?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.510
Isn't it staring us in the face?

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.390
I know it because I believe
in our founder Ymir!

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.810
We're the chosen children of God!
The Subjects of Ymir!

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.350
Yeah!

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.520
Comrades! The Owl sent us somebody!

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.480
Nice to meet you, everyone.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.400
My name is Dina Fritz.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.650
I'm a descendant of the royal family.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.850
I allowed fate to steer my life
and followed wherever it took me.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.290
She was the last descendant of royal
blood who remained on the continent.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.540
She provided info about the Titans
that only the royal family knew.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.350
This was the break we needed for victory.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.140
I'm sure of it!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.440
The King took the Founding
Titan into the walls!

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:06.440
If we obtain that, we can control all other
Titans and completely annihilate Marley!

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:12.460
But if he could wield a power that absolute,
why did he flee to an island?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.950
That is because he refused to fight.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.190
At the time of the Great Titan War,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.330
the King abandoned his role of
balancing the continent's powers

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.700
and moved the capital to a remote island.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.530
And so, these wretched days we live

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.490
all began when the King
turned away from conflict.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.970
Let's fight!

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.510
The true royal family held their ground
on this continent for the sake of Eldia!

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.890
It's time we bring the Founding
Titan back to them!

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:52.230
My comrades! We'll overthrow Marley
and restore the pride of Eldia!

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.320
Yeah!

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.010
The next year, the two of us married
and were blessed with a son.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.010
His name was Zeke.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.210
A child with royal blood...

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.130
Someday, this child will
lead us all to victory...

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.380
As time goes on, people change...

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.090
As the world around us rapidly advanced...

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.700
...a turning point came
for the Restorationists.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.520
Listen up, Eldians!

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.570
--We will be selecting warriors from
various zones around the continent!

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.570
--The Marley government
needed Subjects of Ymir

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:43.490
--to serve as vessels for the Nine Titans
and become Marleyan warriors.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:43.490
--If chosen, their family will be granted 
the title of Honorary Marleyans and...

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.420
According to info from the Owl,
the reason Marley is making a move

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.750
is to prepare themselves
for a struggle for resources

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.960
as military technology advances.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.590
Though Marley leads the world using
the power of the Seven Titans,

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.560
the end of their dominance is nigh.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.100
A massive cache of fossil
fuel lies beneath Paradis,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.510
and gone are the days they can ignore it.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.230
But the King of the walls left this
warning behind 80 years ago...

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.570
"If you ever interfere with us,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.670
the millions upon millions of Titans in
the walls will flatten the entire world."

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.900
As long as this threat exists,
none dare to confront him.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.100
The thing is, the Marley government
has the same goal as us.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.930
To infiltrate the walls and
recover the Founding Titan.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.610
What do we do?

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.300
At this rate...

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.430
...Marley will get it before us.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.500
If that happens, Eldia won't see
the light of day again!

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.190
No... There's still a way for us...

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.890
We'll have my son Zeke...

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.560
...become a Marleyan warrior!

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.950
Got it, Zeke?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.530
Everything the Marleyans
are telling you is wrong.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.780
But more so than anyone else,
you have to obey exactly what they say.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.290
You're the one who will
save Eldia from disgrace.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.800
Okay... I understand...

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.800
But if anyone, I should have known...

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.360
How terrible the sin to besmirch
one's beliefs on your children...

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.440
Not as a child of royal blood...
Not as the hope of restoring Eldia...

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.540
But as my son Zeke, had I ever
thought of him that way?

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.600
In any case, Zeke chose to protect
himself and his grandparents...

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.730
In exchange for turning in his foolish
parents to Marley Public Security.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:52.000
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Humanity Outside the Walls"
"Though the humans who live outside the walls look no different than us and speak the same language as we do, their civilization appears far more advanced than ours. However, they view us who live inside the walls as a race of devils that have committed terrible sins."

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.770
We're here.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.500
This is...

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.910
...paradise...

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.930
That's right.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.090
The penal colony of Eldia
traitors: Paradis Island.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.310
This is where you'll serve
your life sentence...

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.920
As a Pure Titan, that is.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.470
Answer me! Who is the Owl?!

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.860
Please! No more!

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.600
I told you everything! It's true!

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.280
That's unfortunate. Let's do another.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.830
I've met you before...

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.320
When I was little...

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.340
You remember that?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.020
As if I could ever forget
what happened that day...!

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.350
Please, just kill me... Don't...

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.060
Keep walking!

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.360
Please not a Titan...

00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.440
Grice?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.780
Grisha?! What the hell?!

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.650
Why in the world did Zeke
betray us?! He's your son!

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.370
I was an idiot to entrust everything to you!

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.870
The Restorationists! Dina, too!

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.960
Say something!

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.560
I'm sorry...

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.420
Why did we let... a guy like you...?

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.780
Eldia is finished...

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.590
We've got a lively one here.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.760
You're free to go.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.930
Grice!

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.480
--Hey! Grice!

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.770
--Run straight north!
--Hey! Grice!

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.770
If you're lucky, you might 
make it to the wall!

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.030
Sergeant Major Gross?

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.660
Hmm? This your first time here?

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.950
If we let him run off,
the Titans we're about to make

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.160
will chase him down and leave the area.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.160
It won't be long till he's eaten.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.090
Isn't that right, Kruger?

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.140
Yeah.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.330
It's him... Without a doubt...

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.490
He's the one who killed my sister!

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.840
All right! We've got a bunch to do this time!

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.730
Let's get a move on!

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.990
Guys...

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.210
Don't do it!

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.720
Guys!

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.300
Stop it! Guys, stop it!

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.880
--It's Grice! Can't you see?!

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.380
--Kruger! He's so loud, I can't stand it.
--It's Grice! Can't you see?!

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.180
--Kruger! He's so loud it's annoying.

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.620
I still want to interrogate him a bit.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.470
Continue without me.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.190
Oh? A woman this time? What a waste...
If only you weren't a devil!

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.580
Dina...

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.740
Darling...

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.370
Why are you here? I... I told them
everything there is to know...!

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:15.870
She's a royal--!

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.200
Silence!

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.870
Could it be... he's trying to cover it up?!

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.630
Sheesh. Make him a Titan
to shut him up already.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.330
Grisha, I...

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.880
No matter what form I take,
I promise I'll come and find you.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.140
That's lovely. You'll make
a great Titan couple.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.850
Dina!

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.590
Where is this?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.020
Who... am I?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.560
Eren, relax!

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.370
You're in the stockades.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.250
You and Mikasa are serving
time for insubordination.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.520
Were you having a nightmare, Eren?

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.130
Yeah... I was...

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.850
You just said... "Who am I?"

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.780
Huh?

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.310
You did.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.060
Are you crying, Eren?

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.500
I feel like... I just woke up
from the longest dream ever.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.060
No... Not a dream...

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.830
Memories...

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.590
Just now, I was connected 
to my dad's memories.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:46.720
That Titan...

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.020
It was you...

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.530
Dina...

00:17:56.470 --> 00:18:00.930
Look! She's running after Grice
and forgot all about you!

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.520
I guess she fancies that guy more than you!

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.600
Shut up!

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.730
Did you say something?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.550
It's you!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.950
Fifteen years ago, the one who fed
my eight-year-old sister to the dogs was you!

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:19.920
Tsk.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.700
Let me get him off your hands.
You can head back to the ship.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.870
Um, yes, sir.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.530
What was that all about?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.120
The Sergeant Major wants some
time to have fun, rookie.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.250
It's best to leave it at that.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.080
Kruger. Are you done interrogating?
Let's have that lad dance for us.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.890
Dance?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.320
I remember you now, son.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.810
Let's not make you a Titan.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:55.860
I'll have this one turn into a 3- to 4-meter
Titan so you can fight him.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.860
Why would you... do something like this?

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.430
Do you get enjoyment out of
people getting eaten by Titans?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.370
Why, you ask?

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.310
Because it's interesting.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.750
Do you think that's a little crazy?

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.220
But you know, people actually
want to see cruelty.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.690
Peace can be such a wonderful thing,
but something about it is lacking.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.440
Losing touch with life and death perhaps?

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.940
We should live thinking this
might be the last day we've got.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.410
That's the only proper state
of mind for living things.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.760
I'm ready to accept it
when that day comes for me.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.280
That's because I've faced
this cruel world head on

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.260
and deepened my understanding of it.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:50.460
Yeah... It was educational having
my sons' dogs eat your sister.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.840
Do you not feel any remorse?

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:00.010
Well, I get what you're saying.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.710
If something like that happened to one
of my sons, it would crush my heart.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.390
You poor things.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.600
If only you weren't Eldians.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.110
Look. That's your people's true form.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:23.420
All it takes is some Titan spinal fluid
and you turn into gigantic monsters.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.450
The world needs to wipe out
every last one of you Eldians.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.330
That's the wish of humanity everywhere.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.810
What did you...?

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.500
Of course I don't feel remorse.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500
You're the murderers here.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.410
What were you Restorationists
planning to do to Marley?

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.590
Don't you feel any remorse?

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.890
It's a lie! I know the truth!

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.680
Our founder Ymir helped people
prosper on the continent--

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.600
Yeah, whatever.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.110
Since your history is so grand, go and
share it with your friend down below!

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.320
Stop it! Don't!

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.030
Hear that? Your sister is calling for you!

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.110
Dammit!

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.080
Well? Is it really that interesting?

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.690
You're...

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.230
I'm the Owl.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.240
Remember this, Grisha.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.490
A Titan uses their power like this.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.210
A Titan's power revealed by Grisha's past...

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.490
The men's fierce desire to pursue freedom...

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.570
is passed on to Eren.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.840
Next episode: "Attack Titan."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
"Attack Titan"
