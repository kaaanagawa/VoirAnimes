00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.990
"Old Story"

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.160
I was born on a small farm in
the northern region of Wall Rose.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.620
It was on land owned by
the noble family of Reiss.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.800
As far back as I can remember,
I was helping around the farm.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.180
But, my mother was always reading books
and not once did I see her doing housework.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.560
She was a beautiful woman...

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.650
At night, someone would
come for her in a wagon...

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.780
...and she'd go off to
the city wearing fancy clothes.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.110
For me, that was just life as I knew it.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.540
After I learned to read and write,
I picked up a book to imitate my mother.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.000
Only then did I know how alone I was.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.010
In all the books, parents cared
about their children.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.590
They talked, hugged, fought...
or so the stories went.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.060
I had never experienced any of those things.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.900
One day, out of curiosity,
I decided to try hugging my mother.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.090
I just wanted to see what
kind of face she would make.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.190
Mother!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.000
She ended up shoving me away, but that was
the first thing my mother ever did to me.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.250
That's why it made me so happy.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.420
If only I had the courage... 
to kill the girl...

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.220
Those were... the first words
my mother said to me.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.940
After that, she left the house
and began living somewhere else.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.580
And then, five years ago...
One night just days after Wall Maria fell...

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.550
For the very first time, I met my father.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.830
Nice to meet you, Historia.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.620
My name is Rod Reiss... I'm your father.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.380
That man... He was the lord
ruling the land we lived on.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.890
My mother I hadn't seen in years
looked terribly frightened.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.690
Historia... You'll be living with me now.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.860
This is a problem, Lord Reiss.

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.240
Let's avoid acting rashly now.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.740
Did the fall of Wall Maria
make you a little scared?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.830
Mother!

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.330
No! I am not the mother of that girl!

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.210
She has nothing to do with me!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.300
Oh? Is that true, Lord Reiss?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.680
Do you really have nothing to do
with this woman or child?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.730
So be it...

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.730
These two here have nothing to do with me.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.980
I thought that might be the case.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.240
What?! What are you...?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.740
You never existed.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.240
You never worked at the estate either.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.850
Nobody knows who you are.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.420
That's not... Master!
Please tell them that's not true!

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.100
Mother...

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.630
If only...

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.880
If only I never had you!

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.190
Those were my mother's last words.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.350
Wait.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.810
Moments before I was to be killed,
my father proposed an idea.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.330
That if I were to be sent far 
away and live out a quiet life,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.250
perhaps they could spare me.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.330
Your name will be Christa Lenz.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.690
Please forgive me for everything.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.920
In order to protect you, 
I had no other choice.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.520
F-Father...

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.830
I was always thinking about you.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.940
I've always dreamed of the day
I could hold you like this.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.780
You're special... Royal 
blood runs through you.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.030
It... does?

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.580
That's right, Historia.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.370
Our Reiss family is the true royal line.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.580
And because you're special, you're the one
and only person who can save all of humanity.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.090
Now, let us go, Historia.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.880
To the place it all began...

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.390
Sannes!

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.930
Are you... all right?!

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.980
Hey, don't tell me...

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.610
You didn't tell them anything, right?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.530
Our loyalty to the King is more--

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.900
Sannes!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.700
I can't stand to hear your voice anymore!

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.160
You've betrayed me since the very beginning!

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.460
To think how I trusted you!

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.500
Sannes! He never told us anything.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.710
In fact, we never questioned him.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.890
We threatened Ralph with a knife and
forced him to read this script that I wrote.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.930
That's all.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.940
Then...

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.000
I...

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.940
I betrayed the King?

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.660
Y-You devils!

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:02.960
I'm not trying to deny it, but... I'm sure
Nick thought the same thing about you.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.040
That's why I said what I did.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.130
That I was beginning to feel sorry for you.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.760
Look at how pathetic you are!
Grown-ass men wailing and crying!

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.760
It serves you right, morons!

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.350
See how you like spending the rest
of your life shitting in a tiny cell!

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.940
See you.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.940
Next in line...

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.970
This role of ours... There's an order to it.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.280
When one's role is done,
another steps in to start the act again.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.140
And thus, the world can never be rid of it.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.790
Good luck, Hange.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.510
Section Commander?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.630
Sorry... I made a mess.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.650
There was a cockroach.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.160
I see... Just one kick of yours
should've blasted it to bits.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.120
It's about time you fill them in.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.850
Oh... Yeah, I should.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.160
Eren will be eaten?!

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.170
Yeah.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.920
Eren remembered a conversation
that went like this...

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.120
Do you resent me for it?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.070
I'm not sure...

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.970
I... don't know.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.850
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.810
Speculating based on that, Ymir was a
Titan wandering alone outside the wall.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.230
Bertholdt, Reiner, and Annie
had a comrade that she ate.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.320
When a Titan eats someone,
they don't change back into a human.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.660
But, what if a Titan ate
one of Reiner's comrades?

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.240
They're humans who can transform into Titans.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.750
In other words, if a Titan eats someone with
that power, they revert back into a human.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.000
Furthermore, they obtain
the power of those they eat.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:17.170
In the other day's battle, Reiner was
throwing Titans at Eren, who had escaped.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.510
Eren has the power to
control Titans with his scream.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.560
He was trying to snatch
that power with those Titans.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.020
In that case, Eren is just a vessel
who is bound to be replaced.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:36.320
Basically, if the government has a Titan
of their own, they'll be the one to eat Eren.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.570
Calm down.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.950
Even if you go on a rampage,
they're not going to give Eren back to us.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.910
Anyways, we head for
the lands of this Rod Reiss.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.920
Get ready to leave at once.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.040
Yes, sir!

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.090
I'll go tell Erwin what we learned
about the Reiss family.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.180
I'm sure he's waiting to hear from us.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.800
Right.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.680
We can meet up on Reiss' land.
Hear from me at the usual spot.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:14.610
Excuse me. Commander Erwin,
Pyxis is here for you.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.980
The commander?

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.830
Yes, he wants to see you.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.610
Let him in.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.660
Sir!

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.450
Sorry about the late visit.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.130
I just couldn't stand still, you see.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.690
I finished reading your letter.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.610
I came with some thoughts of my own.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.850
But, first I need to ask... Are you serious?

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.100
Yes.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.930
In order to retake Wall Maria,
we'll overthrow the government.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.160
I knew this would happen one day.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.040
This cramped world can only 
hold people for so long

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.330
before they begin to lash out.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:17.170
And when that time came, I'd have to
point my gun at the King as well.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:25.090
If my guess proves correct, this plan will not
require military forces to take action.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.180
Nor should it be necessary for anyone to die.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.940
Oh? Do tell me then.
Is such a method possible?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.830
However, the groundwork for this
to happen is not quite ready.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:45.450
And if everything is not in order, me and
everyone else will be hanged, no doubt.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.080
Oh, that's all?

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.330
In other words, it's another huge gamble.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.910
It seems I may be a betting man.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.670
The news should come shortly.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.210
Until it arrives, I'd like you to hear
a story regarding my childhood.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.460
Hmm?

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.140
My father... He was a teacher.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.970
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Intelligent Titans (with power to transform)"
"An Intelligent Titan is conceived when a Pure Titan lacking intelligence consumes some other Intelligent Titan. By consuming an Intelligent Titan, it gains consciousness as well as the consumed Titan's powers."

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.060
What in the world?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.440
Section Commander, that was--

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.440
Yeah, I know.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.390
Excuse me!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.410
Erwin...

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.350
I thought as much.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.090
My gamble was right after all, Commander.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.000
One of the First Interior Squad confessed.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.340
The current royal family is a fraud.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.510
Reiss is the true royal family.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.510
My word!

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.430
Right now, Squad Levi is underway
rescuing Eren and Historia.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.140
Once they're recovered, we'll have
Historia Reiss enthroned as Queen.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.400
As one possessing the true royal blood.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.280
And you'll force the makeshift
King to relinquish the crown?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.160
To the true Queen...

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.370
Without spilling any blood,
we will overthrow the government.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.800
And in front of the people, we'll reveal that
the system as they know it has all been a lie.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.920
Very well. I'll back your plan.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.390
However, whether or not it should be
carried out is not for us to decide.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.930
You understand that, don't you, Erwin?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.460
Of course, Commander.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.440
Did anything come of the Reiss investigation?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.690
I found out as much as I could.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.450
From all that I learned,
one curious incident stuck out.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.610
Incident?

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.540
Commander Erwin! The Interior Squad
demands you turn yourself in!

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.960
They're making a scene in the middle of
the city that you organized a murder!

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.660
It seems the enemy's been
making plans of their own.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.920
Hange, get far from here.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.630
Huh?! What are you planning to do?

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.640
I need to be the face of the Scout Regiment.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.720
You should act at your own discretion.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.390
Furthermore, the next commander
of the Scout Regiment...

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.650
Hange Zoë, it's you.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.140
The Scouts are in your hands.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.990
Hey, he's here.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.530
It's Erwin.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.870
I take it you know who this is, Erwin?

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.380
The boss of Reeves Company.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.630
Mr. Dimo Reeves.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.800
Yesterday, and in this very place,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.840
Eren Jaeger was abducted 
by underlings of Reeves.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.270
However... that was all a mere scheme
between the Scouts and Reeves Company

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:03.420
in order to evade handing over
Eren Jaeger to the government.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:10.240
And then... when Reeves was no longer needed,
they killed the man to keep him from talking.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.130
The murderer is still at large
and must be holed up with Eren.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.660
What a convenient story that is.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.330
What you scoundrels are doing...

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.080
It's the same as monopolizing 
Eren's power for yourself.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.210
And that act violates clause six
of the Humanity Charter.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:29.420
You know which that one is, don't you?

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.480
To prioritize one's own gain over the safety
and longevity of humanity, yes?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.890
That's right.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:42.430
Therefore, in acknowledgment of violating
said law, all Scouts are to be apprehended!

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.150
Old man...

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.360
You think the fat cats 
will finally be satisfied?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.740
I bet Reeves would be glad to know
he proved useful in the end.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.830
There's still Levi to deal with...

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.790
I told you, he'll show up on his own.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.620
We'll crush him when the time comes.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.870
What do we do now?!

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.800
May I have a moment?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.890
Hmm?

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:26.310
Get away from my husband, you lowlife!

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.320
In the battle of Trost District,

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:34.860
Mr. Reeves delayed the evacuation
by trying to take along his wealth.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.330
So what?! Are you saying he deserved to die?!

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:44.830
However... given the current situation
with Trost on the verge of collapse...

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.630
He planted his feet in the city,
and using any means possible...

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.620
...he aided those with no place to go
while striving to revive the city.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.760
Except, by somebody's hands
that dream was extinguished.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.260
I promise you... I will avenge him.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.240
My father... He was a teacher.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.610
One day, we were learning history.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.120
To protect themselves from the Titans,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.430
humanity took refuge within the walls
and realized 100 years of peace.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:33.160
In doing so, any records of our
earlier past were lost for all of time.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.760
That's what we're all taught.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.640
However, I... having doubts of my own,
asked my father a question.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:49.120
My father evaded answering the question
and ended class as normal.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.020
But...

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:56.860
After we got home,
my father answered my question.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:58.990
He said the history books
given by the government

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.070
were full of contradictions and mysteries.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:08.590
My father continued to tell me more,
and even as I child, I was astounded.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:14.000
There's a reason he didn't tell 
that story to the entire class,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.590
but I wasn't smart enough to know.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.840
I'd been telling the other
kids my father's story,

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.100
and one day, the Military Police
came to question me.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.910
My father didn't come home that day...
He died in some accident in a faraway town.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:36.150
Based on what I knew,
my father was killed by the government.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:42.450
One hundred and seven years ago...
Humanity that fled into these walls...

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.160
The King had altered their memories
to make them easy to rule.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.120
That was my father's theory.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.880
Oh? Because if they hadn't done that,
civilization within the walls could never succeed?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.990
Yes.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.260
Ever since I was a child, 
I've been thinking...

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.140
Why did my father have to die for
nothing more than getting close to the truth?

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.890
Even those in the government would
believe what they're doing is just.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:14.680
However, I realized one thing about them...

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:21.130
What they're trying to protect is not humanity,
but their gardens, houses, and lands.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.990
Rather, if anyone dares 
threaten their authority,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.660
they'll be extinguished, whoever they are.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.920
In the end, there was nothing
to justify my father's death.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:39.090
My father was killed by human greed...
And by the foolishness of his own son.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.590
Before I knew it, my father's theory
became truth inside my heart.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.800
Now, my mission in life... It's to prove
my father's theory once and for all.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.900
The Scout Regiment murdered a civilian!

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:02.150
Some of them have fled capture!
They're still on the loose!

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.910
If you spot any of these persons,
report it immediately!

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.830
Told you, didn't I?

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:12.250
They're the ones who had that Titan battle here
and destroyed practically everything!

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.330
I bet they're planning to use that
Eren monster to wipe us out!

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.960
Captain, we bought the supplies.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.510
The Military Police were handing out these.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.470
If this is true, the 
Scouts will be disbanded.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.350
I heard they'll be hunting for us tonight.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.270
They're also putting guards 
on all the vital roads,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.980
and it's impossible to get 
through without a pass.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.320
Captain, what now?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.320
If we don't hurry, Eren...

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.900
Calm down.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.110
They're using a wagon.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.450
It'll take at least a day
to reach Reiss' territory.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:54.540
We'll have to use that time
to come up with a plan.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.210
Captain, I hear footsteps.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.840
They're coming this way.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.350
Those who throw away their life...

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.480
Those who believe in justice...

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.220
Those who protect the city...

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.260
Courage which swells up from memories
gives people the courage to fight.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.450
Next episode: "Trust."

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.540
