WEBVTT

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.230
Shit!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.160
Eren, you're awake?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.580
Just hang in there a while
longer. Everything's fine.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.000
Historia's all right?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.710
Eren, listen to me.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.170
My father has been an ally to
all of humanity within the walls,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.380
for many years past and many years to come.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.300
We were clearly mistaken about him.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.910
It's true that he's been a problem for the
Scouts, and his people did kill Pastor Nick...

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.860
But he didn't have any other choice.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.370
Everything he's done, he had
to do for the sake of humanity.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.780
Historia. Let me explain the rest.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.200
It's coming back to me... Yeah...

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.460
The last thing I can remember is those two.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940
How long has it been?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.720
Captain... Armin...
What happened to the Scouts?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.770
What's up with these walls,
glowing like that...?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.850
I can't tell if it's day or night...

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.920
No, hold on a second...

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.620
Haven't I been to this place before?

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.370
What's wrong? This is the first
time you've come here.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.370
Though, it wouldn't be strange
if you recognize it.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.990
What does he mean by that?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.800
F-Father, explain to Eren.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.990
Yes, I intend to.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380
However, there's something 
I want to try first.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.760
If we do this, he may 
remember all on his own.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.690
What... is this?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.030
These aren't things I've seen...

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.740
No!

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.780
Whose memories are these?!

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.120
This key!

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.400
Is this...?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.680
It can't be...

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.760
Dad?

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.030
Well?

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.560
Did you remember? Your father's sin...

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.010
"Sin"

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.020
You're amazing, Historia!
Look at how well you can read now!

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.440
That's only because you taught me so much!

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.940
Hey, we can't have this.
You've got a runny nose.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.950
You need to learn to be 
more ladylike, Historia.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.870
Here, blow.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.170
Ooh!

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.830
Good! Very well done!

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.080
Hey.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.920
Hmm?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.870
What does being ladylike mean?

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.200
Well... I suppose being ladylike means
being a lot like this girl right here.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.890
Christa?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.600
Right. You like Christa, too,
don't you, Historia?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.350
Yeah.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.350
Christa is always thinking about
other people because she's so kind.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.660
You should try to be like Christa, too.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.710
The world is full of pain and suffering,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.190
so you should live in a way to be
helpful and loved by everybody.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.230
Okay.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.120
In that case, I wanna be like you.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.040
Huh?

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.470
When I grow up, do you think
I can be just like you?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.880
Sure!

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.300
Whoa!

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.470
Sure, sure! That's perfectly fine!

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.530
Whoa...

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.480
I'm sorry, Historia, but 
it's time for me to go.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.310
You'll have to forget about me again.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.130
Until we can meet again.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.190
Huh?

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.080
Huh? Who was that girl just now?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680
What's wrong, Historia?

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.260
Why?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.560
Why did I forget about that until now?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.690
I was never alone.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.490
That girl was always there for me.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.530
She gave me books...
Taught me how to read and write...

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.130
And was so kind to me...

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.870
How could I forget about her?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.450
You met Frieda?

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.420
Frieda?

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.410
If it was a young girl 
with long, black hair...

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.420
it was most likely Frieda Reiss.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.180
She was your half-sister.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.580
She must have been worried and
came to check up on you occasionally.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.520
If she was erasing your memories,
it was all done to protect you.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.190
Huh? Erasing my memories?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.570
Yes, but touching your 
hand to him seems to have

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.570
uncovered those memories again.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.200
Um, Father?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.200
Where is Frieda at now?

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.210
I'd like to see and thank her.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.890
If she wasn't there for me, I...

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.550
I need to thank her for
what she did for me then.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.200
Frieda is no longer in this world.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.780
Huh?

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.890
At one time, I had five children.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.820
But my wife and all of my 
children, Frieda included,

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.090
were killed five years ago
by his father, Grisha Jaeger.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.730
Grisha was a person with
the Power of the Titans.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.920
I do not know who the man was, but...

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.690
...his goal was to steal the power
the Reiss family possessed.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.640
This power Grisha sought to obtain...

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.320
It was the Power of the Titans
residing within Frieda.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.710
Frieda's Titan was superior 
to all other Titans.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.780
You could say her Titan
had unsurpassable power.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.690
However... She did not have
the experience to properly wield it.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.710
Unable to unleash her true potential,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.430
she was eaten by Grisha 
and he stole the power.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.350
But that's not all...

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.830
He then attacked my entire family.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.890
His rampage sought to 
eradicate the Reiss family.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.190
He crushed the 14-year-old Dirk
and 12-year-old Abel.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.810
He trampled over my wife and 10-year-old
Florian still clutched in her arms.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.840
Lastly, he took my eldest son, Ulklin,
and squeezed the life out of him.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.420
Miraculously, I was the only
one who made it away.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.880
Unbelievable...

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.160
That's how she...

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.050
Why would he do such a terrible thing?

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.530
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.480
What the hell are you guys
blabbering about in here?

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.810
I hope you know a buncha shit
is going down outside.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.610
Kenny? What happened?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.620
The Scouts started a coup d'état
and all the regiments changed sides.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.750
Everyone knows the King's a big fake,

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.870
and all the big shots 
ended up getting captured.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.630
Oh yeah, it's a royal shit show.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.050
Only a matter of time till they show up here.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.880
You oughta wrap it up lickety split.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.850
Yes, all right.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.140
Take your Anti-Personnel Control
Squad and defend the entrance.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.470
I believe I told you already that

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.250
I need you and your crew 
to leave for the ceremony.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.980
Whoa, now, King. Did I make you mad?

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.740
Sorry 'bout that. I'm just 
so worried about you.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.740
Kenny... I trust you. Go.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.130
So do I, King.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.690
Tsk.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Scream"
"Among those with the Power of the Titans, some have a special 'Scream.' While the Female Titan can use a 'Scream' to control Pure Titans, the royal family's Titan has a similar ability and is believed to possess the power to alter human memories as well."

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.420
From now on, you'll be digesting
everything you eat from the bottom up.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.680
Plus, the only clothes you get to wear
start at your knees and below.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:55.360
Of course, once a week we'll take you outside
and parade you around to the public.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.610
How beautiful...

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.720
This may very well be the finest
work of art ever conceived.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.280
All those decades I spent
envisioning it paid off.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.830
But see, only after you're publicly humiliated
in front of the same people you tyrannized

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.500
will this masterpiece be truly complete.

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.790
Zachary!

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.750
You just wait and see!

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.300
The only blood in you is slave blood!

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.170
It's nothing like our noble bloodlines!

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.230
Soon enough, you'll lose your memory
and even forget how to shit!

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.770
That one insult of yours
is getting pretty stale!

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.230
Don't you have anything new?!

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.880
This could be bad, Erwin.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.910
All the officials are saying similar things.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.240
It's just as your father speculated.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.830
The Reiss family must be able to alter
people's memories as it suits them.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:13:00.340
From the sound of it, certain bloodlines,
including theirs, are immune to the effects.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.840
How is that even...?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:10.320
If Reiss is able to obtain Eren's "Scream,"
this uprising will amount to absolutely nothing.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.370
As proof of that, they're spilling
all their secrets with no shame.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.180
As if saying we'll get what's coming to us.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.500
I see...

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.310
In other words, we may forget
even that fact altogether.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:30.990
Though, I suppose having them
experience torture by the hands of Zachary

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.240
is better than nothing in my book.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.740
I don't understand that man.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:39.750
To think he dedicated so much
of his life just so he could do that.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.640
Commander, you knew about him?

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.810
Mmm... 'Twas a slip of the tongue.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.880
Indeed...

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.140
I suspected Dhalis Zachary 
had such ambitions.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.950
Unlike you, I'm not very fond of gambling.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.270
And also, unlike you...

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.520
...I value the number of remaining
humans over my own life.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.380
The reason I backed you was because I
believed it the superior choice for humanity.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.040
Had the government been the favorable choice,

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.400
I was prepared to fight against Zachary.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:23.190
To think, we're comrades just following
a coup d'état, and look what I'm saying...

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:29.090
I once heard a song that someday humans
will stop fighting, but when will that be?

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:31.800
Commander!

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.590
All troops are prepared and ready!

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.420
We're ready to go!

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:44.120
Humans will continue to fight one another
until the day there's one human or less.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.030
I was hoping for a better answer
than some bleak hyperbole.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.280
All troops, fall in!

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.040
Our mission to recover Eren
and Historia will now commence!

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.250
We make for their location, believed
to be the chapel on Reiss territory!

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.180
Understand?

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.180
He's Kenny the Ripper.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.080
If he's there, he'll be our biggest obstacle.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.660
In terms of how much of a threat he is,
equate him to me as an enemy.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.470
No... With those weapons of his,
he's deadlier than me.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.480
Then he's unbeatable, at least for us...

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.940
If we could meet up with the troops--

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.980
Absolutely not.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.770
I know, absolutely not!

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.490
If we wait until morning, Eren 
might end up getting eaten!

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.490
Though, if what the captain said is true,
it's not like he has no weak points.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.990
For real, Armin?

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.210
Yeah, I'm sure he's trained plenty, but having
combat experience is something else.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.000
I wonder, how is it that you
lived with Kenny the Ripper

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.800
but know almost nothing about him, Levi?

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.220
Sorry, but I only found out
his full name not too long ago.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.330
Apparently, it's Kenny Ackermann.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:55.970
He some relative of yours?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.730
I heard from my parents when they were alive
that my dad's side, the Ackermanns,

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.950
were persecuted in the cities.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.900
My mom's family was Oriental,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.060
so being a different race meant 
they didn't fit in anywhere.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.660
Both were people chased deep in the
mountains near the edge of the walls,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.130
so that's how they met and married.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.320
But I never found out why the
Ackermanns were persecuted.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.760
My dad didn't seem like a
different race like my mom was.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.380
Has there ever been a moment

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.480
where it's felt like power 
suddenly awakened inside you?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.850
There has.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.260
Kenny Ackermann had a moment like that, too.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.240
One time, out of nowhere,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.400
he felt an absurd amount of 
strength surging within him

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.980
and he knew exactly what he had to do.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.710
I've felt moments like that, too.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.060
Fess up, Gramps.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.980
You're about to die anyways, right?

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.110
Kenny...

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.710
Were you out killing more Military Police?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.150
Yeah...

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.410
If you're talking about
those goons snooping around,

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.870
they're in the ground helping the trees grow.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.500
Speaking of branches,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.690
the branch family moved down 
south around Shiganshina.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.360
But it turns out someone's interfering 
with their business there, too,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.940
so they're still poor as hell.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.350
What's the big deal?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.580
Didn't the Ackermanns use to be a
family of warriors protecting the King?

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.900
Now the whole family is on
the verge of extinction.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.650
The hell did you do to
piss off the King so much?

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.410
C'mon, fess up.
Wontcha tell your cute grandson?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.970
What cute grandson?

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.920
The one who's Kenny the Ripper,
terror of the capital?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.340
The Ackermann family isn't hated by the King.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.030
It's just, they're afraid of us.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.930
It's because the King isn't able
to control the Ackermann family.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.310
Control?

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.190
I personally don't know all there is to know.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:19:00.070
But it's true that our family was once the
King's sword and one of their vital supporters.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:06.080
However, the King passes down the Power
of the Titans from generation to generation.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.000
Huh? What's this Power of the Titans?

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.790
It's an immense power they possess

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:18.530
to alter all of humanity's memories
and make them entirely forget the past.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.560
Except for a few noble bloodlines.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.530
Among them, there were two groups
that turned their back on the King.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.650
That is, the Oriental clan
and the Ackermann family.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.470
Hence the persecution.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.200
Such a dreadful story.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.910
It ain't the heartwarming story 
you wanna hear on your deathbed,

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.120
but I did find my little sister.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.100
Kuchel's been working at
a brothel in the underground.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.460
Got pregnant by one of her customers.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.550
Wants to have it and won't listen to me.

00:19:58.170 --> 00:19:58.710
Hell...

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.910
Being born in this piece of shit world...

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.850
Ain't a single damn dream 
worth suffering through it.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.350
Found it.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.350
A hidden door.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.770
Eren's gotta be in here with the enemy.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.980
Hopefully the layout in
there is like I predicted.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360
These presents better pay off, considering

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.400
we went out of the way to prepare them.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.780
There's seven enemies at the least.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.910
You can be sure Levi's among them.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:37.130
As you know, Levi got completely 
ambushed last time

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.760
and yet he still killed 12 of our comrades.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.180
The rest of the Interior Police
are out of the picture,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.360
not to mention the government lost control.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.540
It's a bad situation all around.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.240
In a world as tiny as ours,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.230
dying would be preferable to the life
that awaits us the second we surrender.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.340
Then again, is a life stuck
in these walls any different?

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.330
We've got an enemy we can't defeat
and all we can do is wait

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.700
till they break down the 
walls and destroy us.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.400
We chose to join the Military Police,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.040
aspired to be Interior Police, 
and joined up with Kenny.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.330
All to seek meaning in our meaningless
lives in this meaningless world.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.340
Let's keep believing all 
the way to the end...

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.470
...that Kenny and his dream can
turn the tables on this world.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.390
All right, we're good to go!

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:36.580
Are we?

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.900
Is everyone ready to get 
their hands dirty, too?

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.070
Guess so.

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.150
To protect his wish...

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.850
To rescue him...

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.750
To carry on his memories...

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.210
Their many feelings lead
straight towards battle.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.820
Next episode: "Wish."

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.570
"Wish"
