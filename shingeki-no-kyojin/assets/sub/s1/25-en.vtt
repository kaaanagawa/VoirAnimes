WEBVTT

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.770
We don't have a choice.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.770
The world is cruel.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.950
I'll wipe you out...

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.360
No...

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.370
I'll kill you!

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.340
That day, humanity remembered...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the terror of being ruled by them.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.300
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.920
Eren!

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.580
Eren...

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
The Wall 
Raid on Stohess District (3)

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.850
Let us pray for the well-being 
of the three goddesses,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.020
Maria, Rose, Sina.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.770
For our continued peace and safety...

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.450
You must not doubt the holy walls!

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.780
The walls of light, born of god's hand,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.830
will become stronger through 
our devotion and faith.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.670
An innocent heart, believing in god,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.790
is our only protection from the Titans!

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.670
Our only way to keep them at bay—

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.960
A Titan?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.850
What's it doing here?

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.490
No...

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.170
Stay away from the walls...

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.030
Not the walls!

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.720
This time, it seems he's retaining control.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.640
Yes.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.440
But Eren's never managed 
to beat the Female Titan.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.570
Now that he's a Titan, 
he must be prepared to fight...

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.570
He won't go down so easily—

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.750
Willpower alone isn't enough in battle.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.620
You know that, Jean!

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.950
Defeating Annie will require far more...

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.350
An open area!

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.460
The Female Titan's heading for an open area!

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.670
We can't use Maneuver Gear there!

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.970
Split up and work your way 
around to the other side!

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.940
Roger!

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.640
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.680
This doesn't make sense...

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.820
What's a Titan doing here?

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.360
Annie...

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.590
You always acted like you found 
everything incredibly stupid.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.630
You always seemed bored.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.440
But there were times 
when you looked alive...

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.100
When you were showing off your martial arts.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.400
You said none of it mattered, but...

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.900
To me, it didn't look like 
you really believed that.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.410
I just thought you were a terrible liar...

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.200
Tell me, Annie...

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.130
What are you fighting for?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.920
What could have been worth 
killing all those people?!

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.280
What is this?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.900
Squad Leader,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.050
even if we can capture the Female Titan,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.280
they might destroy the whole city first!

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.680
We do it, regardless.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.450
That was Erwin's decision.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.000
Be ready to capture her.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.960
Yes, sir.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.840
Eren...

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.840
No one told me anything about this...

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.290
Why are Titans fighting here?

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.680
What's going on?

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.170
Titans fighting each other?

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.110
Yes...

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.600
The damage to the city is unbelievable!

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.230
There are many casualties, 
both civilian and military.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.110
Erwin! Is all this due to your plan?!

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.030
That's correct.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.580
All of this was my personal decision.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.290
I don't intend to make excuses.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.300
You must have known what would happen

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.500
if you executed a plan like this in the city.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.630
How? How could you do this?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.570
To lead

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.520
humanity to victory.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.560
Bullshit!

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.620
You're a traitor!

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.440
I could execute you right here and now, 
and none of the brass would even care!

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.740
That's fine by me.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.530
But then you must assume command.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.580
You must not let the Female Titan escape.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.280
Paehl's in charge of formation.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.200
Vyler oversees supply.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.040
Work with them to drive her 
to the east wall at all costs.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.040
W-Wait... Wait!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.380
Are you...

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.800
Are you really telling me

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.090
that this will help humanity?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.930
I believe it is a step forward.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.060
Lower your guns, all of you.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.560
Handcuff him!

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.810
Yes, sir.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.800
Deploy all of our men.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.360
Your priority is civilian 
rescue and evacuation!

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.280
Yes, sir!

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.350
Erwin, a trial will decide your punishment.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.660
Once this is over, I'll submit to one with pleasure.

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.550
Levi, you stay put.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.420
You dislike pointless deaths.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.770
Yeah, you're right.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.470
I despise it, whether it be mine or my 
causing someone else's.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.180
Someone who can't sacrifice anything

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.000
can never change anything!

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.880
In order to overcome a monster, 
you must be willing

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.960
to throw aside your humanity.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.410
Annie is certainly capable of doing that...

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.580
Annie...

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.290
Annie!

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:49.900
Annie...

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.650
Your dad is the only one on your side.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.260
I'll...

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.300
kill the Titans...

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.390
Every last one of them!

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:48.370
Eren!

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.530
That's...

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:54.290
Eren!

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.300
Don't!

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.840
Right now, we don't know if 
Eren can recognize you...

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.230
H-Hey...

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.210
Hey!

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.810
The wall!

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.850
Does she intend to climb over it?!

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.570
No...

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.410
She's going to get away!

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.280
I won't let that happen!

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.840
Annie...

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.850
Fall.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.550
Annie...

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.150
I was wrong.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.120
It's too late to ask your forgiveness.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.660
But...

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.870
There's one thing...

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.240
I want to ask of you.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.290
You can make the whole world your enemy...

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.970
I'll destroy the entire world!

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.980
Even if the whole world hates you,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.590
your dad is the one person who is on your side!

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.570
Crap... He'll eat the girl inside, too!

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.190
Don't, Eren!

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.360
Eren!

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.340
I am free...

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.870
So promise me...

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.020
That you will return...

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.180
What happened?

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.650
What?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.020
They're fusing?!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.200
Eren!

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.860
Don't eat a valuable witness, you idiot.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:15:00.960
What We Can Share So Far: The Walls (1) - The year 784... One blistering hot night, a miner decided to dig under Wall Sina, to live within the inner ring. "Life in Wall Sina would be pretty nice." That thought had come to him suddenly a few days ago, as he dug with his shovel, deep in a coal mine. In a way, you could call it divine inspiration. And so, for the next few days, he wandered along the wall, finally settling on a spot where the dense forest pressed against it. No one would chance upon him, and the overhead leaves would shelter him and his task from the prying eyes of the guards above. On the next night, he began. Using his trusty shovel, the miner began to dig. The work went smoothly, and before long, the pit was as deep as he was tall. When he could no longer fling the dirt outside it, he stuffed it into sacks, climbing a ladder to discard it. Completely dedicated to the task at hand, he took only a few short breaks to drink water and to ease his weary muscles. After spending twenty years of his life digging without a day of rest, the miner knew he was an expert at it. And during that time, he'd learned to dig deeper, more quickly, and more efficiently than anyone else. Tunnels that would stump any other miner were no match for his shovel. But that day was different. He dug for hours, yet never seemed to get anywhere. As he dug, he probed to either side of the main pit with his shovel, but it was of no use. The wall's foundation seemed to go down forever, deep into the earth, blocking his path at every turn. Still, he persevered. Any thought of digging his way to an easy life inside Wall Sina had been long forgotten. He simply wanted to conquer the wall. "I'm willing to bet all the years I've spent digging that I will beat this wall," he said to himself, wiping the sweat from his brow. The hole was more than four or five times the miner's height when he struck hard rock. He wondered, "Bedrock?" But it appeared to be of the same material as the wall's foundation itself. The miner swung his shovel down hard on the rock. The shovel shattered, but the rock was unscathed. The miner sighed, and his sigh was deeper than any hole he'd dug in the previous twenty years.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.950
What We Can Share So Far: The Walls (2) - With a frown, his friend questioned, "The Wall?" "It's weird, isn't it?" the miner said, lifting his drink to his lips. "Who knew that the wall went so deep underground?" The pair sat across from one another at a table in the back of a tavern in a seedy part of town. Most days, the miner would go there with his friend, his only friend, after work. That day, the day after he'd tried to dig under the wall, they'd gone there as usual, once the workday was done. And then, the miner told his friend the story, certain that his friend could keep a secret. "Maybe we're surrounded by walls not only above the ground, but below the ground, too," said the miner. "Tell me something... What, exactly, are the walls?" His friend cut him off with a cough, glancing around the tavern. The patrons were all busy drinking, hitting on the tavern maid, or yelling at one another. No one was watching them. But even so, the miner decided not to say another word about it. If anyone heard him, the Military Police would be there in an instant. "Does it really matter?" his friend asked. "Just keep on living here as you always have. You're poor, but you have a job every day, and enough money that you can drink. Isn't that enough?" "Yeah," the miner replied. "Yeah, it is. I'll go back to digging. In the end, I guess that's my lot in life." But the next day, the miner didn't show up for work. Nor the next... Nor the day after that. His friend went to his house many times, but never saw any sign of him. The miner had no relatives, nor other close friends, so there was no one to ask where he might have gone. Unsure what to do, his friend eventually went to the Garrison, and told them the whole story. The next day, the Military Police and the Garrison organized a large-scale search party. It was a little excessive for one poor miner, even if that miner was a criminal who'd tried to pass under the walls. His friend couldn't understand why they were so bent on finding him. But they never found a trace of the miner, nor even the pit he'd dug. And one day, his friend also vanished, never to be seen again.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.600
Eren...

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.700
Mikasa?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.520
Where's Annie?

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.530
Damn it...

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.080
What is this?!

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.280
We've come this far, and you 
still won't say a word, Annie?!

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.040
Come out!

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.040
Come out and finish what you started!

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.290
Hey, this isn't fair... Annie! Annie!

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.970
Stop it.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.260
It's useless.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:56.010
Use the wires to make a net!

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.770
We'll tie it up and carry it underground.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.730
Yes, sir.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:07.780
If we can't get any information from Annie, 
what do we have to show for all this?

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.070
We have caused so many deaths.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.530
And yet, despite all those lives lost, 
so many mysteries remain.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.290
What did we accomplish?

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.430
I don't suppose we can call 
this operation a success...

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.170
No.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.950
We have ensured the continued 
survival of the Survey Corps,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.680
most likely by the skin of our teeth.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.680
I hope so.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.030
Erwin...

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.120
I have several questions 
about this plan of yours.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.890
If you had a suspect,

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.710
why did you not ask the Military Police for help?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.130
Governor, that's because...

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.960
With the Female Titan potentially having allies,

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:12.460
I needed to limit the operation to 
those I was certain were uninvolved.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.440
But what about the damage to Stohess from this?

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.260
Our best efforts were not enough.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.470
You have our sincere apologies.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.560
Do you think apologies are enough?!

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.650
Had we left her alone,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.830
the walls would have been destroyed, 
and far more would have died.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.480
I see.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.830
And after all the deaths this operation has caused,

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.240
do you have conclusive proof that it 
has forestalled humanity's extinction?

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.570
I can't imagine we'll be able to get anything

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.750
from Annie Leonhart now.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.920
No, I doubt it would be possible.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.800
In other words... This was all for nothing?

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.970
Eren...

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.620
Are you doing okay?

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.030
Yeah...

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.620
I've healed so fast, it's almost creepy.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.030
I heard that Annie's still frozen.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:24.580
Yeah.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.420
Damn it!

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.000
We got nothing from that 
massive operation!

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.130
She was willing to go that far 
to protect the information.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.180
Yeah, she got away from us.

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.640
Eren's the one who allowed it.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.920
Right, Eren?

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.710
Without that one instant...

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.280
Yeah,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.690
you're right.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.780
I couldn't do it.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.440
When I saw Annie, I froze.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.540
Armin Arlert...

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.500
Jean Kirschstein.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.590
It's time for your questioning.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.500
Yes, sir.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.380
They're starting with us?

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.190
Okay, see you later.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.130
Yeah.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.190
It felt good at the time, you know...

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.150
It even felt good to get all beat up.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.700
I thought I wouldn't even mind dying.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.530
Eren!

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.460
That isn't how I feel now.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.750
I'm glad that you

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.850
came back.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.360
It's impossible for me to understand.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.570
Abandon your humanity to overcome a monster.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.200
That's the only way to win?

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.530
It's one possible way that humanity 
might defeat the Titans.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.530
I think Eren can do it.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:28.750
Tell me...

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.540
Even if he did become that monster, 
and destroyed all the Titans...

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.550
Would that really be a victory for humanity?

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:47.810
Eat.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.410
It won't be easy to overcome...

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.850
But I believe we have gained 
a tremendous opportunity

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.880
to ensure the survival of humanity.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:25.760
Compared to when we never even imagined 
that humans could transform into Titans,

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.060
the very fact that we've captured one of 
the enemy is a massive step forward.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.210
Yes, they are out there.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:35.690
And we'll track them all down.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.550
All the Titans within the walls.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.030
Now it is our turn to attack!

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.980
The summons for Eren Jaeger and the 
Survey Corps were suspended indefinitely.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.290
The custody of Annie Leonhart was 
granted to the Survey Corps,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.760
who kept her deep underground.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.510
However,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.440
it would still take

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.660
much sacrifice and time 
before humanity learned

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.980
what it was that held them captive...
