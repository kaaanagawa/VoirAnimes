WEBVTT

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.230
You... cowards!

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.330
Just shut up!

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.310
And bet everything you have on me!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.640
What you need is to be trained 
like a dog, not a man.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.120
Then my decision is made.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.030
The Survey Corps gained custody of Eren.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.790
They now prepare for the expedition beyond the walls.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.980
Special Ops Squad 
Night Before the Counteroffensive (2)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.190
Trost

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.350
Former Survey Corps Headquarters

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.350
The old Survey Corps HQ...

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.290
Originally, it was an old castle we remodeled.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.910
So it certainly looks imposing.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.120
But being so far from the rivers and walls,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.990
it ended up being useless for the Survey Corps.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.200
It was established right after
 the Survey Corps's formation,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.920
when ideals were all they had.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.510
But I never imagined that this 
giant ornament would end up

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.930
being the perfect place to hide you.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.720
Don't get cocky, new kid.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.480
Sir?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.400
I don't care if you're a Titan.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.530
I can't believe Captain Levi will spend 
all his time with a brat like you...

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.160
It's no wonder you bit your tongue, 
talking up a storm while riding a horse!

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.080
First impressions are important.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.210
The new kid almost pissed his pants.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.010
I think he was just surprised 
by how dumb you are.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.600
Either way, my plan worked.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.640
You didn't always talk like that, did you?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.600
If...

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.860
If you're seriously doing it to imitate 
Captain Levi, please stop.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.150
You aren't like him in the slightest.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.030
Trying to bind my hands, Petra?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.160
You haven't followed all the 
necessary steps to become my wife.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.240
I wish you'd bitten through 
your tongue and died.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.410
Going on and on about how 
many Titans you've killed...

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.790
Don't worry.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.970
I bragged about the rest of you, too.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.380
Those are the members of the 
Survey Corps Special Operations Squad.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.380
Also known as Squad Levi.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.590
You're pathetic!

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.180
Petra Rall.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.300
Titan kills, ten.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.430
Assists, forty-eight.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.270
Oluo Bozad.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.830
Kills, thirty-nine.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.190
Assists, nine.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.900
By any definition, they're the best.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.950
Eldo Jinn.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.310
Kills, fourteen.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.000
Assists, thirty-two.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.200
Gunther Schultz.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.470
Kills, seven.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.200
Assists, forty.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.110
They're the best of the Survey Corps,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.020
specially selected by Captain Levi.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.840
And...

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.340
If I lose control, they'll be the ones who kill me.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.180
Look at all these weeds.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.380
What a mess.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.640
It hasn't been used for years.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.930
Inside, it's probably covered in dust.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.060
That's a serious problem.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.870
We'll begin immediately.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.430
I've finished cleaning the upper floor.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.670
Where should I sleep?

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.130
You sleep in the basement.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.000
In the basement again?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.220
Of course.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.340
You can't control yourself.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.140
If you're underground,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.180
we can contain you if you turn 
into a Titan while half-asleep.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.400
That was one of the conditions of your coming here.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.130
It's a rule you'll have to follow.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.230
I'll inspect the rooms.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.860
Eren, take over here.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.700
Yes, sir.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.700
You look disappointed, Eren.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.870
Excuse me?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.010
Ah, I'll just call you Eren... 
Like Captain Levi does.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.460
Here, he sets all the rules.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.880
Sure, I don't mind...

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.010
But did I really look so disappointed?

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.720
Your reaction isn't all that uncommon.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.050
He isn't the perfect hero 
that people say, right?

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.160
The real Captain Levi

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.970
is smaller, more high-strung,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.650
and more violent than people 
think—an intimidating man.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.550
No, what surprised me was how

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.620
closely he seemed to follow orders from above.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.880
Because he's powerful and influential,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.560
you assumed he wouldn't let 
formalities hold him back?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.870
Yes.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.450
I thought he wouldn't take orders from anyone.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.430
I don't know the details,

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.260
but before, he may have 
been just like you said.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.670
Before he joined the Survey Corps,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.500
he was a famous thug, operating 
in the capital's underground.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.270
Why would someone like that...

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.900
I don't know.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.150
I'm not sure what happened,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.970
but I heard Captain Erwin brought 
him into the Survey Corps.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.270
Captain Erwin?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.530
Hey, Eren...

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.880
Y-Yes, sir!

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.030
That isn't nearly good enough.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.890
Redo the whole thing.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.790
Then, in thirty days, we're going beyond 
the walls to set up resupply points?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.920
And we're to bring along new recruits 
from this year's graduates, too.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.550
If there will be any new recruits, that is.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.010
Regardless, I believe it's too soon.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.400
Eren's present circumstance 
is only a temporary measure.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.980
We must demonstrate to the Center

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.770
that he's a benefit to 
humanity as soon as possible.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.320
Otherwise,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.700
we'll have the Military Police after us aga—

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.610
You're even using that story on me, Erwin?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.120
You're as sharp as ever, Mike.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.040
But not as sharp as you.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.200
I'll tell you when the time comes.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.720
We'll be on standby for a few more days.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.440
I heard we're already planning a large-scale 
expedition beyond the walls in a month.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.690
Not to mention, we'll be bringing 
this year's graduates along, too.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.870
Is that true, Eldo?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.650
That's pretty sudden.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.910
That Titan attack must've taken 
a toll on the new troops.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.700
It probably terrified the brats.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.120
Is that true, Captain?

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.300
Making plans isn't my job.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.910
But knowing Erwin,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.630
he has more on his mind 
than we could imagine.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.680
It's true that the situation has changed.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.830
I'd thought that all of our sacrifice 
thus far to lay a route to retake Maria

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.330
had been negated by a single blow.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.390
But now we have an entirely different hope.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.100
I still can't believe it.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.190
But what do they mean when

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.370
they say you turn into a Titan, Eren?

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.610
I don't really remember what happened.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.850
I was so desperate, I couldn't think...

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.380
But the trigger is self-inflicted injury.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.250
I take my hand like this...

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.280
Wait... How do I know this?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.650
You know we won't get anything

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.100
out of Eren that isn't already 
covered in the reports.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.540
But I'm sure a certain 
someone has other ideas.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.780
Maybe fiddle around with you, 
and even kill you, Eren.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.630
Someone?

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.080
Hello, Levi Squad...

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.980
How are you enjoying the castle?

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.220
You're early.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.580
I couldn't wait any longer!

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.500
Squad Leader Hanji?

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.130
Hey there, Eren...

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.060
I'm in charge of investigating the 
two Titans we've captured in town,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.100
and I'd like you to help with 
tomorrow's experiments.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.310
I came to get permission.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.480
Experiments?

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.290
What would I be doing?

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.730
Something totally awesome!

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.790
W-Well...

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.280
I can't give permission for myself.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.240
I don't have that authority...

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.410
Levi, what's Eren doing tomorrow?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.330
Cleaning the courtyard.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.620
Okay, then!

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.790
It's settled!

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.920
Eren... See you tomorrow!

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.120
R-Right...

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.050
But what do you mean by 
experiments with Titans?

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:00.080
Hmm?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.930
U-Um, what kind of experiments...

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.850
Hey, stop... Don't ask!

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.680
I knew it.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.230
I thought you looked like 
you wanted to hear...

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.910
If you really want to hear about it...

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.580
That's just fine.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.540
I'll have to tell you...

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.270
About the boys we captured.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.010
Wallists (1) 
Members of a religious organization that 
proselytizes within the walls. They worship 
the walls as God, refusing to allow any 
changes to them, even for defensive purposes.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.010
Wallists (2) 
Since Wall Maria's fall, their numbers have 
rapidly increased, as has their influence.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.770
We started by repeating the experiments

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.900
from the last five successful captures.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360
Hi, there!

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.710
First, we tested if 
communication was possible.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.450
How are you doing?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.370
What's your name?

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.740
Does that hurt?

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.510
Sir, you're too close!

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.000
Hi, there.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.290
Nice weather we're having.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.000
Hungry?

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.280
That was close!

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.240
Too close!

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.200
Sir, it's too dangerous!

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.030
Unfortunately, we reached the 
same conclusion as before,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.220
that communication was impossible.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.770
But my time with the Titans

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.000
has been so fulfilling 
that I could almost

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.990

forget the weariness from my daily toils.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:45.160
Once upon a time, there was 
a tribe that ate humans.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.870
I'm not talking about you Titans.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.750
I'm talking about a human tribe.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.870
They hid in a cave, 
deep in the mountains,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.250
and attacked travelers on the road,

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.840
stealing their valuables 
and eating their flesh.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.770
The Squad Leader's started the 
usual naming ceremony again.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.410
Yeah, what was it last time?

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.390
Chikachironi and Albert.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.090
For twenty-five years, 
they kept this up.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.400
They say that there were more than 
five hundred victims in all.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.280
That's probably even more than 
the number of humans you've eaten.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.160
And they tried preparing them 
in a number of ways.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.660
They made steaks out of butts.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:37.170
Cut thighs into chunks for stew.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.030
They would chop up, knead, and bake 
the tougher flesh as mincemeat.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.800
They made sausage of 
the blood and organs.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.280
Yes, they were capable of cooking.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.060
That's one difference from you.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.200
But that tribe of cannibals was 
captured after a single mistake,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.580
then executed.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.650
Just like you two.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.680
You made the mistake 
of attacking humanity,

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.450
and you were captured.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:14.960
And so, I'd like to give you the names 
of the male head of that tribe.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.950
You're Sawney.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.290
You're Bean.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.650
But don't worry...

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.800
I won't have you executed.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.720
Nice to meet you, Sawney.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.640
And you, Bean.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.850
Let's all be friends.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.380
And so, I named the seven-meter class Bean,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.800
and the four-meter class Sawney.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.900
Next, we tried cutting 
them off from sunlight.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.870
We know that Titans start shutting 
down as the night progresses.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.490
So we wanted to experiment to verify

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.870
that sunlight was powering them somehow.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.030
There were large individual differences 
as to how they were affected.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.630
You did well, Sawney.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:07.950
Goodnight.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.130
See you tomorrow.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.880
After losing access to sunlight, 
Sawney started slowing down in an hour...

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.140
You really like to stay up late, Bean.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.150
That's fine... I'll stay up with you.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.170
But Bean was fine for three hours.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.660
I was amazed yet again.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.560
They don't eat or drink.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.640
They have vocal organs, 
but they don't need to breathe.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.380
For energy, all they require is sunlight.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.850
What if we deprived them of it 
for an extended period?

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.980
I am curious, but it wouldn't 
do to have them die on us.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.740
We killed the last boys 
we caught by mistake...

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.470
When we experimented with 
cutting off their heads,

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.560
we took off the backs of their necks, too.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.470
Chikachironi and Albert 
were their names.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.440
Their smiles were so cute.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.500
I feel really bad about 
what we did to them.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.830
I never want to feel that way again!

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.700
Hanji-san...

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:25.460
And then, we started touching 
their bodies directly,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.550
to test their sense of pain!

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.390
Sir, you don't need to scream, too!

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.370
How can I not?!

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.640
Look at how much Bean is suffering...

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.650
Bean, stay strong!

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.860
Endure it!

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.860
We had to see if Titans 
had any vulnerabilities

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.030
beyond the backs of their necks.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.010
It was an extremely difficult task...

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.660
Sawney...

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.000
Look, it's gone right into your heart.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.240
Doesn't it hurt?

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:06.790
How does it feel?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.910
Unlike Bean, Sawney was introverted, 
and rarely responded.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.050
What?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.260
What's wrong?

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:23.260
Sir, get back!

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.870
That was really close, Sawney...

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.150
At this rate, you'll really die!

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.550
So Sawney isn't good with self-expression.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.410
He just kept trying to bite my head off.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.160
Uh, Hanji-san?

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:45.540
How can you stay so 
cheerful around Titans?

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.020
I mean,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.010
they've almost wiped us out... 
They're our natural predators.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.010
And you've seen what they 
can do hundreds of times.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.390
You're right.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.020
I've seen many, many friends get 
killed by Titans right in front of me.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:12.200
When I first joined the Survey Corps, 
it was hatred that drove me...

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.030
But then, one day I realized it.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.410
It was after I'd kicked away the 
head of a three-meter Titan.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.450
It was light... Extremely light.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.210
The Titan's body...

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.060
Something that size shouldn't 
even be able to stand,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.550
much less walk, on two feet.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.060
That's true of all of them.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.030
I once cut off an arm,

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:44.930
and it didn't weigh nearly 
what it should have.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.430
I'm told when you became a Titan,

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.560
the body appeared out of thin air.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.260
I believe that

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.810
the Titans we see and the 
Titans of actuality might

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.230
be different things altogether.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:12.280
For decades, we've tried to fight the 
Titans with hatred in our hearts.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.170
I want to try and see them from a 
different angle than the current norm.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.510
It may end up not meaning a thing.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.320
But I'm going to do it anyway!

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.640
Since I joined the Survey Corps, 
it's been one surprise after the next.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.940
Not just Hanji-san...

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.990
Everyone here is odd.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.460
It's like a den of madmen...

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.290
However...

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.950
The Survey Corps is a group of 
people who desire change!

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.000
Hanji-san...

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.760
Could you tell me more 
about your experiments?

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.470
Really?

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.260
Yes!

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.810
I think it's best for tomorrow's 
experiments if I know the details.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.060
Th-That's true...

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.540
Yeah.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.730
There is a lot of stuff I skipped...

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.520
I'll give you more details.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.630
But it'll take a while.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.530
That's fine!

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:23.820
When we first captured a Titan, 
this was my hypothesis...

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.540
And thus, we didn't learn anything 
new from these experiments.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.710
You should have learned everything

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.170
I just told you when you were a trainee.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.540
You knew all that, right?

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.340
Yes...

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.050
I knew it all.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:46.300
So let's go over it once more, 
this time adding my own hypotheses.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.350
What?

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.510
Um, I think—

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:49.390
First, the Titans...

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.020
Is Squad Leader Hanji here?

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.300
The test subjects...

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.230
Both Titans were killed!

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.290
Sawney!

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.240
Bean!

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.920
This can't be real...

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.540
Tell me it isn't real!

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.380
Those subjects were very valuable...

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.210
Did one of the soldiers do it?

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.710
Yeah, we don't know who yet.

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.280
They were both killed at the 
same time before dawn.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.720
By the time the watchmen noticed,

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.180
they'd used their Maneuver 
Gear to get away.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.730
So this was a deliberate plan, 
involving two or more people...

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.890
Sawney!

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.430
Look... Squad Leader Hanji's gone nuts.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.800
What is this?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.280
Let's go.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.320
It's up to the Military Police now.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.710
R-Right...

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.050
What do you see?

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.420
What do you think the enemy is?

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.260
I'm sorry to ask something so odd.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:57.490
The hunt for Sawney and Bean's killers begins.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.130
Meanwhile, Mikasa, Armin, and the other
graduates of the 104th Trainee Corps

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.740
grapple with their own thoughts

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.170
as they choose their affiliation.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.050
What Should Be Done 
Night Before the Counteroffensive (3)
