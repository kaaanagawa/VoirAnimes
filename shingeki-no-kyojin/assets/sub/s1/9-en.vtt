00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.510
Over a hundred years ago,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.730
humanity suddenly found itself 
faced with a new predator.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.990
They were far more powerful than humans.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.240
Humanity was immediately pushed 
to the brink of extinction.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.380
The survivors built three walls: 
Maria, Rose, and Sina.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.210
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.970
However...

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.980
Where the Left Arm Went 
The Battle for Trost (5)

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.320
One reason so many soldiers died

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.860
in the Titans' attack on Trost

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.030
was the absence of the elite Survey Corps.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.490
Only that morning,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.370
they had embarked on 
a reconnaissance mission beyond the walls.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.580
They're here!

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.550
The main force of the Survey Corps!

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.010
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.140
Look, it's Captain Levi!

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.810
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.100
Shut up.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.310
If they knew how fussy you are,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.980
they wouldn't look at you 
with such admiration.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.000
The Titans are right outside...

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.950
What kind of Titan will we see this time?

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.790
It'd be so great if we saw an Aberrant!

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.170
We have one right here.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.630
Huh? Where?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.880
Right here.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.480
Forward!

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.640
Survey outlying areas

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.680
and establish supply points 
that would support a human advance.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.810
Being entrusted with these missions, 
the Survey Corps

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.340
receives the best 
humanity has to offer.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.070
The military genius of a select few

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.040
within their ranks has greatly 
boosted their survival rate.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.790
But even so, every excursion into Titan territory

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.190
costs over thirty percent of their troops.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.830
The difference in strength 
between humans and Titans is that great.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.960
Just you wait...

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.840
It won't be long

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.010
before humanity wipes you out!

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.170
We'll be the ones to survive in the end!

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.480
Captain Levi will...

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.400
kill you all!

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.460
One to the right...

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.880
Two to the left.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.920
Captain, I've brought reinforcements.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.630
Petra, tend to the wounded soldiers below.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.880
The rest of you, support the right flank.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.260
I'll take care of the left.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.970
Captain!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.860
It's okay!

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.200
I won't hurt you.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.870
So close!

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.370
Now it's my turn.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.620
There!

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.790
See?

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.210
That didn't hurt, did it?

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.710
You all have...

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.750
the stupidest expressions.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.030
Whoa.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.490
Stay put.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.490
Otherwise, it will get messy...

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.410
when I slice you.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.540
Damn.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.840
Filthy...

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.770
Captain,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.440
the bleeding won't stop...

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.220
Captain...

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.750
What is it?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.760
W-Was I able...

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.790
to help humanity?

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.500
Or will I die,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.800
never having been of any use at all?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.510
You have done a great deal.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.610
And you will continue to do so.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.770
The resolve you leave behind 
will give me strength.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.980
I promise you...

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.400
I will obliterate the Titans!

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.910
Captain...

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.800
He's gone.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.170
Did he hear me to the very end?

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:24.670
Yes.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.720
I'm sure he did.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.170
Look.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.450
He seems so at peace...

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.180
Very well, then.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.220
Levi!

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.730
We're pulling back.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.440
Pulling back?

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.440
We have yet to push ourselves to the limit.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.570
Are my men dying for nothing?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.360
The Titans are heading north, toward town.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.370
Just like five years ago...

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.870
Something is happening in town.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.500
The wall...

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.860
may have fallen.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.960
Damn it!

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.010
Damn it...

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.380
It wasn't...

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.960
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.420
We had changed over the past five years...

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.210
We trained as hard as we could.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.420
We thought long and hard.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.550
It was all to defeat them...

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.180
So that they wouldn't take 
anything else from us.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.970
It's hot.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.350
It's so hot...

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.770
Save me, Mother.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.230
Mother?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.490
Mother...

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.990
Mother?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.120
Save...

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.380
Why did this happen?

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.970
Why do they take everything from us?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.170
Our lives.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.760
Our dreams...

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.010
Why?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.730
Damn it all! Damn it! Damn it!

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.360
I won't give up!

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.490
I'll eliminate them all...

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.650
Every single Titan!

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.510
I'll kill them myself!

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.720
I'll wipe them off the face

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.300
of the earth.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.810
Every single one!

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:16.400
More...

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.320
More...

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.400
Kill more!

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.200
I want to kill...

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.620
Kill...

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.000
more...

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.500
I'll kill them all.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.460
Eren?

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:50.980
Eren!

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.980
Eren, can you move?

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.770
Can you understand what I'm saying?

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.230
Tell them everything you know.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.900
I'm sure they'll understand!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.280
Armin?

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.200
Hear that?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.870
He said, "I'll kill them all!"

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.580
Yes, I heard him.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.120
He's going to devour us.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.560
What are they all talking about?

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.050
Are those blades pointed at us?

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.470
Those blades are for fighting Titans.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.760
Why are they looking at me like that?

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.730
What is this?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.980
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.980
The Survey Corps (1) 
Their primary mission consists of 
reconnoitering outlying areas. 
Their objectives have changed 
following the Fall of Wall Maria.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.990
The Survey Corps (2) 
After the Fall, their new objective is to 
prepare for the second operation to 
recapture Wall Maria by establishing 
supply points and routes for troop movement.


00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.390
Wall Rose Interior

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.410
Trainees, keep your equipment 
at hand, and stand by!

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.420
And then...

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.210
We managed to get some gas, 
and retreat from Trost.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.170
So that's what happened...

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.970
I'm sorry.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.970
I requested supplies 
for everyone many times, but...

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.670
And we finally managed 
to get some gas, too.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.900
Th-Then does that mean that 
everyone who isn't here...

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.480
Yeah.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.860
Even Mikasa?

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.530
N-No...

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.300
I thought Mikasa came back 
later with Jean and the rest.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.160
Jean, don't tell me Mikasa was injured.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.250
Hey, what's wrong?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.280
We've been ordered to keep it a secret.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.840
I can't discuss it.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.880
Keep it a secret?

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.010
What?

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.100
Of course, it won't stay secret for long...

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.610
Before long, all humanity 
will know about it.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.620
Assuming humanity lasts that long....

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.650
A fortification of flesh, made from Titans.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.490
The engineers are pretty smart.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.410
But we can't lower our guard.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.960
We stand at the front lines of the war 
between humanity and the Titans...

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.790
at the precipice.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.420
What's wrong?

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.460
Nothing.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.340
It won't interfere with the mission.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.890
But I'm worried about my 
friends in the vanguard.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.430
The messenger I just saw on 
his way to HQ looked pale.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.350
Yeah,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.980
but we simply need to fend off 
the Titans, just as we trained.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:44.520
Captain Hannes, I heard that the three 
children who escaped with you

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.150
five years ago are trainees now.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.950
Were they in the vanguard?

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:50.530
Yes.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.120
I'm sorry.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.830
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.700
They're safe.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.500
They're tough.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.290
Each possesses a means of survival.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.800
One excels in combat.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.760
One has formidable resolve.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.430
And one has a brilliant mind.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.140
They're safe.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.720
I know they've survived.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.390
Trainee Jaeger!

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.730
As well as Trainees Ackerman and Arlert...

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.400
What you're doing right now 
is an act of treason!

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.730
We may decide to kill you on the spot!

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.990
If you attempt to lie to us, 
or make a single move,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.490
we will fire an HE Projectile at you immediately.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.290
We will not hesitate!

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.750
Huh?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.290
Answer me at once!

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.790
What are you?!

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.290
Are you a man? Or a Titan?

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.340
What kind of question is that?

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.090
Why look at me like that?

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.100
Looking at me 
as if I'm a monster...

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.100
Is that what they think I am?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.100
I d-don't understand the question!

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.020
He's pretending to know nothing?

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.230
Monster!

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.990
Try that again, and I'll blow you to pieces.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.150
It just takes an instant!

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.620
You won't have time to reveal your true form!

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.120
True form?

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.620
Plenty of people saw you,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.420
as you emerged from within a Titan!

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:31.130
Humanity has permitted an unknown 
creature like you to infiltrate Wall Rose!

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.300
Even if you are trainees 
given to us by the King,

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.140
the safest course is to 
eliminate the risk immediately!

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.640
My thinking is correct!

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.500
The Armored Titan that destroyed Wall 
Maria could appear at any minute.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.240
Right now, humanity is at risk of annihilation!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.700
Do you understand?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.370
We can't waste more time or troops on you!

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.750
I will fire an HE Projectile 
at you without hesitation!

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:09.130
It's true that they aren't being cooperative.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.670
We aren't likely to get 
any useful information out of them.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.890
You're right, Sir. 
We're wasting time and troops.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.640
Captain, this is our chance!

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.060
If we dismember him while he 
pretends to be human...

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.520
My specialty is

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.020
tearing through flesh.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.240
If necessary, I am willing to 
demonstrate at any time.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.410
If anyone would like to experience it firsthand,

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.780
I invite them to be the first to approach.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:47.930
Captain, Mikasa Ackerman was 
in the rearguard with us.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.130
She is worth a hundred other soldiers.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.090
Her loss would be a critical blow to humanity.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.230
Hey...

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.390
Mikasa... Armin! 
What's going on here?

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.100
Mikasa!

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.310
You can't fight another human!

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.980
Where could we run 
within these cramped walls?

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.770
It doesn't matter who I must fight.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.310
I won't let anyone kill Eren.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.780
I don't need any other reason.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.240
Let's talk this through!

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.240
No one knows what's going on,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.750
so they're ruled by fear!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.250
Am I the only one who thinks I'm not a Titan?

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.710
Damn it.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.790
I don't remember how I got here!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.290
I'm too exhausted to move,

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:33.960
and if I say anything, they'll probably kill me.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.800
Killed by a human?

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.340
That's ridiculous!

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.140
What is this about, anyway?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.230
I came out of a Titan?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.230
What are they talking about?! 
What the hell is going on?!

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.730
Wasn't that a dream?

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.030
If it wasn't...

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.820
Then my arm regrew where 
my clothes are missing...

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.370
That'd make me just like a Titan!

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.490
That's impossible...

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.290
Why would I...

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:07.960
Why?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.370
I'll ask you once more!

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.880
What are you?!

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.300
I can't screw up my answer...

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.430
I wouldn't be the only one to die.

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.550
That's right.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.010
I've always been

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.280
just like everyone else...

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.100
A human!

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.240
I see...

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:44.620
Then don't hate me for this.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.250
There's no avoiding it.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.580
No one can prove

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.500
that they are not the devil.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.090
Eren! Armin!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.890
We're going up!

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.050
Stop!

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.890
Eren...

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.730
When I get back,

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.530
I'll show you what I've kept secret 
in the basement all this time.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.710
Never let go of this key.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.620
And every time you see it,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.670
remember that you must 
go to the basement!

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.680
This shot will impair your memory.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.760
That's why I can't explain now...

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.400
Listen to me.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.640
Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.670
This power will help you then!

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.480
Their memories will tell you how to use it.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.280
Eren!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.830
If you get to the basement someday, 
you'll learn the truth...

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.900
The path will be harsh and cruel, 
but you must make it there!

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.590
If you want to save Mikasa, 
Armin, and everyone else,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.470
you must master this power!

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.620
Did we get him?

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.490
No...

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.330
"Eren is not an enemy of humanity."

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:59.520
Armin puts his life on the line 
to plead for Eren.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.790
However, consumed by terror, 
the Garrison is incapable of rational thought

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.060
and orders Eren's execution.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:26:34.720
