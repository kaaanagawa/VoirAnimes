00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.230
Attention!

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.770
I shall now explain the 
plan to retake Trost.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.170
Let me introduce you to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.480
Eren Jaeger, from the Trainee Corps.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580
He is the result of a top-secret project

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.330
to turn humans into Titans.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.010
He will become a Titan,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.120
pick up the giant boulder 
 by the shattered gate,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.840
carry it over, and seal the hole.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.470
Your job will be

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.850
to protect him from Titans 
while he moves the boulder!

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.350
When this mission succeeds,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.190
humanity will have retaken 
its territory from them

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.310
for the very first time.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.900
Compared to all that humanity has lost, 
it may seem insignificant.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.700
But for humanity,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.130
that step will be a great advance in

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.080
our attack on the Titans!

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.220
Eren, don't you know who I am?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.590
It's me, Mikasa!

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.770
Your family!

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.780
Move, Ackerman!

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.250
What the?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.860
He's just like any other stupid Titan!

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.450
I'm changing the plan.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.910
We protect Jaeger from the Titans 
until we can retrieve him.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.220
He's still valuable as one 
of humanity's last hopes.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.770
We cannot just abandon him like this.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.830
Where am I?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.070
I'm at home?

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.220
Jean!

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.080
Why isn't he using his Maneuver Gear?

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.170
No way... Is it broken?

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.310
I'll come up with something!

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.220
Mikasa!

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.190
What happened to the plan?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710
It failed.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.650
Everyone's fighting because 
we can't leave Eren.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.200
But there are too many...

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.820
Before long, they'll wipe us out.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.960
The spot on the back of the neck,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.730
ten centimeters across and a meter high.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.550
Eren... Answer me!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.560
You knew that hell was one 
step beyond the walls.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.180
So why did you want to go?

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.190
Why?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.610
Because I was born into this world!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.950
Eren!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.010
Primal Desires 
The Battle for Trost (9)

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.060
Damn it...

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.420
Why am I the one slowing us down?

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.710
Can I really come up with something?

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.540
Captain, we're finished!

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.430
We're the last ones left!

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.800
Fall back to the boulder!

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.790
What's the situation?

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.920
Five Titans,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.940
coming from the gate.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.200
I can't wait till they're gone! No way!

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.450
Jean!

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.660
His Maneuver Gear really is busted.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.500
What's wrong?

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.530
Crap...

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.830
What's wrong with it?

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.210
Damn it...

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.300
Not now!

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.390
Jean, calm down!

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.430
Marco?

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.680
What are you doing?

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.740
Jeez.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.850
Don't be such a pain in the ass!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.630
Damn, why is the trigger 
so hard to pull?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.180
Jean!

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.890
What are you doing?!

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.600
Look who's talking?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.730
Hurry and get out of here!

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.150
You're insane!

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.460
You're the crazy one!

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.100
Can't believe I survived that...

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.390
Look at that.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.550
Eren...

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.360
Mikasa!

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.020
Armin!

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.600
Eren won!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.730
Now he's trying to get the job done!

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:32.360
If we can cover him till 
he gets to the gate,

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.990
we win!

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.760
Defend him at all costs!

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.100
Protect Eren until he reaches the gate, 
even if it costs you your life!

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.710
Don't let any of the Titans near him!

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.550
Don't let them interfere!

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.800
Protect Eren!

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.010
You two, head toward Eren.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:00.760
That's an order!

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.730
Got it?

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.350
Roger!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.690
Mitabi's squad...

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.190
What are they doing?

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.090
The Titans won't follow us!

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.990
We have to get closer to them 
until they attack us!

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.600
Look over here, bastards!

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.890
If you don't, I'll jab my blade 
up your stinking ass!

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.750
Here they come!

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.040
Two of them are coming!

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.240
Run!

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.840
Run to the building!

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.540
What the...

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.090
Going on the ground is suicide.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.300
Without horses or buildings, 
they can't fight!

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.910
No... Now, it's the only way left...

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.020
Follow Mitabi's squad!

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.810
Armin, let's go, too.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.210
This way! Over here!

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.880
My body feels like it's being crushed...

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.440
Mikasa? Armin?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.070
What are you doing?

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.650
If you stay down there, 
Titans will get you!

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.140
Come on, you slowpokes!

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.800
Over here!

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.990
H-Hey!

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.950
Mitabi!

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.080
So why did you want to go to 
the world beyond the walls?

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.680
From the time we are born,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.460
we are free...

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.130
It doesn't matter how strong

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.510
those who would deny 
us that freedom are...

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.160
Flaming water... Frozen earth... 
I don't care what it is!

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.740
The one who sees them

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.900
will be the freest person in the world!

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.230
Fight...

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.110
I'd willingly give my life for that!

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.040
It doesn't matter how 
terrifying the world is.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.750
It doesn't matter how 
cruel the world is!

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.050
Fight...

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.300
Fight!

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.380
Fight!

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.640
Fight!

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.960
Another Titan?

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.480
I'll handle it.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.880
Out of the way!

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.090
Go, Eren!

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.890
Fight!

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.080
Everyone...

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.840
You didn't die in vain...

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.720
Today, for the first time, humanity 
has defeated the Titans!

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.470
Yellow smoke round sighted.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.980
The operation has succeeded!

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.480
Send more reinforcements!

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.590
Evac the elite team!

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.990
History of the War Against the Titans (1) 
The oldest available records say 
the Titans appeared 107 years ago. 
They devoured most of humanity.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.990
History of the War Against the Titans (2) 
Humanity retaliated with cannons, 
but they were useless in the face 
of the Titan's regenerative ability.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.600
The rest of the Titans are coming!

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.590
Get up the walls!

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.510
We'll evacuate after we get Eren.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.550
Armin?

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.380
How's Eren?

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.220
He's so hot, I can barely believe it!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.010
We need to hurry up the walls...

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.110
Part of his body is 
fusing with the Titan.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.730
I can't pull him out!

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.980
We'll have to cut him out.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.250
Wait!

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.410
Eren...

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:19.260
Armin!

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.840
Mikasa?

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.230
That's...

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.160
Wings of freedom...

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.820
Hey, brats.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.750
What's going on here?

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.130
Afterwards, the sudden arrival and 
assistance of the Survey Corps,

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.110
along with the efforts of 
the Garrison's engineers,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.350
allowed Wall Rose to withstand 
the Titans once more.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.190
It took a full day to eradicate the remaining 
Titans now trapped within Trost.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.660
The barrage of fixed canon fire 
from atop the walls was endless.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.290
HE rounds killed most of the 
Titans swarming the walls.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:45.130
The few surviving Titans were 
primarily killed by the Survey Corps.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.070
During that operation, humanity managed

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.980
to take one 4-meter class and 
one 7-meter class alive.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.120
However,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:04.020
207 were dead or missing, 
and 897 were wounded.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.030
Humanity had indeed scored its 
first victory against the Titans,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.650
but there were too many casualties 
for anyone to celebrate.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.140
Hey...

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.520
You're...

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.020
Marco...?

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.400
Trainee,

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.860
do you know his name?

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.160
I knew I hadn't seen him around...

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.790
But this couldn't have 
happened to him...

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:01.750
Marco,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.880
what happened?

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.960
D-Did anyone...

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.530
Did anyone see how he died?

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.880
What's his name?

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:13.720
If you know, tell me now.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.930
Do you understand, trainee?

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.270
It's already been two days 
since the hole was sealed.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.780
And we still haven't finished 
collecting the bodies.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.520
At this rate, there 
could be an epidemic.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.030
We must avert a second tragedy.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.530
There isn't time to 
mourn your friend yet.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.280
Understand?

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.710
104th Trainee Corps.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.750
Captain of Squad 19, Marco Bott.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.840
Marco, then?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.340
I'm glad we have a name.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.630
Let's get back to work.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.760
What is this?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.490
Where a Titan threw up.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.780
They don't have digestive organs.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.180
So after they've eaten all they can, 
they throw up like that...

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.220
That's so...

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.170
Damn...

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.790
There's no way to identify anyone in this!

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.590
I'm sorry...

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.520
I'm sorry.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.500
Apologizing won't help.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.560
Just mourn his passing.

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.210
Any questions?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.230
The leader of the Survey Corps 
strike force, Commander Erwin.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.990
And Captain Levi...

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.100
U-Um...

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.220
Where

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.680
am I?

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.940
As you can see, it's an 
underground jail cell.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.070
The Military Police has 
retained custody of you.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.280
We only recently received permission

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.700
to speak with you.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.040
That key...

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.040
Yes.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.610
It's yours.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.790
You can have it back later.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.340
The basement of your house

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.970
in Zhiganshina, Doctor Jaeger's house,
 holds the answer

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:02.550
to the mystery of the Titans.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.640
Is that it?

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.460
Yes...

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.550
I think so.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.620
That's what my father said.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.190
You have amnesia, and 
your dad's missing.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.730
Pretty convenient.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.230
Levi.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.380
We already reached the conclusion 
that he has no reason to lie.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.350
There's still so much we don't know.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.740
But right now, we need to 
ask what you want to do.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.100
What I want to do?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.490
To get to your house,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.560
we must retake Zhiganshina 
and Wall Maria.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.350
The simplest and easiest way 
to seal the shattered gate

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.150
would be to use your Titan power.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.020
It's likely that Titans 
will determine our fate.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.350
The Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.650
are the same, in principle, as you.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.610
Your decision is the key.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.120
The key that can save 
humanity from despair.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:09.950
I...

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.290
I am?

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.670
I'll kill them all!

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:23.300
I'll wipe every last Titan 
off the face of this Earth!

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.760
Answer up, you piece of crap.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.350
What do you want to do?

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600
I want to join the Survey Corps

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.770
and just slaughter the Titans!

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.530
Oh?

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.070
Not bad.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:50.280
Erwin,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.500
I'll take responsibility for him.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.070
Convey that to the brass.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.490
It isn't that I trust him.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.660
If he betrays us or loses control, 
I'll kill him on the spot.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.440
They shouldn't complain.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.970
Because only I can do it.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.990
I accept your request.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.180
You can join the Survey Corps.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.280
A promise held high.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.200
A hope trampled.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:59.710
A rage festering deep within.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:04.590
In a confused haze, 
Eren hallucinates about

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.370
all that has happened since that day.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.550
Since That Day
