00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.990
A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair 
Humanity Rises Again (1)

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.070
You there!

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.910
Yes, sir!

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.910
Who are you?

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.870
Armin Arlert, from Zhiganshina!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.250
Yeah? That's a stupid name.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.420
Your parents give you that?

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.170
My grandfather!

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.000
Arlert, what are you doing here?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.130
Trying to aid humanity's victory!

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.970
That is indeed wonderful...

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.930
Then you will feed the Titans.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.010
Row 3, about face!

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.890
Who are you?

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.850
Thomas Wagner, from Trost!

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.140
I can't hear you!

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.440
Thomas Wagner, from—

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.770 line:20%
Too soft! Go practice in the cattle shed!

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.730
There he goes...

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.110
When you were a trainee,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.070 line:20%
You, next!

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.820
your first day was just the same.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.190 line:20%
Mina Karolina, from Karanes!

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.190
It brings back memories.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.400
Wrong!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.610
You are from the pig shed, worth less than cattle.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.830
Yes, sir! I am less than cattle!

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.830 line:20%
No, you're a fly, swarming around a pig's ass!

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.040
What's the point of screaming at them?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.500
It's a rite of passage.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.580 line:20%
Yes, sir!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.790
We force them to abandon who they are,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.370 line:20%
Next!

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 line:20%
Samuel Linke-Jackson, from Snate Village!

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.130
then raise them from nothing as pure soldiers.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.380 line:20%
A horrible name! Change it now!

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.300 line:20%
What are you doing here?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.300
It is a necessary process.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.300
Sacrificing myself for humanity!

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.050
Row 4, about face!

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.260
It seems not all of them are 
being subjected to that process.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.930 line:20%
Listen up! I've seen a lot of shit in my time,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.220
There is no need for those who have 
already undergone the rite of passage.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.980 line:20%
but you are the sorriest pieces 
of shit I've ever seen.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.140
If I were to guess,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.060 line:20%
You're in for three years of hell!

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.650
they probably lived through hell two years ago.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.060
You can see it in their eyes.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.570
Now, let's go.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.240
Who are you?!

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.700
Jean Kirschstein, from Trost!

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.820
What are you doing here?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.040
Joining the Military Police, 
for a life deep within the walls.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.710
Oh, I see...

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.710
You want access to the Interior?

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.540
Yes.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.250
Who said you could sit down?!

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.340
Anyone who can't handle this

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.260
will never make the Military Police!

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.970
Who are you? 
What are you doing here?

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.260
Marco Bott, Jinae City, Wall Rose South District!

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.680
I want to join the Military Police,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.930
to offer the King my body and self in service!

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.060
Really...

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.610
I'm glad to hear that.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.020
Good luck.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.320
However...

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.660
The King doesn't want your body.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.030
Next! You!

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.330
Who are you?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.330
Connie Springer, of Ragako Village, 
Wall Rose South District!

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.830
You're doing it wrong, Connie Springer...

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.250
I explained that this salute demonstrates

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.760
your resolve to devote your 
entire heart to the people.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.180
Is your heart on your right side?

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.400
Hey, you...

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.110
What are you doing?

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.490
You're the one I'm talking to! You!

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.870
Who are you?!

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.330
Sasha Blause, from Dauper village, 
Wall Rose South District!

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.330
Sasha Blause,

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.290
what are you holding in your right hand?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.750
A boiled potato!

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.260
The kitchen had a fresh batch, and I couldn't resist.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.300
Did you steal it?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.550
Why?

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.760
Why would you choose to eat a potato now?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.180
Letting it get cold would've been a waste,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.730
so I decided I should eat it now.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.270
Well, I still don't understand...

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.990
Why would you eat that potato?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.200
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.550
You can have half...

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.050
Half...

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.560
He's still making that potato girl run.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.770
Wow, five straight hours?

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.530
But she seemed more distraught 
when told she wouldn't get dinner

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.490
than when told she must run until she dropped.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.620
If I remember correctly,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.200
Dauper Village is a tiny hunting 
village, deep in the mountains.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.000
What's that?

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.080
The dropouts.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.500
They requested a transfer, to the frontier.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.710
What? But it's only the first day.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.340
It was only a matter of time.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.340
If you aren't strong enough, 
you have to leave.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.890
Hard to believe they'd rather go back 
to weeding and picking up rocks.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.390
Hey, he didn't ask where 
you were from, did he?

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.350
Zhiganshina, the same as him.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.650
I see... That's...

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.730
Then, weren't you there that day?

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.900
H-Hey...

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.320
Did you see the Colossal Titan?

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.530
Y-Yeah...

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.040
I already told you I saw it.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.420
Really?

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.830
How big was it?

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.170
Big enough to look over the walls.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.170
What? I heard it stepped right over them.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.300
Me, too!

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.800
That's what they said in my village.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.930
No, it wasn't that tall.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.390
What did it look like?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.560
It barely had any skin, 
but it had a huge mouth.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.560
What about the Armored Titan 
that broke Wall Maria?

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.440
They call it that,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.360
but it looked like a normal Titan to me.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.860
Th-Then what's a normal Titan like?

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.620
Guys, let's stop with the questions.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.870
I'm sure he'd prefer to forget some things.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.960
I'm sorry for asking—

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.670
Don't be!

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.590
The Titans aren't all that tough...

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.640
If we can master 
the Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.430
they won't stand a chance!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.480
Finally, I'm able to train as a soldier...

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.270
I was just so excited, I forgot myself for a second.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.730
I'm joining the Survey Corps, so I can 
wipe the Titans off the face of this earth.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.570
I'll kill them all—

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.070
Hey, are you nuts?

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.530
Did you just say you want 
to join the Survey Corps?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.620
Yeah, I did.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.500
And you said you wanted to join the 
Military Police to take it easy, right?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.380
I'm no liar...

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:10.090
I'm a straight talker, unlike someone 
who pretends to have balls of steel,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.010
even when he's about to piss himself.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.180
Are you talking about me?

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.680
D-Don't...

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.720
Hey, I didn't...

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.530
Well, I'm sorry.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.660
I didn't want to say you're 
doing the wrong thing.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.740
Peace?

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.740
Yeah.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.760
I'm sorry, too.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.470
Hey, you...

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.810
W-W-Well, uh...

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.770
It's just that you look 
different than the rest of us.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.610
I'm s-sorry...

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.770
Your hair is very pretty.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.320
Thank you.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.580
I'm fine, leave me alone.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.460
You're always so impulsive when you're riled up.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.460
This again?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.300
Anyway, isn't your hair a little long?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.880
It could cause an accident when you're 
practicing with the Maneuver Gear.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.550
Very well.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.470
I'll cut it.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.060
But how short should it be?

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.730
H-Hey!

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.810
That's my shirt!

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.570
What did you wipe on my shirt?

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.030
My trust.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.870
Finally done...

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.220
This is...

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.220
Bread!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.190
That's all I could get, but I saved it for you...

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.070
But you should drink some water first.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.350
Are you god?!

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.030
God!

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.370
Hey, what are you two doing?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.740
Um, she spent the whole day running...

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.790
So you're trying to do a good deed?

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.970
Did you do that for the potato girl?

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.560
Was the effort worth what you got out of it?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.600
Well, it doesn't matter...

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.650
Anyway, I'm carrying her to bed.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.610
Are you doing a good deed, too?

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:21.860
I'm doing her a favor so she'll owe me.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.910
I'm looking forward to 
a lot of fun from this idiot.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.750
First, we'll evaluate what you have!

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.790
Anyone unable to do this can't 
even serve as a decoy!

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.250
They will be sent to the frontier.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.250
These involve only the rudimentary basics,

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.760
but even at this stage, you can see their 
potential with the Maneuver Gear.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.850
Look.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.310
She's steady as a rock.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.600
She knows exactly what to do.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.650
That's what I mean by potential.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.650
Looks like we have a lot of talent this year.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.320
Um, what about him?

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.030
That's exactly my point.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.280
You may have the will,

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.620
but not necessarily the talent.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.250
What are you doing, Eren Jaeger?!

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.500
Pick yourself up!

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.420
What is this?

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.510
How am I supposed to do this?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.800
This can't be happening...

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:27.970
Information We Can Share So Far: 
Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (1) 
Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training is 
a difficult process, meant to force the trainee to 
 adapt from moving in a flat 2D plane to a 3D space.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.980
Information We Can Share So Far: 
Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (2) 
High endurance, strong legs, 
good spatial awareness, 
and nerves of steel are requisites.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.940
Stick to the basics, and you should be fine.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.620
Don't worry about doing well.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.150
Watch the balance and stay centered.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.990
Slowly rest your weight on the belts 
attached to your hips and feet.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.330
Stay calm, and you can do it.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.200
I was able to.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.290
Okay, I think I can do it this time!

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.670
Raise me, Armin!

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.100
Hey, Daz...

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.930
Isn't that the kid

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.980
from yesterday who said 
he'd kill all the Titans?

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.690
Well, I bet he'll be off to the frontier tomorrow.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.150
We don't have enough food 
to feed worthless rejects.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.940
Eren...

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.780
There's no point in worrying.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.160
You just have to figure it out tomorrow.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.120
I'm pathetic...

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.250
I'll never be able to kill them all like this.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.500
You should let that idea go.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.670
What?!

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.670
You should give up on being a soldier.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.130
There are other ways to fight than 
by throwing away your life.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.510
Listen here...

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.510
I saw what happened that day!

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.140
You really think you'll convince me this way?

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.650
But it doesn't matter how much you want it.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.360
Why not?

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.820
It isn't your decision whether you 
end up a soldier or not, Eren.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.660
I'm not saying you should return 
to the frontier alone.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:13.620 line:20%
Let's go, Armin.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.040 line:20%
S-Sure.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.790
Don't worry...

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.290
I will go with you.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.220
Um, anyway...

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.600
So, can I take that?

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.240
The trick to staying upright?

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.830
Sorry, but I'm a genius.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.340
All I can say is to feel it.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.080
Actually, I'd like you to tell me...

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.800
How are you still sane, after you 
humiliated yourself like that?

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.840
Guys, I'm begging you here...

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.930
But didn't you say just yesterday

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.760
something like, "People who aren't 
strong enough should leave"?

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.350
Am I wrong?

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.020
Or was it, "If you don't have the 
talent, you have to leave"?

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.640
Which was it?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.810
Please!

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.940
I've heard you two are really good!

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.150
Bertolt... Reiner!

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.600
Sorry, but I can't imagine any 
trick to just hanging there.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.830
I don't think I can give you the 
advice you're looking for.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.580
Okay...

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.790
We'll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.960
You two are from Zhiganshina, aren't you?

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.750
Yes... Why?

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.750
Then you should know how 
terrifying the Titans are.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.470
Why did you decide to be soldiers?

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.970
I'm not like Eren.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.680
I didn't see them at close range.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.350
But when I thought about how the government

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.020
forced people into that insane plan 
to retake Titan territory,

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.860
I had to do something.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.360
I see.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.900
Where are you two from?

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:17.370
Reiner and I come from a small village 
in the mountains of southeast Wall Maria.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.500
But... That means...

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.540
Yeah.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.370
It isn't like the big towns by the rivers...

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.350
The news was slow to reach us.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.510
In fact, the Titans reached us first.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.090
It was dawn...

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.250
The animals were unusually restless,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.010
and we heard a rumbling 
we'd never heard before.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.270
Eventually, as it got louder, 
we realized it was the sound of footsteps.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.940
And when I rushed to open the window...

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.370
Beyond that,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.290
I don't really remember.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.830
Everyone was in a panic.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:04.670
Hey...

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.930
Why are you discussing this now?

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.430
I'm sorry...

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.800
What I meant to say is this:

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.080
you aren't like the others.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.010
The others?

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.720
Those here who don't understand how 
terrifying the Titans really are.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.850
Enough.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:33.320
The vast majority are here 
because they don't want to lose face.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:38.160
Told they'd be admitting they were 
cowards if they chose to be workers

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.600
after turning twelve, 
they became trainees.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.790
But we're not really so different.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.970
We chose this hoping to join the Military Police 
because they're safe, deep in the Interior.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.910
If that doesn't work, we may just give it all up.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.340
I don't have any will of my own...

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.930
There's nothing wrong with valuing your own life.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.900
I just want

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.020
to return to the homeland I lost.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.600
That's all I have left to go on.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.580
I'm going back, no matter what.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.200
You...

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.200
Why did you become a soldier?

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.670
I...

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.010
I decided I had to kill them.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.970
I had to kill all the Titans myself...

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.390
That was what I decided.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:51.440
So even after seeing the Titans, 
you didn't surrender to despair?

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:52.820
No.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.030
Though I don't know if 
I can even become a soldier now.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.630
Review and recheck everything, 
starting with your belt.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.050
Tomorrow will go fine.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.300
You can do it.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.250
Eren Jaeger, was it?

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.680
Yes, thank you.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.440
Reiner Braun, right?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.990
Eren Jaeger, are you ready?

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.080
Yes!

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.200
I'll do this...

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:49.450
I can do this!

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.750
I may not have talent,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.500
but I have more guts than anyone.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.090
Begin!

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.430
I don't know the theory...

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.390
I don't have any evidence.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.690
But this is all I've got!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.400
This is my weapon!

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.110
I did it.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.660
I did it!

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.420
N-Not yet...

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.880
I'm not giving up yet!

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:40.800
Put him down.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.130
I... I...

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.520
Wagner, change belts with Jaeger.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.580
Y-Yes, sir.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.300
Your equipment was defective.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.120
The fitting on your belt was damaged.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.440
I've never heard of this part getting damaged.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.960
I'll have to add it to the maintenance checklist.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.920
So, he managed to stay upright for 
a bit, even with a broken belt?

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.420
Wow...

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.380
Th-Then, did I pass?

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.550
You're fine.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.340
Commence training.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.560
I did it! I really did it!

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.730
Did you see that, Mikasa?

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.680
I can do this!

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.150
I can fight the Titans!

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.990
I don't need you taking care of me anymore!

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.360
I guess it all worked out.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.740
He's looking at us, as if to say, "See!"

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:46.820
No...

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.370
He's relieved because he thinks we 
won't have to be separated now.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.140
Grisha...

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.710
Today, your son

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.960
became a soldier.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.250
Eren graduates from the Trainee Corps,

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.320
and he sees humanity regain its dignity.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.350
"We can defeat the Titans."

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.020
Just as he becomes sure of this,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.250
humanity learns a lesson once again.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.380
Night of the Graduation Ceremony 
Humanity Rises Again (2)
