WEBVTT

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.730
I knew it...

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.440
It's coming!

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.570
The Female Titan!

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.120
The Female Titan emerged once more,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.100
defeating the elite Squad Levi members, 
one after the next.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.510
I will kill it!

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.340
Having decided it was his fault for 
believing in his companions,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.530
Eren transforms and engages 
the Female Titan.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.350
but he suffers defeat, and the 
Female Titan takes him.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.220
Give Eren back!

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.130
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.390
rip her apart,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.800
and get you out of that filth.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.110
I'm sorry, Eren...

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.250
Just wait a little longer...

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.850
Wait!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.770
Wh-What are you...

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.480
Fall back for now.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.960
The Defeated 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (6)

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.530
Maintain this distance.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.810
It may be tired.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930
It does not appear to 
be going very fast.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.160
He seems to have been bitten 
right out of the neck.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.060
Is Eren dead?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.360
He's alive.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.210
The target appears intelligent,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.690
and its goal seems to be capturing Eren.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.330
If it wanted him dead, 
it would've crushed him.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.200
The target is fighting to 
escape after going through

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.910
the trouble of putting him in its mouth.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.540
Its goal may have been to eat Eren.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.040
If that's the case, he's in its stomach.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.750
It's more reasonable to 
assume that he's dead.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.050
He's alive!

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.700
I hope you're right.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.390
If you'd only protected Eren, 
this wouldn't have happened!

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.280
I see...

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.790
You're the one from back then.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.140
Eren's close friend?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.960
We'll limit ourselves to a single goal.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.720
First, give up on killing 
the Female Titan.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.660
It killed many of our comrades!

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.430
As long as it can harden 
its skin, we can't kill it.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.160
Do as I say.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.440
We'll pin our hopes on 
Eren still being alive,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.770
and rescue him before 
it leaves the forest.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.800
I will tear away at it...

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.550
You draw its attention!

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.010
He's fast...

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.530
So fast that it has no 
time to harden its skin!

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.320
We can go for the neck...

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:04.980
It's tired...

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.260
I bet it can't move!

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.930
I can kill it!

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.300
Stop!

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.280
Eren!

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.040
Hey!

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.830
We're getting out of here!

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.140
Eren...

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.190
I think he's okay...

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:44.020
He's alive!

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.500
But filthy.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.820
Forget about it...

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.280
We'll retreat.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.070
Don't lose sight of the core objective.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.780
Is it more important 
to get what you want?

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.770
Isn't he an important friend?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.270
No, I...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.840
They're already coming back?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.570
What happened?

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:28.900
No idea...

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.970
But I bet they're bringing plenty 
of dead bodies with them again.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.120
Eldo is coming home.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.680
I see.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.410
Think Oluo will have time to come home?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.210
It wouldn't hurt to make 
him dinner, just in case.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.840
Gunther's coming back.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.480
I see.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:21.830
This is the part I never get used to.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.880
No one does.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.020
How are my friends going to die?

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.510
How am I going to die?

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.850
It's all you can think about.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.720
I try not to dwell on it.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.270
If I pictured how I'm going to die,

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.690
I probably wouldn't be able to fight.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.480
Yeah.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.150
You're right.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.580
How long will I stay alive?

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.490
You're alive now, aren't you?

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.060
For now.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:07.800
Isn't that a good thing?

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.300
You're alive!

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.460
Can you say that in front of 
the bodies of those who aren't?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.450
I might not be able 
to go home anymore...

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.750
We're almost done.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.780
There were about five 
dead we couldn't recover.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.190
Not even a part of them?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.580
They're the only ones we 
couldn't due to the Titans...

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.780
It's probably best for the families 
that we not bring those back.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.980
Say they're MIA.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.770
Yes, sir.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:53.040
We saw several Titans near the forest,

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.460
but none are headed this way as of yet.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.460
We're moving out now.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.290
Tell all the squads.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.350
Yes, sir.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.960
I cannot accept this, Commander Erwin!

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.810
Hey, you...

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.710
We should recover them!

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.820
Ivan's body was right in front of us!

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.280
There was a Titan right next to him...

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.110
It could result in another casualty!

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.310
If they attack, we can just defeat them!

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.560
Ivan's an old friend. 
We're from the same town.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.280
I know his parents.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.850
If nothing else, I'd 
like to bring him home!

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.170
Don't be selfish!

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.680
Squabbling kids?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.760
Captain Levi...

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.420
If you confirmed he's 
dead, that's enough.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.870
Whether you have the body, dead is dead.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.230
It won't change anything.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.130
No...

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.430
We'll say Ivan and the 
others went missing.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.330
That's my final decision.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.380
Give it up.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.860
Don't the two of you

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.840
have any human feelings at all?!

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.360
Hey, Dieter... You're going too far!

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.960
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.960
Survey Corps Wagons (1) 
These wagons include a complicated suspension system 
of ultra-hard steel that can only be made in factory cities.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.960
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.960
Survey Corps Wagons (2) 
Wagons hitched to Survey Corps horses travel 
around 20 km/h. They can maintain their speed 
on various terrain, be it paved or unpaved road.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.570
Titans!

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.210
That's...

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.460
Dieter!

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.540
That fool...

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.720
The rear line has sighted Titans!

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.220
Onward at full speed!

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:12.730
I don't see any tall trees or buildings.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.440
Fighting out here will be difficult.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.000
We're better off outrunning 
them till we reach the walls.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.370
They're going to catch us!

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.390
Do we have to fight?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.380
Maneuver Gear has limited 
utility in open areas!

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:52.810
And look...

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.680
They just keep coming!

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:58.400
Then what do we do?

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.230
We...

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.060
No! They'll reach us!

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.910
I'll get behind them!

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.530
I'll draw their attention, then you—

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.570
No.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.700
Just abandon the bodies.

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.110
They'll reach us.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.070
B-But...

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.910
In the past, many bodies 
haven't made it back.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.750
These guys aren't anything special.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.290
Are we doing this?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.580
Are we really doing it?!

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.340
Damn it...

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.590
We have to!

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.120
Okay!

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.410
Keep going!

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.070
As soon as we know where 
we are, we will depart.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.640
Stay alert!

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.650
We'll have to slightly alter 
our route to the east...

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.660
Captain Levi...

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:15.730
I...

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.540
This proves that they were alive.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.560
To me, at least.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.600
This was Ivan's.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.840
Captain...

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.690
We're leaving!

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.050
Eren, you should stop 
considering the Survey Corps.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:23.300
What? You're going to tell 
me they're stupid, too?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.220
That isn't it...

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.450
The Survey Corps is back!

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.390
The front gate's opening!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.400
Let's go, Mikasa!

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.860
The heroes are back!

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.840
These are all that made it back?

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.750
Everyone else must've been eaten.

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.080
That's what happens when 
you go outside the walls.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.190
It's like our taxes all 
go to fatten them up.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.440
Eren?

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.080
What's wrong?

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:30.500
Eren...

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.380
Eren!

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.300
Eren...

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.440
You shouldn't get up.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.690
Rest.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.200
The Female Titan?

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.700
It got away.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.740
Why?

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.780
What about the others?

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.210
What about the plan?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.290
It failed...

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.450
Rest for the time being.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.350
What is this?

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.720
Did you save me again?

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.230
We're almost to the walls.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.910
Aren't there fewer than 
there were this morning?

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.240
Man...

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.040
Far fewer...

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.540
Another disaster.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.010
Just this morning, they left raising a ruckus, 
but they're already back?

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.930
What was the point?

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.500
Who knows?

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.180
But judging by the gloomy expressions,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.510
they managed to waste more 
of our taxes, if nothing else.

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.820
Eren, just bear with it.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.570
So cool!

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.490
The Survey Corps is so awesome!

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.180
They got the crap kicked out 
of them, and they still fight!

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:58.820
Captain Levi!

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.360
My daughter is in your squad...

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.240
I'm Petra's father.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.200
Before she sees me, I 
wanted to talk to you.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.240
She sent me this letter...

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.590
She mentioned that you respected her 
abilities enough to let her join your squad.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.000
That she was going to devote herself to you.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.790
Well, I guess she's too starry-eyed 
to consider how her father feels!

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.090
Well, as her father,

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.880
I think it's too early for her to marry.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.850
She's still so young, with 
so much to experience...

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.680
Commander Erwin! Answer us!

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.860
Did this expedition learn enough 
to justify the number of dead?

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.300
Do you think the dead have no regrets?

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.680
The expenses and casualties from 
the expedition were more than enough

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.880
to discredit the faction that had 
supported the Survey Corps.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:12.670
As those responsible, including Erwin, 
were summoned to the capital,

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.490
it was decided that Eren 
was to be handed over.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.710
That day, Annie was part

00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.640
of the escort guard for Eren and the others, 
as they answered a summons to the capital.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.110
Suddenly, Armin appeared,

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.160
and asked Annie to assist with 
a highly sensitive mission.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.060
