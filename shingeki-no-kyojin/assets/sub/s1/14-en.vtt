WEBVTT

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.810
Answer up, you piece of crap.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.300
What do you want to do?

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.600
I want to join the Survey Corps

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.820
and just slaughter the Titans!

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.660
Oh?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.750
Not bad.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.330
Erwin,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.580
I'll take responsibility for him.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.130
Convey that to the brass.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.510
It isn't that I trust him.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.670
If he betrays us or loses control, 
I'll kill him on the spot.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.050
They shouldn't complain.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.020
Because only I can do it.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.020
I accept your request.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.940
You can join the Survey Corps.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.990
Still Can't See 
Night Before the Counteroffensive (1)

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.240
Hey, is there really a Titan that 
has sided with humanity?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.490
Obviously, it's just a rumor.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.600
It's possible the mission to retake

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.880
our land will fail, and we'll end up with 
tons of refugees from Wall Rose.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.220
Wall Sina Interior

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.940
If that happens, we'll immediately 
have a food shortage.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.030
Hey...

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.580
Maybe that Titan is going to join 
the Rose inhabitants and invade us.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.530
Wall Sina

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.530
Wall Rose

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.370
It's amazing!

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.500
A Titan on our side has appeared!

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.410
Wall Rose Interior

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.590
Maybe we can even take back Wall Maria!

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.670
You could even say...

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.060
You could even say he's our savior!

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.350
A savior, huh?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.850
Whatever the era, people are so irresponsible.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.520
He'll probably be a pawn in a 
revolt against the Center.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.280
Before that happens, we of the Military 
Police must eliminate Eren Jaeger.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.700
We can't let those Survey Corps weirdos have him.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.410
Attention!

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.050
Salute our commander!

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.800
It's hot...

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.600
Commander Pixis,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.020
don't you suppose that some

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.690
might not approve of the Garrison 
Commander meeting privately

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.860
with the commander of the Survey Corps?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.070
Ah, you're as stiff-necked as they say.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.570
Don't worry.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.200
I simply happened to run into you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.570
during my morning walk.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.450
And we are merely engaging in 
small talk as I enjoy my walk.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.210
Are you aware the Military Police 
now want Eren Jaeger, too?

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.290
Yes.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.960
I received a message yesterday.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.720
A military tribunal will decide.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.930
Hmm...

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.430
Zackley has been authorized to decide whether

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.220
the Survey Corps or Military Police get him.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.020
Zackley...

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.560
Commander-in-Chief Darius Zackley?

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.360
The man who controls all three military 
forces: the Military Police,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.820
the Garrison, and the Survey Corps.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.950
His decisions are based only on one criterion:

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.950
whether it's good or bad for humanity.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.830
If he thinks Eren is a threat,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.580
he'll order Eren's execution 
without a second thought.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.380
Right on the spot.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.920
I don't want to let Eren die.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.460
But sadly, many among the Garrison fear him...

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.430
All I can do is refuse to cast my 
lot with the Military Police.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.020
Do you think you can win?

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.410
No.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.740
But I'm prepared to make a proposal.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.450
Whether it works will depend 
on how the inquiry goes.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.660
Then you won't know until you're there?

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.800
Our mandate is investigating beyond the walls.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.860
So we never know what we'll see till we're there.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.510
I guess there is more to you than I thought.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.260
It's been an excellent walk, Commander Smith.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.770
Eren's inquisition...

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.680
What's it about?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.560
I'm not sure, but I'd guess they're 
deciding what to do with Eren.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.010
What to do with him?

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.690
Probably whether to kill him or let him live.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.350
Mikasa Ackerman! Armin Arlert!

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.200
Are you here?

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.610
Yes, sir.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.670
You've been ordered to appear

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.000
as witnesses at this afternoon's inquiry.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.690
I'm sorry, but I need the restroom.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.260
You just went!

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.180
Please give me some water.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.990
Hey...

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.360
Know your place, monster.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.190
Monster?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.280
That's true, but...

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.200
But they're so afraid of me, 
they have to chain me up?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.830
I guess I understand...

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.440
It's not like I know what's happening, either.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.010
Maybe I'm lucky I'm not already dead.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.010
Come to think of it...

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.730
Those two weren't ever scared of me.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.520
What are they doing now?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.750
And the others...

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.460
What happened to them?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.950
Give us a little more time.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.450
We'll persuade them somehow.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.490
It's been days since then.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.210
What's going on outside?

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.190
I won't be in here forever, will I?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.560
So you're Eren, huh?

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.010
Are you okay? Anything new?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.310
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.610
But it seems you're finally getting out.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.110
But you'll have to wear these.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.870
I'm Hanji Zoe, a Survey Corps squad leader.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.750
He's another squad leader, Mike Zacharius.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:45.960
Um...

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.270
He has the habit of smelling 
people he's just met,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.800
and then smirking.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.350
I don't think it has any real significance...

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.770
After all, he's good enough that 
they gave him a squad.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.770
Oh, sorry! Too much chit-chat.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.370
We're already here.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.640
Don't worry.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.280
It's actually better not to get 
any explanation in advance.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.260
Wait!

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.330
I know it's selfish,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.610
but we have no choice but to blindly trust you.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.760
Good luck!

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.230
The military court...

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.560
This whole time, I was below the military court?

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.980
Step forward.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.980
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.980
Special Military Tribunal (1) 
A military court that judges soldiers 
and military personnel. The judge, 
prosecution, and defense are all 
composed of military personnel.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.990
Special Military Tribunal (2) 
Politics have more influence than in a 
normal military tribunal. 
Darius Zackley, leader of the three 
military forces, makes the final decision.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.980
Kneel there!

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.110
What's with this lineup?

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.580
What are they even judging here?

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.230
You guys...

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.520
Well then, let us begin.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.520
Eren Jaeger, yes?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.560
You are a soldier, sworn to sacrifice 
your life for the public good.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.190
Is that correct?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.650
Yes, sir.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.890
This is an exceptional situation.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.560
This tribunal will be held under 
military, not civilian, law.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.090
The final decision rests entirely in my hands.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:58.900
Your fate will be decided here.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.370
I knew it...

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.430
Do you have any objections?

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.850
No, sir.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.340
I appreciate your perception.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.600
I will be direct.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.320
As anticipated, concealing your 
existence has proved impossible.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.610
We must make your existence 
public in some form,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.890
or a threat to humanity other 
than Titans may arise.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:27.490
What I will decide today is which 
force will have custody of you.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.790
The Military Police?

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.120
Or the Survey Corps?

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.840
Then, I ask the Military Police for their proposal.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.670
Yes, sir.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.170
I, Commander of the Military Police,

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.660
Nile Dawk, will present my proposal.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:47.180
After a thorough investigation of Eren's body,

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.930
we believe he should be 
eliminated immediately.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.480
It's certainly true that his Titan power 
overcame our previous peril.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.850
However, now his existence 
threatens to spark a civil war.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.030
So we ask him to die for humanity's sake,

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.750
leaving behind all the information he can.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.120
There is no need for that!

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.360 line:20%
He is an invasive pest!

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.360 line:20%
He has deceived the walls that embody God's wisdom!

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.050
That's one of the Wallists.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.130 line:20%
He must be killed at once!

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.510
Five years ago, no one paid 
any attention to them...

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.510 line:20%
Priest Nick.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.170 line:20%
Order, please.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.170
But they've gained power.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.400
We'll hear the Survey Corps's proposal next.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.810
Yes, sir.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.930
I, 13th Commander of the Survey Corps,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.520
Erwin Smith, will present my proposal.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.830
We would welcome Eren as an 
official member of our forces,

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:43.070
and use his power to retake Wall Maria.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.330
That is all.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.660
That's all?

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:51.410
Yes, sir.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.300
With his power, we can retake Wall Maria.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.840
We believe it is clear what 
our priorities should be.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.550
I see.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.510
And where do you plan to begin this mission?

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.020
Pixis, the Trost wall has been 
completely sealed, correct?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.100
Yes, it can never be opened again.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.560
We would like to set out 
from Karanes, in the east.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.320
Karanes District

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.320
Trost District

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.320
Zhiganshina District

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.730
From there, we will proceed to Zhiganshina.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.320
We will determine the route as we go.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.890
Wait a minute!

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.110
Shouldn't we seal all the wall 
gates once and for all?

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.850
The Colossal Titan can only destroy the gates.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.510
If we can strengthen them, 
we needn't endure further attacks!

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.800
Shut up, merchant dog!

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.570
With that Titan's power, 
we can return to Wall Maria!

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.970
We can no longer indulge your 
delusions of grandeur!

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.800
You talk a lot, pig.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.430
Where is your proof

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.470
that the Titans will wait while we seal the gates?

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.480
The "we" you speak of are only those

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.540
you wish to protect, your "friends" 
who help line your pockets.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.860
The people who starve because 
there isn't enough land to sow

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.450
don't even figure into the thoughts of you pigs.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.280
We just thought that we could 
survive by sealing the wall gates—

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.580
Silence!

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.300
Impious traitor!

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.710
Mere humans altering Wall Rose, 
walls that were a gift from God?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.520
Can you truly see those walls,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.680
God's work far beyond human capabilities,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.580
and not understand?

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.010
Thanks to them,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.320 line:20%
Humanity is not fit to lay a single finger on those walls!

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.130
it took ages before we could even 
mount weaponry on the walls.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.930
They have a lot of support and power, 
which makes them difficult.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.160
Heresy!

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.370
I'll have you be quiet, priest!

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.190
What?

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.370
Silence.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.240
You may discuss your personal philosophies 
and opinions elsewhere.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.260
Jaeger, I wish to confirm something.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.580
Can you continue to serve as a soldier, 
using your Titan powers

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.380
to benefit humanity?

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.290
Yes, I can!

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.220
But the report on Trost's defense says this...

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:11.390
"Immediately after turning into a Titan, 
he swung his fist at Mikasa Ackerman."

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.890
He doesn't remember being unable to control it...

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.710
You want me to lie in a report?

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.540
Hiding the truth wouldn't help humanity.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.250
Is Mikasa Ackerman present?

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.030
Yes, that's me.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.070
You are Ackerman?

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.770
Is it true that, as a Titan, 
Jaeger attacked you?

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.500
Lying isn't going to help Eren one bit.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.090
Yes, it's true.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.800
I knew it... He's just another Titan.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.410
I tried to kill Mikasa?

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.380
Me?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.670
But on two previous occasions,

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.880
Eren saved my life in his Titan form.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.440
The first time,

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.440
mere seconds before a Titan would 
have had me in his grasp,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.760
he stood between us, protecting me.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.360
The second time, he saved Armin 
and me from an HE shell.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.600
I would like these facts to 
be considered, as well.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.380
I object.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.380
I believe these comments are greatly 
colored by her personal feelings.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:34.400
At an early age, Mikasa Ackerman lost her parents,

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.740
and was taken in by the Jaeger household.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.350
Our investigation has also revealed

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.060
a surprising fact about the underlying events.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.990
At age nine, Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackerman

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.490
killed three robbers who tried to kidnap her.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.250
Even if it was self-defense,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.850
I must question their fundamental humanity.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:09.400
Is it right to entrust humanity's fate, 
resources, and lives to him?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.100
That's right!

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.680
He's just a Titan that infiltrated 
us by pretending to be a child!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.930
So is she!

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.950
Do we know that she's human?

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.560
That's right! Just to be safe, 
we should dissect her!

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.120
Wait!

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.810
I may be a monster, but she 
has nothing to do with it!

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.140
Nothing at all!

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.520
We can't trust that!

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.320
It's true!

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.980
If you're covering for her, 
it means she's one of you!

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:32.650
No!

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.030
I mean...

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.290
You are wrong.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.890
But you're simply coming 
up with theories that fit

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.790
whatever it suits you to think.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.670
What did you say?

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.330
Besides, all of you people...

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.230
Is this smart?

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.360
You've never even seen a Titan!

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.180
What are you so afraid of?

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.750
Should I just keep my mouth shut?

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.490
No, I'll tell them everything I'm thinking.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.190
What is the point if those with the 
means and power do not fight?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.880
If you're afraid to fight for survival,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.480
then help me!

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.400
You... cowards!

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.530
What?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.030
Just shut up!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.530
And bet everything you have on me!

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.300
Weapons ready!

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.100
Yes, sir!

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:34.410
Huh?

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.270
Wait, Mikasa!

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.250
This is a personal opinion.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.760
But I believe pain to be the 
best way to train someone.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:04.950
What you need is to be trained 
like a dog, not a man.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.960
It's easier to kick you while you're kneeling, too.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.470
Wait, Levi...

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.070
What is it?

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:25.100
That's dangerous...

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.090
What if he gets angry and turns into a Titan?

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.330
What are you saying?

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.440
Aren't you going to dissect him?

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.050
When he turned into a Titan last time,

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.710
he killed twenty other Titans before collapsing.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.010
If he is an enemy, his intelligence 
makes him a more formidable foe.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.000
Still no match for me, of course.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.770
But what will you do?

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.370
Anyone persecuting him should 
also consider that fact.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.630
Do you really think you can kill him?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.800
Sir, I have a proposal.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.420
What is it?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.570
The details of Eren's Titan power remain uncertain.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.810
Making it dangerous.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.700
Thus, I propose to have Captain Levi 
take responsibility for Eren's control,

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.570
and embark on an expedition outside the walls.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.490
With Eren in tow?

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:23.820
Yes, sir.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.310
Based on the expedition's results,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.250
I'd like you to judge whether Eren 
can control his Titan power

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.710
and whether he is a boon or bane to humanity.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.570
Control Eren Jaeger...

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.460
Can you do it, Levi?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.760
I'm certain I can kill him.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.890
The only problem is I doubt I can do any less.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.480
Then my decision is made.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.990
That was really terrible.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.520
It hurts, right?

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.510
A little.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.880
So, how does it hurt?

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.280
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:13.660
But thanks to that, 
we had you turned over to us.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.650
Yes, sir.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.820
The pain you endured allowed me to play my cards

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.800
at the right moment.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:23.800
You have my respect.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.970
Eren, I look forward to working with you.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.990
Yes, sir! Thank you!

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.910
Hey, Eren...

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.260
Yes, sir?

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.400
Do you resent me?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.000
N-No...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.750
I understand why it was necessary.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.000
That's good.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.270
But you took it a little far.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.410
You lost a tooth.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.710
See?

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.870
Don't pick that up... It's creepy.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.230
Even this is an important sample.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:57.790
Eren, it's still better than getting 
dissected by people like Hanji, right?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.730
I'm not like them...

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:03.550
I wouldn't kill him.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.090
Hey, Eren...

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.110
Let me see the inside of your mouth.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:16.440
The tooth...

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.020
It's already grown back.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:57.290
Eren has finally been assigned 
to the Survey Corps of his dreams.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.450
But he finds that the Corps is a group of people

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.900
who long for revolution...

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.060
Or perhaps it is a den of madmen.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.090
Special Ops Squad 
Night Before the Counteroffensive (2)
