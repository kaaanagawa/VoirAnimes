WEBVTT

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.640
In the year 845...

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.120
the Colossal and Armored Titans

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.780
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.640
along with the life we'd known.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.270
And the insatiable hunger of the Titans 
was unleashed on humanity

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.910
after a hundred years of deprivation.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.790
No!

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.490
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.670
losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.760
to retreat within Wall Rose.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.980
Night of the Graduation Ceremony 
Humanity Rises Again (2)

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.700
The Year: 850

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.280
2 Years After Enlistment

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.570
You're too slow!

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.330
Run, you laggards!

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.580
What's wrong, Arlert?

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.370
You're falling behind!

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.790
Is it too heavy for you?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.500
Will you be the one guy to remove his equipment?

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.590
If this were a real fight, 
you'd be Titan food by now!

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.850
Damn it!

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.850
Give me that.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.140
At this rate, we'll all fail out!

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.560
We're being graded on this exercise.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.270
If you do that, you'll lose points, as well.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.770
Just don't let them find out!

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.280
And don't make me change my mind!

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.950
Reiner Braun.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.830
A strong soldier, physically and mentally.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.210
And trusted by his comrades.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.340
I will not slow everyone down, even if it kills me!

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.480
Armin Arlert.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.760
While lacking in physical strength,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.970
he's demonstrated an 
extraordinary aptitude for his studies.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.870
Annie Leonhart.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.660
Her strike form is flawless,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.050
but she works poorly with others 
and tends to isolate herself.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.470
Bertolt Hoover.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.000
He has great potential, but lacks initiative.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.090
Jean Kirschstein.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.670
A master of 3D Maneuver Gear,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.030
but his brash personality causes 
friction with the team.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.560
I can't strike as hard as those two,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.020
so I'll have to find the Titan first!

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.120
I'll be the one who makes 
it into the Military Police!

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.150
Thanks, Jean!

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.870
I was right to follow you!

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.960
Sasha Blause.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.460
She has unconventional, good instincts,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.920
but they make her unsuited to teamwork.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.600
Connie Springer.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.430
He demonstrates superior physical agility, 
but lacks mental agility.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.680
They're coming!

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.100
Damn.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.730
Mikasa's beat me again in strike depth!

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.810
Mikasa Ackerman.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.680
A master of all subjects,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.000
and widely considered 
one of the best in our history.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.120
Eren Jaeger.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.080
He has no outstanding talents,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.540
but he's worked harder than 
anyone to improve his marks.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.070
And he is more motivated to 
attain his goal than anyone.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.260
Ouch...

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.060
Sorry, I'm not good at holding back...

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.380
Now it's your turn to be the bandit.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.070
What's wrong?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.870
What's the point of this training?

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.370
Why are soldiers training 
to fight people like this?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.670
Only an idiot would fight an opponent unarmed.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.170
Where's your sense of responsibility?

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.710
We're soldiers.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.900
We may be called on to fight at a severe disadvantage, 
and retreat will not be an option.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.260
We must be able to handle any opponent,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.210
whether that means using 
a cannon or martial arts.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.520
That is our responsibility as soldiers.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.340
Forget all that... Look.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.070
Oh, Annie?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.200
As usual, she's good at slacking off 
without getting found out by the instructor.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.830
Okay, Eren...

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.040
I think that slacker needs a lesson.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.250
Let us show her what a soldier should strive to be.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.420
You don't want the instructor to 
headbutt you again, do you?

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.600
If you don't want to get any shorter,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.800
remember what happened when you 
came here, and take this seriously.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800
Hey, isn't that a little harsh?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.600
She's really mad.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.150
I always thought she was scary looking,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.900
but she's way worse when she's really mad.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.320
Let's get going, Eren.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.360
Me?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.950
Annie, you know how to do this, right?

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.200
Here I go!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.710
What?

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.460
Did she kick my leg?

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.300
Can I go?

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.260
No, this drill doesn't end 
until you grab the dagger.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.690
Wait, Annie.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.520
You're supposed to do this a certain way!

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.480
Here.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.530
Now it's your turn to attack me.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.110
No, I...

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.280
Go on, Reiner...

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.790
Weren't you going to teach her 
a soldier's responsibilities?

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.460
Yeah.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.960
Sometimes, a soldier can't retreat.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.590
Like now!

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.380
That was amazing.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.980
Where did you learn that?

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.230
My father.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.850
Your dad taught you that?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.100
It doesn't matter.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.690
There isn't any point in doing this.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.860
You mean this exercise?

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.780
Martial arts won't improve your score.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.530
You should just go through 
the motions, like them.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.660
The only ones allowed to join the Military 
Police and go deep within the walls

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.190
are those who rank in the final top ten.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.540
The only ones who take this seriously

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.090
are either people like you, 
who do whatever they're told,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.980
or real idiots.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.340
Crap, the instructor...

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.470
For whatever reason,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.070
the better equipped you are to fight Titans,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.970
the farther you're assigned from them.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.940
Where do you think this farce begins?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.520
I don't know!

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.160
Isn't it because that is how humans really are?

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.260
Anyway, I'm not stupid enough

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.130
to enjoy playing soldiers in this shitty world.

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.840
You aren't cut out to be a soldier at all.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.420
I was so focused on getting stronger, 
I never even realized...

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.770
such an obvious contradiction.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.900
They're honing their Titan-killing skills

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.270
so that they'll never need to fight them.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.530
That can't be helped.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.910
Before Wall Maria fell,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.600
only the few in the Survey Corps needed 
to know how to use Maneuver Gear.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.710
To save the knowledge base from decline,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.250 line:20%
Just give it one strong blast.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.930
they used the Interior to motivate...

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.960 line:20%
Use the generated momentum, 
and you'll conserve fuel.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.210
You make it sound so easy.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.670
Well, I guess not everyone can do it...

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.390
But it's worth remembering.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.810
If you want to join the Military Police, anyway.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.240
Yeah, I hope I can get in...

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.380
I can't imagine a greater honor 
than serving near the King.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.770
Hey, Marco.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.230
Cut the noble act and tell the truth!

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.440
You want to join the Military Police

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.070
because life deep inside 
the walls is soft and easy.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.140
No! I really think that...

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.620
An easy life, deep inside the walls?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.540
Until five years ago, this was 
considered deep inside the walls.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.000
What's your point, Eren?

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.060
You don't need to go to the Interior.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.130
You've gone soft enough in your own head.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.350
You...

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.560
Don't you think it's strange

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.520
that we're training to fight Titans, 
just to end up farther from them?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.770
Who cares?

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.730
For my own sake, I hope they 
keep this stupid system.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.750
You piece of shit!

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.610
Shut up! This is reality.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.990
Stop it, Eren.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.490
Stop.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.920
Screw you!

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.980
Let go! My clothes will rip!

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.420
Who cares about your clothes?!

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.000
I'm so envious!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.790
What are you talking about?

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.900
That's right, he...

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.220
He is who I used to be.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.900
A ranting idiot with no control.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.650
But I'm different now.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.190
I'll use what I've learned 
to handle this situation.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:11.540
What the hell was that?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.340
The martial arts I went through a world of hurt 
to learn while you were screwing around.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.590
You think taking the easy way out, 
doing as you please, is reality?

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.020
And you can call yourself

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.180
a soldier?

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.320
I heard quite a commotion.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.070
Would someone like to explain?

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.700
That sound was Sasha's fart.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.660
Huh?!

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.200
You again?

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.210
Learn to control yourself.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.790
In the end, two hundred and eighteen trainees 
managed to hang on till graduation.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.310
Dedicate your hearts!

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:21.780
Today, you trainee graduates 
will be given three choices.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.160
You can join the Garrison, 
protecting towns and reinforcing the walls.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.870
Or the Survey Corps, who risk their lives 
beyond the walls, in Titan territory.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.750
Or the Military Police, who serve the King, 
lead the people, and protect internal order.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.710
Of course, only the top ten students,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.170
whose names were just announced 
can join the Military Police.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.010
I finally made it this far.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.600
Now it's our turn

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.520
to devour the Titans!

I'm joining the Military Police!

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.190
We won't go hungry anymore!

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.800
How did I score lower than Eren?

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.200
Damn it!

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.120
You seriously aren't joining 
the Military Police, Eren?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.580
You did all that work to make the top ten.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.010
I'd already decided when I began.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.980
I wasn't training to live in the Interior.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.420
I was training to fight Titans.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.230
You'll never beat them!

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.980
You do know how many

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.320
tens of thousands have been eaten?

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.990
We lost over twenty percent of our 
population, so we know for sure.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.800
Humans cannot defeat Titans.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.020
So?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.130
If you think we can't win, you'll just give up?

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:10.090
Well...

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.100
It's true that humanity has 
only suffered defeat until now.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.040
But we didn't know anything 
about the Titans then.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.600
Fighting them head-on is pointless.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.400
We did lose,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.820
but the information we gained 
gives us hope for next time!

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:30.160
Will we abandon the tactics that cost 
tens of thousands of lives to develop,

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.210
and let the Titans eat us without a fight?

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:33.920
Hell, no!

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.550
I am going to exterminate all of the Titans,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.500
and escape these cramped walls!

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.470
That is my dream...

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.420
Humanity isn't finished yet!

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.660
Wait, Eren!

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.860
If you want to go outside the walls, then go.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.980
I'm joining the Military Police, at any cost.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.300
Eren, when you were talking about your dream...

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.880
Yeah, I got that from you.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.240
To live outside the walls, not inside.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.960
I'm joining the Survey Corps.

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.850
Are you serious, Armin?

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.800
You got the best written test score, 
so you should use that!

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.470
I won't hold you back, even if it kills me.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.570
I'm joining the Survey Corps, too.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.360
Hey, you're the valedictorian...

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.730
Join the Military Police!

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.190
If you join the Military Police,

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.560
then I'll do that.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.190
If you join the Garrison, I'll join, too.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.610
You'll send yourself to an early grave without me.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.990
No one asked you to do this...

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.730
I don't want to lose any more family.

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:26.590
They're here!

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:28.560
The main force of the Survey Corps!

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.330
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.590
Look, it's Captain Levi!

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.580
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.040
Shut up.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.670
This is totally different than five years ago...

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.560
There are so many people 
who have high hopes for the Survey Corps!

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.640
Everyone's cheered up.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.800
There haven't been any problems for five years.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.390
And they've improved the fixed cannons.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:58.240
Maybe the big Titans won't come again.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.300
Right!

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.220
You can't seriously believe that, 
you stupid lovebirds!

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.930
You think we're a happy couple?

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.390
You're getting ahead of yourself, Eren!

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.530
Hey, you guys!

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.510
Hannes!

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.290
I heard you graduated yesterday.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.040
Hard to believe you're the 
little kids I remember.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.960
What about you?

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.450
You've gone from a drunk to a 
captain of the combat engineers.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.700
Listen to you...

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.640
I'm still sorry

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.040
I wasn't able to save your mother.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.500
It wasn't your fault, Hannes.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.890
We aren't ignorant anymore.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.980
I'll never let anything that sad happen again.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.310
We will defeat the Titans.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.020
I don't know whether to be happy 
that you've grown up or not.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.370
Don't die.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.900
Huh?

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.990
You're joining the Survey Corps?

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.210
Connie, you were so eager 
to join the Military Police!

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:04.420
I was, but...

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.840
Your speech yesterday affected him.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.140
Shut up!

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.810
It was my own decision!

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.970
No need to feel embarrassed.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.390
It isn't just you.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.700
Thomas...

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.600
You can't...

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.700
Um, everyone...

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.350
I brought meat from the officers' storehouse.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.360
Sasha, do you want to end up in jail?!

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.950
You really are an idiot!

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.440
Idiots are scary...

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.320
Let's all split it...

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.640
We can slice it and make sandwiches!

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.670
Go put it back!

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:43.410
Yeah...

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.410
After all the land we lost, 
meat is really valuable!

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.260
It's fine!

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.890
Once we retake the land, we can 
raise cows and sheep again.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.590
I'll have some of the meat, too!

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.390
M-Me, too! Get it ready!

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.440
I also will, of course!

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.970
You guys...

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.360
Why are you standing there, Eren?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.320
We need to get back to work, or they'll find out.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.230
It isn't lunchtime yet.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.670
It's been five years since then...

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.980
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.590
We can win!

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.010
Our counterattack

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.610
has only begun!

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.860
So hot!

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.010
Wh-What is that?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.410
Samuel!

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.460
Sasha!

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.300
Samuel,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.600
don't move!

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.240
That was close...

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.960
The wall has been breached?

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.240
Not again...

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.730
The Titans will come inside the walls again!

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.410
I will annihilate all of you!

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.770
Annihilate all of you...

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.540
Fixed cannon maintenance team 4,

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.070
prepare for combat!

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.900
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.420
This is our chance!

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.300
Don't let it get away!

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.360
Hey, there...

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.550
It's been five years.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.030
Hell has reopened its gaping maw.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.810
There is no reprieve as Titans devour soldiers.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:05.960
In the midst of it all,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.360
Eren rescues Armin from death's door, but...

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.850
First Battle 
Battle of Trost (1)
