00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.540
The Survey Corps left to 
find a route to Zhiganshina,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.080
but encountered an 
intelligent Female Titan.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.900
As soldiers died, one after the next,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.210
they headed into a 
forest of giant trees,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.370
none of them knowing why.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.510
If Squad Levi doesn't 
defeat it, who will?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.760
Another one's dead...

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.750
And maybe we could've saved him!

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.960
Choose.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.010
Believe in yourself.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.270
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.480
I'll go forward!

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.780
Fire!

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.080
He can't intend

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.670
to take that Titan alive?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.170
Well, Eren? See that?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.050
We caught that Titan!

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.350
This is the power of the Survey Corps!

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.180
Don't underestimate us, fool.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.930
Well? Do you get it now?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.250
Yes!

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.390
Looks like it's stopped moving...

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.650
We can't lower our guard.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.810
But you did well, leading it here.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.510
Men in the rearguard squads died 
buying us the time we needed.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.450
We couldn't have done it without them.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.770
Is that so?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.410
It is.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.340
Thanks to them, we'll be able 
to see who's inside this thing.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.080
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.980
Erwin Smith 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (4)

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.990
An Aberrant?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.160
Or is it like the Colossal Titan?

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.940
Did Commander Erwin...

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.570
Hey, snap out of it!

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.820
Eren, think later.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610
We need to get farther in and stand by!

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.750
Right!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.100
Wait, Levi...

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.370
An eye for an eye.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.680
Waves 2 and 3, fire!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.420
Fire the spare rounds!

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.170
Um, it's climbing up...

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.440
Yeah.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.800
If it gets this far, I'll 
move out of the way.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.540
But I don't think it will be long before

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.780
they issue withdrawal orders.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.700
Does that have something 
to do with the explosions

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.870
we've been hearing deep within the forest?

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.870
I don't know.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.240
Mikasa, what do you think that sound is?

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.410
Are they firing cannons in the forest?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.540
It didn't seem like they'd 
brought cannons, though.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.130
It's really loud back there.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.240
Hey, Bertolt...

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.840
Do you know where Krista went?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.870
Sorry, I don't know.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.270
I have no idea what's going on.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.640
What am I doing and why?

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.090
I want to go home.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.690
We're going to shift position, Armin.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.390
Okay.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.190
They've started to figure it out.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.070
They seem to keep getting better 
and better at climbing.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.570
That means, scary as it 
sounds, they can learn.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.660
Although some are better 
than others, I'm sure.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.570
Armin...

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.330
Sounds like something is going 
on deeper in the forest.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.630
I think I have some idea what.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.010
They lured that Female Titan all the 
way here in order to capture it.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.960
More precisely...

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.310
To capture whoever is inside of it.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.930
That was Commander Erwin's goal...

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.480
That was his plan from the very start!

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.940
Right?

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.500
I can see why he wouldn't 
have told the new troops.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.350
But why wouldn't he tell you

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.990
when you've all been with the 
Survey Corps for so long?

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.160
Shut up!

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.330
Are you saying the Commander 
and the Captain don't trust us?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.870
But that's what this means...

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.160
Petra, rip out his teeth!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.900
Swap the front and back teeth 
when you shove 'em back in!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.870
No, Eren's right.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.220
I think there was a reason the 
Commander couldn't trust us.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.220
Like what?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.220
There's only one reason he 
wouldn't trust his fellow soldiers.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.090
There's someone who can become a Titan,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.710
or a spy helping them, 
in the Survey Corps.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.250
You think so, too, right?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.390
It has to be one of us.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.300
Yes, I think so.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.900
A spy?

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.620
Is that possible?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.280
At any rate, the Commander is certain.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.790
I'd imagine the only soldiers who 
were told of the plan were those

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.130
who've stayed alive for 
the past five years.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.040
I see...

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.530
So that's it.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.470
Must be.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.800
Understand, Eren?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.050
That's why.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.890
Yeah, if that's the 
reason, I understand.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.730
He's assuming that five years ago, 
when the first wall fell,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.930
a spy infiltrated our ranks...

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.400
And that's how he narrowed 
down the possibilities.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.940
Then, the spy killed Sawney and Bean?

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.330
Back then, the Commander 
asked me about that.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.240
What do you see?

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.990
What do you think the enemy is?

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.000
That's what the question meant?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.250
If we could've answered it,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.170
maybe we could've 
participated in this plan.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.300
I doubt that anyone could've 
back then, though.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.220
I knew.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.140
But I didn't say anything.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.760
Do you know why?

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.310
Why?

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.440
What, you can't tell?

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.600
Well, I shouldn't expect that 
much from the likes of you.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.150
You have yet to reach my level.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.360
Hey, are you copying Captain Levi again?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.450
The Captain wouldn't 
say anything like that.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.620
If this succeeds, I can get closer 
to the truth of this world.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:42.050
But... Too many died, regardless.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.340
Do you think the Commander was wrong?

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.560
I can't say he was right.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.280
If we'd known there was a Titan 
informed of our operations,

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.500
we would've dealt with 
this in a different way.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.480
Your team's squad leader and 
the others would've, too.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.390
No, it wasn't wrong.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.690
What wasn't wrong?

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.650
How many do you think 
died for no reason?

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.090
Jean, after the fact, it's easy to say, 
"We should've done something else."

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.910
However,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.120
no one knows how things will turn out.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.920
And even so, you have to make a choice.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.390
You must.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.720
The lives of a hundred 
fellow soldiers...

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.770
Or the lives of all the humans 
within the walls...

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.260
The Commander made his choice.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.360
He chose to let those hundred die.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.400
Eren, you don't know it yet,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.070
but you will soon.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.650
The reason that Erwin Smith is 
entrusted with humanity's hope,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.190
the Survey Corps.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.790
Just look at how much 
Captain Levi trusts him!

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.160
If you live that long...

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.660
I haven't lived that long,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.840
but I'm certain of one thing.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.810
If there's anyone who can bring change,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.670
it will be someone willing to 
sacrifice what they care for.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.850
It will be someone who can throw aside

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.770
their humanity, in order 
to defeat monsters.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.520
Someone who can't sacrifice anything

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.150
can't ever change anything!

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
Special Target Capture Weapon (1) 
A newly developed weapon the Survey Corps 
created to capture a specific Titan.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.030
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.030
Special Target Capture Weapon (2) 
The barrels are loaded with seven steel tubes, 
each of which has coiled wires with arrowheads at both ends.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.650
Fire!

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.370
How do you like that?

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.830
You won't even be able 
to scratch an itch now.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.290
You won't be able to make a single move. 
Probably for the rest of your life.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.760
They're designed so that the 
more you heal your wounds,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.680
the more immobilized your joints become!

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.270
But they still can't draw 
out whoever is inside?

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.730
What are Levi and Mike doing?

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.710
It can selectively harden its skin 
to protect specific parts of its body?

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.430
It's similar to what I've 
heard of the Armored Titan.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.280
If we continue using the Maneuver 
Gear and blades, will it weaken?

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.310
We don't have time to find out.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.300
In that case...

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.190
Yes, sir?

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.320
Prepare the explosives.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.820
Blow off its hands.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.570
Yes, sir...

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.320
But there's a chance 
that the amount we carry

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.830
has enough firepower to 
also blow up what's inside.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.500
Then set them to amputate the wrists.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.000
Set them all off at once at my signal.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.830
Roger.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.350
Hey...

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.040
Why not just come out?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.340
We don't have time to waste.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.020
So...

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.240
What do you think will 
happen to you now?

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.280
Do you believe you can escape?

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.660
I wish you'd consider all the 
trouble we're going through...

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.080
As I recall, you killed 
my troops in various ways.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.660
Did you find it fun?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.880
Right now, I'm having fun.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.900
Well, so are you, right?

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.430
I think you can understand me.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.140
Oh, right...

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.560
I wanted to ask you something.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.690
Is it okay if we cut off 
your hands and legs?

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.540
They'll grow back, right?

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.480
I'm talking about <i>your </i>
limbs, not the Titan's.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.990
We need you alive, after all...

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.730
Well, that was a surprise.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.730
Were those her dying screams?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.420
Erwin, it stinks.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.700
What direction?

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.490
Multiple sources, from 
all directions at once.

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.960
What's up with them?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.460
They're all running into the forest?

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.570
Why did they suddenly start ignoring us?

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.180
What?

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.600
They're all Aberrants?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.640
It doesn't matter! 
Don't let them through!

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.310
Begin combat!

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.060
What just happened?

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.650
Wait...

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.860
I've heard that scream before.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.700
In the forests where I'm from...

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.870
It's the cry of a cornered animal 
that has nothing to lose!

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.630
I was taught to exercise greater caution 
once a hunt drew to a close!

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.080
So be careful?

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.420
A hundred times more than usual!

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.630
If you underestimate 
the forest, you'll die!

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.710
I grew up in the mountains, too.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.090
Someone who grew crops 
wouldn't understand!

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:08.920
I see.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.140
It's true that Sasha's 
intuition is usually good.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.600
Especially when she predicts 
things are going sour.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.690
Armin thought Eren would be in 
the center, toward the rear...

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.150
Ready those explosives, now!

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.160
Erwin...

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.660
The first wave will come from the east.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.570
They're almost here.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.490
Cart guard team, intercept!

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.670
They ignored us?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.800
Are they Aberrants?

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.130
Three are breaking through!

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:51.900
Captain Levi!

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.600
You just did something, 
didn't you, bitch?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.550
So they're after the Female Titan?

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.860
Titans from all directions!

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.280
All men, engage.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.290
Defend the Female Titan, 
even if it means your lives!

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.010
It's no use!

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.530
Retreat, men!

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.360
Back into formation!

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.530
Return to Karanes!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.140
We've been had.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.600
Just look at you.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.810
Don't tell me...

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.980
The enemy

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.440
was willing to sacrifice everything.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.240
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy 
itself along with the evidence

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.150
by making Titans devour itself.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.780
All our talk at the court martial, 
and this is what happens.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.300
If we return empty-handed, who knows

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.300

what will happen to Eren or us.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.650
We can think about that after we return.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.130
Our priority now is getting home 
without additional casualties.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.280
For now...

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.200
The steam from the corpse is limiting visibility.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.430
It could interfere with our signal 
flare message relay system.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.770
I'll call my team.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.400
Wait, Levi...

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.420
Refill your gas and blades.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.170
There isn't time.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.780
I think I have plenty.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.680
Why?

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.240
That's an order.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.030
Follow it.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.660
Roger, Erwin.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.170
I trust your decision.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.930
We're retreating.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.760
Everyone, retreat.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.720
Get back on your horse, and retreat.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.600
Right!

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.610
What? It's already over?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.730
We can go home! All right!

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.440
What's going on?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.280
Where's Eren?

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.530
Looks like it's over.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.550
Back to the horses! Prepare to retreat!

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.250
You heard the man...

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:11.670
Let's go see what the 
bastard inside looks like.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.420
Will we really find out who it is?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.840
It's thanks to you.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.730
I didn't really do anything.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.180
You had faith in us.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.020
This is the result of your choice 
to trust us back then.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.650
Making the right choice isn't easy.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.940
Hey, don't spoil him, Petra...

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.190
What did he do, anyway?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.560
He was pathetic. He just kept whining.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.200
Well, coming back alive on your 
first excursion is pretty good.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.410
But it doesn't count 
until the mission's over.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.250
Listen, kiddo, the expedition lasts 
until you're at home in bed...

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:54.750
Jeez, I know that!

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.960
Oluo! Petra!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.130
You guys pissed your pants and 
cried on your first mission.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.640
You're all grown up now!

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.510
Don't say that!

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.220
What if he stops respecting me?!

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.520
It's true?

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.770
It sure is.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.230
And I didn't, by the way, Eren.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.270
Idiot!

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.040
I've killed more of them than you!

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.570
More of them than you, idiot!

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.570
Kill count isn't all 
that makes a soldier.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.110
Shut up, idiot!

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.870
Petra...

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.990
Does that mean you sprayed 
it everywhere while mid-air?

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.290
Shut up!

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.080
Do you think you're on a picnic?

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.940
We're outside the walls!

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.310
I didn't piss my pants, either, Eren.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.890
Oh, I'm sure that's the 
signal from Captain Levi.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.890
We'll rendezvous with the Captain!

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.730
Cut the chatter till we get back.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.540
Erwin...

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.040
Why did you order Levi to resupply?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.130
There's no time to waste.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.340
The Female Titan was eaten.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.640
But did you see the 
person inside get eaten?

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.300
I didn't.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.590
You can't mean...

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.300
Yes...

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.060
If your original hypothesis was correct,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:34.230
and they can still move to a degree 
after regaining human form...

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.300
And if they'd equipped 
Maneuver Gear in advance...

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.290
The one within the Female Titan 
is wearing our uniform right now.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.900
Captain Levi?

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.630
No, it's not!

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.200
Who are you?!

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.670
G-Gunther!

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.420
What? Why?

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.510
Gunther!

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.020
The enemy is now camouflaged 
as one of our men.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.430
The capture operation has failed.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.280
The Female Titan appears 
before Eren once more.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.830
What stands between it and its target

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.210
are the master Titan killers,

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.280
the Special Ops Squad.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.680
Crushing Blow 
 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)
