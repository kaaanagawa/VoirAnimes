WEBVTT

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.300
In the year 845...

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.570
the Colossal and Armored Titans

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.890
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.110
along with the life we'd known.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.170
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.540
losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.190
to retreat within Wall Rose.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.820
Now, in the year 850...

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.340
Our counterattack

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.300
has only just begun!

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.710
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.890
This is our chance!

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.430
Don't let it get away!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.830
Hey, there...

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.430
It's been five years.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.000
First Battle 
Battle of Trost (1)

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.150
He was after the fixed cannons!

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.270
It's no coincidence it 
went for the gate, either...

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.530
This thing really is...

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.740
sentient!

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.660
But this is our chance!

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830
He's the only one that can take out the walls!

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.860
If I can kill him...

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.680
Too slow!

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.330
You're mine!

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.630
What?!

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.050
Go!

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.120
I missed?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.170
No...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.290
The Colossal Titan vanished?

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.450
Eren!

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.840
Did you defeat it?

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.200
No!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.790
It was the same as five years ago...

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.460
He appeared out of nowhere, 
and vanished just as suddenly!

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.580
I'm sorry.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.740
I let him get away.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.150
Why are you apologizing?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.920
The rest of us couldn't even move—

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.880
Hey, there's no time for discussion!

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.230
The wall's been breached.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.460
If we don't patch it fast, 
the Titans will get in like before!

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.790
What are you doing?

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.670
The contingency plan for 
the Colossal Titan has already begun.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.630
Get to HQ!

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.650
Anyone who made contact with it, 
don't forget to report!

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.370
Yes, sir!

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.500
Best of luck to the advance team!

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.070
Keep all personal belongings to a minimum!

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.300
Remain calm during the evacuation!

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.910
If they make it through,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.130
we'll relive the tragedy that 
befell us five years ago!

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.130
We stop the Titans here!

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.850
Prepare to intercept.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.920
Fire!

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.390
Attack!

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.150
You trainees have all passed

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.810
the final training exercise, 
and now are full-fledged soldiers.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.530
We expect great things from you.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.300
It's okay, Hannah...

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.000
I'll protect you.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.310
Franz...

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.940
Are you okay, Armin?

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.360
I-I'm fine.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.090
I'll get over it soon enough.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.200
B-But we're in bad shape.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.920
We currently don't have the means 
to quickly patch an eight-meter hole...

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.460
We never even managed to dig up 
that big rock near the front gate!

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.770
Since we can't seal the hole, 
we'll have to abandon the town.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.410
It's only a matter of time 
before they breach Wall Rose!

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:27.490
Besides,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.820
they can wipe out humanity 
whenever they want, anyway!

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.780
Armin!

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.060
Calm down...

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.480
Things are different now.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.000
Humanity won't be defeated by Titans anymore!

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.090
I'm sorry.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.180
I'm all right...

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.410
Hey, are you paying attention?

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.190
Look...

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.830
I win again.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.800
I'm nice enough to play with you every month,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.400
but you never improve, Pixis.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.950
I'm still no match for you, Marquis Bart.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.120
Aren't you the high commander 
overseeing the southern region?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.980
How can you defeat the Titans 
with that level of intelligence and skill?

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.400
Commander Pixis!

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.730
Urgent message!

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.180
How dare you interrupt our game—

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.400
The Colossal Titan has appeared in Trost.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.030
It's destroyed the gate!

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.300
This drink is excellent...

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.550
It will be my honor 
to take it with me into battle.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.390
H-Hey...

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.930
Wait, Pixis!

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.480
Pixis! Wait, will you?!

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.060
I won't allow you to leave.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.530
You must gather your forces, 
and defend my territory!

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.410
That's your duty, isn't it?

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.770
Marquis Bart,

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.780
my men are risking their 
lives in Trost right now.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.130
Commander, I'll ready your horse.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.810
And it's likely that 
many have already lost their lives.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.480
Many more dying this very moment, 
as we indulge in idle chitchat.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.300
They are expendable... Let them die.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.050
And you've never even won at chess.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.140
Your presence at the battle 
will accomplish nothing.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.000
Do not worry yourself, Marquis.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.060
In a real battle against the Titans,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.610
it is unnecessary for the commander 
to throw the match.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.410
That's enough.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.960
Marquis Bart,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.820
please enjoy a peaceful day, 
as you would any other.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.880
Wait...

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.010
Pixis! Come back, Pixis!

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.090
Pixis!

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.970
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.970
Fixed Cannons (1)
Anti-Titan weapons in existence before the 
invention of 3D maneuver gear. Placed on 
the walls and modified for defensive purposes 
to address the dearth in mobile troops.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.980
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.980
Fixed Cannons (2)
Grapeshot: Low lethality; used to slow Titans. 
HE Projectile: Powerful, but extremely 
inaccurate; targeted strikes are rarely successful.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.650
Just follow your training! Split into groups!

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.860
Under the Garrison's orders,

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.090
you will resupply combatants, relay orders,

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.660
and kill Titans!

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.740
Garrison intercept forces will form the vanguard!

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:08.250 position:20% line:20%
Vanguard

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.250
Trainees, led by the supply team, 
will comprise the middle guard!

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:08.250 position:20% line:50%
Middle Guard

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.870
The Garrison's elite forces will form the rearguard.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.250
Rearguard

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.580
Also, messengers report that the 
advance team has been neutralized.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.060
The outer gate has been compromised,

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.140
and Titans have entered the city.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.720
In other words, the Armored Titan

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.100
may appear at any time, to destroy the inner gate!

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.500
No way.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.520
You're kidding...

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.840
If we lose Rose, too...

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.360
Silence!

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:36.230
As we speak, the vanguard is engaging them.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.190
We have but one objective in this fight:

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.750
to defend Wall Rose with our lives 
until the evacuation is complete!

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.840
Also, as you are all surely aware,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.120
desertion in the face of the 
enemy is punishable by death.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.090
Mark this well, 
and fight to your last dying breath!

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.040
Dismissed!

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.430
Yes, sir!

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.550
Why today?

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.360
As of tomorrow, I would've been in the Interior...

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.250
Are you okay?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.540
No... No, no...

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.070
No, no... No!

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.150
You're in the way.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.040
Hey, Jean... What's wrong?

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.580
"What's wrong?"

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.000
Unlike you, I don't have a death wish!

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.200
Since you wanted to join the Survey Corps,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.550
I'm sure you're ready 
to become Titan food anytime!

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.240
But I was to go to the Interior tomorrow!

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.050
Calm down!

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.010
I'm supposed to stay calm and die?

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.110
No!

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:47.050
Don't forget

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.390
those three years of hell we endured!

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.260
In the past three years, 
we almost died so many times...

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.460
Some of us really did die.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.510
Some ran, and some were kicked out...

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.070
But we made it!

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.350
Didn't we?

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.240
So we can make it through today!

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:13.230
You'll survive today, and go to 
the Interior tomorrow, right?

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:19.470
Damn it.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:22.870
Let's go, Daz!

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.850
Stop sobbing!

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.530
Yeah...

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.080
Eren...

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.250
When the fighting gets fierce, come find me.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.360
Huh?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.190
You and I are on different teams!

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.630
Plans will fall apart in the chaos of battle.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.800
But I will protect you.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.010
What are you saying—

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.340
Trainee Ackerman...

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.310
You're being specially moved to rearguard.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.260
Follow me.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.230
B-But I'll only slow them down!

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.620
I'm not asking your opinion.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.750
The evacuation's falling behind.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.790
We need as many skilled soldiers 
overseeing civilians as possible.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.190
B-But...

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:00.910
Hey!

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.780
Enough, Mikasa...

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.300
Don't you freak out, too!

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.670
Humanity is in danger of being wiped out.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.520
What you want doesn't matter!

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.090
I'm sorry.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.410
I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.820
But I do have one request.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.040
Please... Don't die.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.710
I'm not going to die.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.750
I can't die here.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.720
I still have no idea 
what the world is really like.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.620
Surviving historical documents

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.520
say nothing about the Titans' origins.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.880
We know very little about them.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.990
What information we do have comes from

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.990
reports made by the Survey Corps.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.680
There has been no evidence that 
their intelligence approaches our own.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.560
Consequently, attempts to communicate 
with them have been unsuccessful.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.670
The Titan body structure

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.140
differs fundamentally from that of other creatures.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.660
They lack sexual organs, and their 
means of reproduction remains unknown.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.790
However, most appear male.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.140
They have extremely high body temperatures.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.410
And inexplicably, they show no interest 
in any creatures besides humans.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.440
Their sole purpose in life seems to 
be the consumption of humans.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.830
But considering they have survived for more

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.740
than a century in an environment devoid of human life,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:55.340
we can assume they have no need to eat at all.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.380
In other words,

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.040
we believe their goal in feeding isn't 
to gain sustenance, but simply to kill.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.800
As to why they have posed 
such a threat to humanity,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.260
their incredible vitality is the main factor.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.750
Humanity has possessed 
cannon technology since antiquity,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.170
but it has proved insufficient.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.270
Even decapitated Titans will not die.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.640
And while this isn't universally true,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.690
they are capable of regenerating 
their heads within one to two minutes.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.090
No way...

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.280
Just their size is enough of a problem.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.160
Sir, does this mean 
the Titans are invincible?

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.240
They are not.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.900
There is one way to defeat them.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.110
Target this area.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.130
Severe damage here will prevent regeneration,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.390
and the Titan will die.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.230
Thus, we use two swords to rend away their flesh.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.840
If you can strike that vital spot,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.410
you'll kill them before they 
have time to regenerate.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.740
Hey, Armin...

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.660
Isn't this a great chance?

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.280
If we're successful here,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.830
before even joining the Survey Corps,

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:23.860
we'll definitely rise quickly through the ranks!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.200
Yeah, you're right.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.360
Just to be clear,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.540
a lot of people want to join the 
Survey Corps this time around.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.860
You got the best of me earlier, but not anymore.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.310
You think so, Thomas?

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.400
Then let's see who can kill more Titans.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.560
Don't pad your numbers...

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.290
Team 34, advance!

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.650
Support the vanguard!

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.780
Okay, let's go!

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.560
Look at all those Titans!

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.260
The vanguard's been routed!

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.980
What are they doing?

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.020
After all their boasting?

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.090
I never thought this would be easy,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.990
but this is...

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.360
An Aberrant!

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.320
Stop!

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.630
Huh?

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.420
How dare you?!

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:23.800
Eren!

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.520
Stop! Don't go alone!

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.740
Wait!

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.380
I'll avenge Thomas...

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.230
I won't let you get away!

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.190
Eren!

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:50.760
Eren!

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.530
No!

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.210
Please don't!

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.550
Why am I...

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.080
watching my friends be devoured?

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.480
Why

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.510
can't I

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.380
move?

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.990
A...

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.250
Armin...

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.860
Eren!

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.710
Eren!

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.230
Eren!

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.690
What's wrong, Armin?

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:01.760
My grandpa was hiding this...

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.720
A book about the outside world!

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.590
About the outside world?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.020
You aren't supposed to have that!

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.190
The Military Police will arrest you.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:15.020
Forget all that...

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.710
It says that the majority 
of the world is covered

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.150
by a huge body of water called the "sea."

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.090
And it's all saltwater!

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.370
Salt?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.190
No way! Salt's worth a fortune!

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.780
The merchants would take it all.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.570
It's too big to take it all!

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:34.940
There's no way...

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.880
And there's more...

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.220
Flaming water! Frozen earth!

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.420
Plains of sand, white as snow!

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.510
I'm sure the outside world

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.890
is many times bigger than 
the world inside the walls!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.850
The outside world...

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.420
Also...

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.440
This is still a secret, okay?

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.070
But my mom and dad say 
they're going beyond the walls soon.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.910
The outside world!

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.480
Hey, Eren...

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.400
Wouldn't it be great if, one day, 
we could go explore the outside world, too?

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.720
Eren!

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.680
I can't die here...

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.040
Hey, Armin...

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.650
You told me about the outside world.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:44.950
So...

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.620
I'm going out there...

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.950
Eren! Hurry!

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.200
A sudden rainfall.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.370
The quiet sound of rain.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.410
The humid air.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.580
The scent of rain, ever so slightly sweet,

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.040
makes Mikasa remember 
a gruesome event from her past.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.960
The World the Girl Saw 
The Battle for Trost (2)
