00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.990
The World the Girl Saw 
Battle for Trost (2)

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.110
Hey!

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.830
Hey! What's wrong, Armin?

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.990
Wake up!

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.490
Hey!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.120
Armin...

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.540
Come on, Armin!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.330
Come on!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.940
Are you awake?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.080
Are you okay?

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.400
Are you hurt?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.110
What about your team?

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.630
Team?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.220
Get a hold of yourself, man.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.970
Why are you alone?

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.550
And what's this weird slime on you?

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.240
What happened?

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.280
You useless idiot!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.440
D-Die!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.110
Hey...

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.110
Calm down, Armin!

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:15.360
Where is everyone?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.780
That's enough, Connie.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.120
They were all wiped out...

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.220
All except for him.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.700
Shut up!

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.370
Armin didn't say anything about that!

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.290
Just look around you...

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.830
We don't have any more 
time to waste on him.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.540
Why is Armin the only one who made it?

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.090
Who knows.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.020
Maybe they thought he was already dead?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.710
It's unfortunate that they ran into multiple Titans.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.010
What a shame that only this loser survived 
instead of Eren and the others.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.520
Want me to shut that mouth forever, bitch?!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.770
Stop it, both of you!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.110
No one's thinking straight...

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.520
All of our friends are dying so fast.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.570
It would freak anyone out!

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.570
That's my Krista.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.030
Once this operation ends, marry me!

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.450
Sure...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.250
Her antics are even more off the charts than usual.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.420
Anyway, we can't leave you here.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.330
Can you stand, Armin?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220
S-Sorry for causing trouble.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.850
I'll go meet up with the rearguard.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.930
Wait...

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.840
Armin!

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.310
Let's go, Connie!

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.150
We have orders to advance!

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.610
This is hell.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.900
No, it was always hell.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.620
I just never realized it.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.830
This world has always been hell.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.130
The strong devour the weak.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.420
It's almost as if the world's doing us a favor 
by making it so easy to understand.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.880
But, my friends...

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.480
They tried to be strong in this world.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.190
They helped me, who was weak.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.580
I couldn't stand that...

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.070
To those two, I'm someone 
who needs protecting.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.790
I wanted to be strong like them.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.490
To live in this world as their equal!

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.840
And this is the result...

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.430
Eren died because of me.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.820
Hannah, what are you doing?

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.240
Help me, Armin!

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.820
Franz isn't breathing!

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.960
I keep performing CPR, but he won't...

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.250
Franz won't...

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.520
Hannah, it's dangerous down here. 
Get up on the roof—

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.290
I can't just leave him here!

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.460
But, Hannah...

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.970
Franz is...

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.480
Stop it, please...

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.910
No more!

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.580
I can't take any more...

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.000
Hey, do you people have any idea 
what situation we're in?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.040
I do, and that's why we're doing this!

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.500
If you want to live, help us!

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.010
Screw you!

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.280
You can't fit that through!

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.720
You should let the people through first!

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.760
The Titans will eat all of us!

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.510
What are you doing, soldiers?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.100
Arrest them!

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.510
B-But...

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.790
Try it, peon.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.020
I'm boss of the guild here.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.400
Well...

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.750
Who do you think paid for all the 
food you soldiers crapped out?

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.110
Can you get enough money to feed 
all the soldiers in this city?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.160
The rest of you, help push!

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.740
The stuff in here's worth more

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.450
than you'll ever earn in your worthless lives!

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.370
Help out, and I'll pay you!

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.460
It's okay...

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.130
Dad will get the Titans with his cannon.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.880
Mom...

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.380
Look.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.480
Push!

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.230
If you don't want to die, push!

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.730
Please! My child!

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.990
Damn it! Why is it ignoring us?

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.120
It's an Aberrant!

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.240
No point in thinking about it.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.490
It's fast...

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.910
We're the best around, 
and we still can't catch up!

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.160
At this rate...

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.520
What are you doing?

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.610
Perfect!

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.520
You there! Make them help us!

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.030
We'll pay you well!

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.610
Right now,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.950
my friends are dying.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.910
Because the people haven't evacuated,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.520
they're dying, fighting the Titans.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.120
Of course!

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.670
It's your job to sacrifice yourselves

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.710
to protect the people's lives and fortunes.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:08.590
You parasites think you're so special 
just because you're finally being useful

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.300
for the first time in a century?!

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.980
If you expect someone to die 
for the sake of another as a matter of course,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.820
I'm sure you'll understand this.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:31.360
That sometimes a single, 
noble sacrifice can save many lives.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.320
Try it!

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.530
I've known your boss for a long time...

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.950
I can decide your fate with a single word!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.290
How is a corpse going to talk?

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.960
Wait!

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.260
B-Boss...

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.310
Pull the wagon back.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.630
We're saved!

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.610
Thank you!

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:12.150
You saved us.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.860
Thank you!

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.060
Well done, Ackerman...

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.140
I'm impressed.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.940
Thank you, sir.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.400
However,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.230
I was in too much of a hurry. 
I ruined my blades in that one strike.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.690
Next time, I'll be more careful.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.550
What happened to you before all this?

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.200
No, never mind.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.130
Why would I remember that now?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.010
Ultra-Hard Steel (1) 
A material both supple and strong, capable of 
rending Titan flesh. Used to forge the single-edged 
swords widely known as anti-Titan weapons.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:21.010
Ultra-Hard Steel (2) 
Ultra-hard steel can only be manufactured 
in the blast furnaces of factory cities.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.600
The Year: 844

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.520
It's done!

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.060
Look, Mom!

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.190
Oh, good job, Mikasa.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.320
It's wonderful.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.240
This embroidery pattern has been passed 
down in our family for generations.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.040
When you have children of your own, 
teach it to them.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.210
How do you get children?

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.540
Hmm...

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.280
Ask your dad.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.670
Hey, Dad...

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.010
Uh, well... Your dad isn't too sure, either...

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.640
Oh, Doctor Jaeger's on his way over. 
Maybe you should ask him.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.610
Oh!

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.430
Looks like he's here.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.770
Coming!

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.280
Mikasa?

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.240
That's right.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.780
A girl your age.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.160
There aren't any children around here.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.420
Be nice to her.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.580
Depends on how she acts toward me.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.780
Eren...

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.920
This is why you only have one friend.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.420
Are they not here?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.300
Mister Ackerman, it's me, Jaeger.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.530
Excuse us...

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.850
What's wrong?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.560
Hey... Dad?

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.860
She's gone.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.350
Eren, did you see a girl around here?

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.840
Have you seen Mikasa?

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.320
No.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.870
All right...

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.350
I'm going to call the Military Police 
and request a search.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.670
You wait at the base of the mountain.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.710
Understand, Eren?

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.550
Eren?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.230
Hey...

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.310
Can we really sell her?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.230
We killed her parents to get her.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.320
Take a good look at her face.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.160
She's a looker, but she's still a kid.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.620
Not my type.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.870
I wasn't asking about your type.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.620
She's Asian.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.120
Humans used to have races, too...

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.380
She's the last descendant

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:02.130
of a clan that fled from a place called "Asia" 
to take refuge within the walls.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.140
We'll take her to the capital's underworld 
and auction her off to perverts.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.640
The rest of the Asians went extinct...

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.270
She'll fetch a high price.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.600
Her father didn't look Asian.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.150
She isn't a pure-blood.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.940
That's right...

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.960
The mother was the one really worth something!

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.450
And you got scared and killed her!

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.950
I h-had to... She was putting up a fight!

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.290
Is that all you have to say? Huh?!

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.970
Doctor Jaeger, we've been waiting for—

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.560
Excuse us.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:05.150
Stay put if you don't want me 
to split your head wide open.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.570
You bitch!

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.740
Mikasa, run!

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.330
Mom...

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.040
Hurry, Mikasa!

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.040
Um...

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.500
Dad...

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:19.960
Damn it!

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.420
Stop struggling!

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.770
What are you doing?

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.660
I said to just kill the father!

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.770
But the bitch...

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.110
No excuses...

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.480
Grab the girl!

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.780
Hey, you'd better not put up a fight.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.690
Or you know what'll happen!

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.170
It's so cold...

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.850
Excuse me.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.270
Hey, kid!

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.860
How did you find us?

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.910
Um, I got lost in the forest, 
and I saw this house...

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.290
A child shouldn't go walking 
all alone through the forest...

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.960
There are scary wolves in the forest.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.130
But now you don't need to worry!

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.380
Just come with us, and...

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.010
Thanks, mister.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.200
I've learned my lesson.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.060
Die, asshole!

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.690
You're kidding me!

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.280
Wait, you damn brat!

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.240
You animals!

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.540
Die! Die!

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.040
This is what you get!

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.920
This is what you deserve!

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.540
Don't try to stand up again!

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.650
It's safe now...

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.440
Don't worry.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.580
You're Mikasa, right?

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.070
I'm Eren.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.370
Doctor Jaeger's son.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.240
You've met my dad.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.040
My dad and I came to your 
house for the checkup.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.460
And then...

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:09.210
There were three of them.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.350
Did you do this?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.350
Did you kill them? Did you?!

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.570
I'll kill you... I'll kill you!

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.070
Fight...

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.570
Fight!

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.490
If we don't win...

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.740
We'll die...

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.080
If we win, we'll live!

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.080
What are you thinking, you stupid brat?

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.590
If we don't fight, we can't win!

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.550
But I can't...

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.310
And that was when I remembered...

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.270
I'd seen this before...

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.740
so very many times.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.450
I'd seen it again and again,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.290
but...

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.750
I'd always pretended I hadn't.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.880
That's right.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.580
This world

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:40.390
is cruel.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.290
In that instant, my body stopped shaking.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.700
And from then on, I was in 
complete control of myself.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.970
I thought I could do anything.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.780
Fight...

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.290
Fight!

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.790
Fight!

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.970
A single stab to the heart from behind.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.520
Those children did this?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.920
Eren, I told you to wait at 
the base of the mountain.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.530
Do you understand what you've done?

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.280
I got rid of dangerous animals...

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.040
Animals that happened to resemble humans!

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.250
Eren!

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.960
They would've been long gone 
by the time the police arrived.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.540
They wouldn't have got here in time!

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.050
Even if that's true, 
you were just plain lucky, Eren!

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.660
I'm mad because you risked 
your life without thinking!

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.060
But I wanted to save her 
as soon as I could...

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.780
Do you remember me, Mikasa?

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.070
When you were young, 
we met several times.

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.070
Doctor Jaeger...

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.780
Which way should I go...

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.470
to get home from here?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.750
It's cold...

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.500
I don't have

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.510
anywhere to go home to.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.610
You can have this.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.480
It's warm, isn't it?

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.310
It's warm.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.230
Mikasa, come live with us.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.210
You've been through a lot...

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.270
You need lots of rest.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:22.210
What is it?

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.970
Come on, let's go back.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.850
Let's go back to our home.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.270
Okay, let's go home.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:53.590
A cruel world, in which 
only the victor survives.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.000
Pull back, Ackerman.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.870
We'll climb the wall.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.740
I'll help the vanguard withdraw.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.510
Wait, Ackerman!

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.650
But in this world,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.320
I have somewhere to go home to.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.840
Eren...

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.170
As long as I have you,

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.020
I can do anything.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.580
"I have somewhere to go home to."

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.290
After completing her mission with the rear guard,

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.690
Mikasa hurries back to Eren.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.180
But instead, she is told

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.860
that Eren has died.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.310
The Small Blade 
The Battle for Trost (3)
