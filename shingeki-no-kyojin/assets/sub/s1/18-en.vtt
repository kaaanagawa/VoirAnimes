WEBVTT

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.550
We will now begin the 57th 
expedition beyond the walls!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.650
Onward!

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.990
We believe that in the basement of 
Eren Jaeger's Zhiganshina home,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.770
there are answers about the Titans 
that he himself doesn't have.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.790
We will head there.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.020
You new recruits will be here.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.650
You'll be between the cart guard team

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650
and the recon support team.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.550
Your job will be to ride alongside the 
spare horses and relay messages.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.560
The Special Operations 
Squad will be here.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.760
Standing by in the center 
of the last ranks.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.930
It's the safest place in the formation.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.690
Row 5-Center: Standby

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.860
We're even better protected 
than the supply carts.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.780
That's no Aberrant.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.870
It's intelligent!

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.290
Like the Armored or Colossal 
Titans, or Eren...

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.960
A human in the body of a Titan!

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.550
Its movements are much more 
precise than the others' are!

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:13.820
Damn it.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.860
I...

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.380
I underestimated it!

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.260
It protected its neck...

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.510
Damn it! I can't get away!

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.500
Jean!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.250
Avenge the suicidal bastard!

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.400
It stopped?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.990
That's the one...

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.740
That's the one that killed him!

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.560
He rushed to his death 
on the right flank!

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.960
Avenge him!

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.290
We've bought enough time, right?

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.090
Let's get the hell away from it!

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.730
No... Why?

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.360
Is it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.460
heading toward Eren?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.990
Forest of Giant Trees 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (2)

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.210
How's your 3D Maneuver Gear looking, Armin?

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.170
It's okay...

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.710
The clasp released as intended, 
so it seems it's not broken.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.380
I see...

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.630
I'm glad to hear it.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.880
But what do we do?

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.720
We only have one horse.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.390
If Jean's horse comes back, 
the three of us can move, but...

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.270
Damn it, why?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.780
Reiner's horse returned, so why didn't mine?

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.290
We can't stay here any longer.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.620
In the worst case, we'll have 
to leave someone here...

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.210
But how would we decide who to leave?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.420
Armin, since he's wounded?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.250
Reiner, since he's big and would have 
trouble riding with someone else?

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.680
Or should I run and try to find my horse?

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.260
Damn it!

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.220
Why the hell do I have to think about this?!

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.220
We all made it through that fight alive.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.560
This isn't fair...

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.410
Armin...

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.040
Hey, Armin!

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.360
Are you still out of it?

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.130
Yeah, my head's still a bit fuzzy...

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.510
I see...

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.970
But we must decide.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.350
It's a hard choice, but someone 
will have to stay behind.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.440
Wait!

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.860
First, let's fire a smoke round...

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.900
If the formation continued straight ahead,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.650
the row 4-3 team should be nearby.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.950
That's the signal for an emergency...

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.190
But I can't imagine they'll understand 
our intentions just from that.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.830
Armin, we can wait another three minutes.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.750
By then, we must decide—

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.750
I'll stay.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.550
But there's something I want 
you to tell them for me...

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.180
Preferably to Commander Erwin alone—

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.470
No, Armin.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.100
You should tell him yourself.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.310
Looks like someone's here...

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.230
And with two horses!

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.150
That's...

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.820
Krista!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.660
Is everyone okay?

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.290
That's my horse...

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.790
Whoa, whoa.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.470
Calm down, Buchwald.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.410
He ran toward me, terrified...

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.590
Did you engage the Titans?

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.380
Armin, what happened to you?

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.510
Are you okay?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.850
Yeah, I think so.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.430
I can't believe that smoke 
round brought you here.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.350
I was nearby, and I already had Jean's horse.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.860
Even horses like you.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.860
It seems you have a strange charisma.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.360
You saved our lives.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.150
But I'm so glad

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.160
that the worst didn't happen to you.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.450
I really am glad.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.170
God...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.400
A goddess.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.690
I want to marry her.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.510
Well, we should rejoin the 
formation as soon as possible.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.470
Yeah, there should be orders to retreat.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.680
To think we've been pushed back, 
less than an hour out of the walls.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.150
Things are even bleaker 
than I'd imagined...

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.640
And for some reason,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.110
it went in the opposite direction from 
the vanguard command team...

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.070
It?

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.600
A green round?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.280
Looks like they're continuing the operation,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.990
only changing course...

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.520
What?

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.330
That wasn't a retreat command?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.920
What is Commander Erwin thinking?

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.750
In theory, any soldier has 
the authority to determine

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.720
when mission completion 
is no longer possible.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.380
Did command not see our 
smoke round somehow?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.620
Even if we don't know what's going on,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.010
there's still only one thing for us to do...

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.910
Follow the order!

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.400
Smoke round.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.900
Green.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.150
Oluo, you fire it.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.570
Roger.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.030
For now, everything seems to be going fine.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.630
But is it really?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.250
We may already have casualties 
on the front lines.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.290
Reporting!

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.290
Message to pass along!

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.630
Right flank recon has been destroyed!

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.170
Our recon system is partially inoperative.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.550
Pass this on, to the left.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.300
Did you hear that, Petra?

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.600
Go.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.560
Yes, Captain.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.560
The right flank?!

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.350
I think that's where Armin is.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.170
But Armin and the others should still 
be in position, near the center.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.520
The Titans can't have made it in that far...

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:16.860
A black round?

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.700
Aberrants?

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.990
Eren, you fire it.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.320
R-Right!

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.410
What a mess.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.330
We let it penetrate deep into our formation.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.800
It's almost here...

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.170
The Titan.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.260
Beneath those smoke rounds, 
is there someone fighting?

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.770
Damn it...

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.570
Look over here.

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.860
You monster...

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.580
Now!

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.810
Three separate attacks at once...

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.590
You're pretty smart, but you can't 
possibly protect all three targets!

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.550
Spine, Achilles tendon...

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.880
It doesn't matter!

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.970
Hit one, and we will slow it down...

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.640
Go!

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.060
Damn you for causing so many deaths!

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.060
We'll make you die a slow, painful death!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.610
It jumped?

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.580
L-Let me go!

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.200
The most important thing is 
to ensure they hear of this...

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.580
I must tell them what we're up against!

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.090
An Aberrant?!

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.840
It got in all the way here?

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.290
We'll take it out!

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.670
We can't let it penetrate any farther!

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.740
The right flank's been wiped out?

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.350
But we aren't withdrawing?

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:06.770
Row 3-1: Cargo

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.240
Why?!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.490
No idea...

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.950
The Commander's orders...

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.780
Just relay the message to the left!

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.090
What's going on?

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:24.080
Row 1-13: Recon

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.210
We keep heading east.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.090
Our goal is supposed to 
be south, to the old city.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.840
Row 1-5: Recon

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.010
Right now, our formation's on a collision course.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:28.850
Yeah.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.680
You can see it...

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.190
The forest of giant trees!

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.990
Forest of Giant Trees (1) 
Isolated forests of giant trees can be 
found within and beyond the walls. 
They occur naturally in certain areas, 
and tree heights can exceed 80 meters.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.990
Forest of Giant Trees (2) 
Before Wall Maria's fall, this particular forest was a tourist area. 
Now, it is a strategically important location used by the Survey 
Corps to protect themselves from Titans during expeditions.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.870
Seems Titans passed through here.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.460
There's nothing growing on the road.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.510
We can bring the carts through, too.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.580
Send word to the rear

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.930
that only the central cart guard 
should enter the forest.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.890
Yes, sir!

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.310
Excuse me, sir...

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.770
The center row appears to 
be entering the forest,

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:33.890
but wouldn't the rest of 
us collide with the forest?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.580
We're going around.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.400
Yes, sir!

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.760
Hey, what are we doing at this tourist spot?

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.470
We're totally off from both our original 
destination and our return point.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.260
I don't know...

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.190
I don't know, but the order came from 
Commander Erwin, after all.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.900
He must have a plan.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.230
What kind of plan?

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.780
Are they planning to hold a welcome ceremony

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.060
for us new recruits at a tourist spot?

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.610
No, I don't think so.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.740
That was a joke.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.830
Anyway, that giant woman's following us.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.500
No matter what his plan, we can't stay here.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.670
The only thing I can imagine

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.630
is that we're passing through 
on our way to somewhere else...

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:25.630
Everyone, halt!

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.850
All right. Listen up, recruits.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.850
We will now make preparations 
to launch a counterattack.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.850
Draw your blades, and wait above in the trees.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.850
If any Titans try to enter this forest, 
stop them at all costs!

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.420
U-Um, sir, what do you—

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.030
Shut up and follow orders!

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.100
Seriously?

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.700
What's going on?

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.880
H-Hey, it looks like only the center 
line went into the woods.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.390
What happened to the formation?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.550
It's gone.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.000
The forest blocks our advance,
 so the left and right flanks

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.140
will have to skirt the forest.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.640
We've lost our recon ability.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.640
Why didn't we change course 
to avoid this forest?

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.810
Did Commander Erwin read the map wrong?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.680
I don't know...

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.940
Perhaps we tried too hard to avoid the threat

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.520
on the right flank and ended up here...

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.080
This is insane...

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.590
We've abandoned the original 
mission to cache supplies.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.630
And when we abandoned it, 
we should've turned tail and run...

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.840
But instead, we're forging 
ahead to a tourist trap.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.220
And now, we're just standing here,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.060
to stop any Titans that enter the woods?

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.400
Damn him for giving a crazy order.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.190
He'll hear you...

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.030
And this no real explanation 
thing is innovative, too.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.080
Of course, I'm sure he has his own concerns...

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.410
What do you mean?

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.350
A commander deemed worthless 
by his men in a critical situation

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.290
quite often succumbs to a 
mysterious attack from behind.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.420
I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.680
Jean, so what are you going to do?

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.300
Don't be so serious...

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.430
This situation's got me a 
bit worked up, that's all.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.030
What am I going to do?

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.730
Obey my orders, and keep 
Titans out of the forest.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.730
You also think it's the right move, don't you?

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.690
Ah—

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.490
You look like you know something.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.490
Well...

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.610
Five-meter class incoming!

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:09.640
Why bring the formation here?

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.720
What is Commander Erwin thinking?

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.220
No, that isn't what 
we should think about.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.310
The Female Titan is pursuing Eren.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.230
And the Commander knows that.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.230
Assume those two things, 
and see what you can deduce...

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.520
Captain...

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.150
Captain Levi!

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.690
What?

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.450
Well...

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.010
We're in the middle of the woods!

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.240
If the center enters alone,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.290
we won't know if Titans are approaching!

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.830
It seems something's approaching us from the right...

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.130
How are we supposed to dodge 
the Titans or protect the carts?

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.050
Don't go on and on about the obvious...

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.720
We can't do that anymore, of course.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.380
Th-Then why?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.550
Look around, Eren...

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.140
At all these big-ass trees.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.350
It's the perfect environment 
for 3D Maneuver Gear.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.800
And try to use that tiny brain of yours...

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.990
If you don't want to die, think.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:18.610
Yes, sir!

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.910
I see.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:24.720
I just can't keep up right now 
because I'm still new.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.780
He won't just tell me the answer.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.160
I have to figure it out for myself.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.590
I'm sure that's how they all learned to fight.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.110
What the hell?

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.680
Seriously?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.680
Damn it all... What the hell is going on here?

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.560
Wait!

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:53.330
Wait a minute... No one knows 
what's really going on?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.270
Maybe not even Captain Levi?

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.240
The Female Titan is after Eren...

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:04.870
If I'm right about that,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.080
then there's only one reason to come here.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.920
This is where Commander Erwin intends 
to deal with the Female Titan...

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.960
Armin...

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:19.010
Our orders were to keep the 
Titans out of the forest, right?

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.220
In other words...

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.020
There's no longer any reason to fight...

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.310
Right?

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.640
A black smoke round?

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.260
It's from directly behind us!

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.940
It's whatever was coming 
toward us on the right.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.100
Draw your blades.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.860
If we see it, it'll only be for a second.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:42.960
Go!

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.940
It's fast!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.940
In these trees, there's no way to 
foresee and evade its attacks!

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.990
It'll catch us!

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.160
Captain, let's switch to Maneuver Gear!

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.820
Captain!

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.660
You won't escape!

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.660
Reinforcements from the rear!

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.560
Captain, your orders?!

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.810
Let's go for it!

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.060
It's dangerous...

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.480
We should kill it!

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.610
I'll rip you apart!

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.780
Fool, you've run straight into hell.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.940
You're chasing a group of master Titan killers!

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.010
Captain Levi?

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.160
Captain!

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.770
Give us your orders.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.980
At this rate, it <i>will</i> catch up with us!

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.430
We kill it here...

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.370
That's why we came to this forest!

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.300
Right, Captain?

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.340
Captain, your orders!

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.800
Everyone, cover your ears.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.000
The Female Titan continues its pursuit,
 leaving carnage in its wake.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.120
Despite witnessing their 
friends being slaughtered

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.570
before their very eyes, 
the Survey Corps can only flee.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.060
Eren is faced with a decision.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.870
