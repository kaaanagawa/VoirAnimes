00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.250
That day, humanity remembered...

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.180
the terror of being ruled by them.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.240
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.410
Prepare for combat!

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.460
We have one target...

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.890
Defeat it, and make this humanity's 
first base outside the walls.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.300
Target approaching!

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.580
Split into five groups, just as we practiced!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.560
We'll be the decoys!

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.350
Attack teams, switch to 
Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear!

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.590
We'll strike from all directions at once!

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.640
We'll show you the power

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.930
of humanity!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.990
To You, 2,000 Years in the Future 
The Fall of Zhiganshina (1)

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.150
Huh? Mikasa...

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.430
Let's head back.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.850
What am I doing here?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.800
You're so out of it. 
Were you sound asleep?

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.000
No...

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.700
It's just, I feel like I had a really long dream.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.390
What was it about?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.380
I can't remember...

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.670
Eren, why are you crying?

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.590
The Year: 845 — Zhiganshina District

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.000
Listen!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.350
These walls were constructed with God's wisdom!

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.560
They were given to us by God himself!

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.090
None may defile them!

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.320
Don't tell anyone that I was crying.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.570
I won't...

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.580
But if you're crying for no reason,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.080
why not have your dad check you over?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.540
No way!

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.830
I can't tell my dad about it.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.960
What are you crying over, Eren?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.150
Hannes!

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.720
Did Mikasa get mad at you for something?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.170
Why would that make me cry?

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.580
And you stink of alcohol!

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.280
Oh, come on...

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.240
You're all drinking again?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.230
Why don't you join us?

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.920
Um, but don't you have work?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.980
Yeah! We're guarding the gate today.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.580
We spend all day here, so eventually, 
we get hungry and thirsty.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.340
And the fact that some of what 
we drink may be alcohol...

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.370
Well, that isn't too big a problem.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.210
Can you fight like that if you have to?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.350
If we have to? When would we...

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.300
When else?!

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.760
If they breached the walls 
and entered the city!

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.030
Ow...

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.420
Hey, Eren, don't yell like that...

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.020
The doctor's son is pretty lively today.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.630
If they ever do breach 
the walls, we'll do our jobs.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.080
But that hasn't happened 
for a hundred years.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.050
But my dad says that you're in the most danger

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.390
when you lower your guard!

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.930
Doctor Jaeger, huh?

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.040
Well, he's right...

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.730
He once saved the whole city from an epidemic.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.650
We owe him more than we could ever repay.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.920
But that has nothing to do with them.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.080
As a soldier, when you go up to repair the walls,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.350
you can sometimes see them, 
wandering around outside.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.640
But this wall is fifty meters high. 
They can't do anything about it.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.270
Th-Then,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.900
you're actually not prepared to fight them?

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.180
Nope.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.540
What?!

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.880
Then stop calling yourselves the Garrison, 
and become the Wall Repair Corps!

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.700
I wouldn't mind that...

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.870
But listen, Eren...

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.710
If we're fighting, 
it means things are bad.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.800
As long as everyone's laughing at us 
and calling us useless freeloaders,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.880
that means we're all safe.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.400
Even if we can never leave 
these walls for our entire lives,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.640
as long as we eat and sleep, we'll survive...

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.570
But that makes us just like...

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.190
Just like cattle!

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.750
That's a brave kid you have there.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.920
Not like he could do anything 
about it, huh, Hannes?

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.850
Y-Yeah.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.470
Hey, Eren!

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.540
Strange kid.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.590
Does he want to join the Survey Corps?

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.870
Eren, you should stop considering the Survey Corps.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.250
What? You're going to tell 
me they're stupid, too?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.160
That isn't it...

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.240
The Survey Corps is back!

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.200
The front gate's opening!

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.250
Let's go, Mikasa!

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.630
The heroes are back!

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.640
Damn it, I can't see!

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.690
These are all that made it back?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.090
Everyone else must've been eaten.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.200
That's what happens when 
you go outside the walls.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.090
Moses! Moses!

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.440
Um, my son, Moses... I don't see him.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.470
Where is he?

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.710
This is Moses's mother.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.290
Bring it.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.180
That is all we managed to retrieve.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.020
But my son...

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.900
He helped, right?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.250
Even if he didn't do anything directly...

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.040
My son's death helped humanity

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.540
fight back, didn't it?!

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.160
Of course!

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.120
No.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.520
Our recon this time didn't...

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.680
No,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.330
we never...

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.670
Never learn a thing!

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.690
It's my fault...

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.370
My own incompetence killed our men!

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:27.640
And we still don't even know what they are!

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.230
What a mess...

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.550
You've got that right.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.350
It's like our taxes all go to fatten them up.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.540
What are you doing, stupid brat?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.850
Hey!

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.440
What are you doing, Mikasa?!

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.980
Get back here!

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.360
Mikasa, you can let go now!

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.230
What was that for?

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.100
The firewood spilled everywhere!

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:09.370
Eren,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.210
do you still want to join the Survey Corps?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.780
Help me pick these up...

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.870
There isn't enough to bother.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.980
Information We Can Share So Far: 
About the Walls (1) 
Humanity lives within three walls. 
The outermost is Wall Maria. 
The second, Wall Rose. 
The innermost is Wall Sina.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.980
Information We Can Share So Far: 
About the Walls (2) 
Distance between each is roughly the same. 
100km separate Maria and Rose. 
130km separate Rose and Sina. 
From Sina to the center is about 250km.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.450
Back.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.600
Welcome home.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.160
Oh, Eren!

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.500
You actually worked hard for a change.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.210
Yeah...

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.870
What?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.530
Your ears turned red.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.340
That means you're lying.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.590
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.320
Huh? Are you going somewhere, Dad?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960
Work?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.580
Yes, I'm going inland to see patients.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.290
Probably for two or three days.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.610
Eren said he wants to join the Survey Corps.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.320
M-Mikasa, I told you not to tell them!

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:28.990
Eren!

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.370
What are you thinking?

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.310
Do you know how many people 
have died outside the walls?

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.960
I do!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.000
In that case...

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.900
Eren...

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.380
Why do you want to go outside?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.760
I want to know what it's like out there.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.130
I don't want to spend my life inside 
the walls, not knowing anything!

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.770
Also...

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.900
If no one carries on their work,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.400
all the casualties till now will have been in vain!

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:06.860
I see.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.140
The ship is waiting.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.580
I'll be going now.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.050
Wait...

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:14.450
You need to talk to Eren!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.020
Karla, human curiosity is not something

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.890
you can restrain with a lecture.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.340
Eren...

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.170
When I get back,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.840
I'll show you what I've kept secret 
in the basement all this time.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.260
R-Really?

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.810
Bye!

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.290
I won't let you.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.600
Joining the Survey Corps? 
Don't be stupid.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.650
Huh? Stupid?!

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.760
I think people who're fine being cattle

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.360
are way more stupid!

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.850
Eren!

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.120
Mikasa,

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.820
sometimes he doesn't think things through.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.710
When you're in trouble, 
you must help one another.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.190
Okay.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.880
What's wrong, heretic?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.850
If you don't like it, hit back!

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.810
No way.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.110
That would put me on your level!

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.100
What?!

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.390
You know what I said is true.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.270
That's why you're hitting me instead of arguing.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:28.420
Doesn't that mean you admit I win?

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.080
Shut your damned mouth!

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.560
Stop it!

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.240
That's Eren!

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.760
The fool's back.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.090
He wants to get his ass kicked?

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:41.430
Let's give him what he wants!

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.590
M-Mikasa's here, too!

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.010
N-No... Let's get out of here!

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.240
They ran away when they saw me!

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.950
No, they ran when they saw Mikasa.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.860
Ouch...

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.440
Hey, are you okay, Armin?

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.360
I can stand on my own.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.320
All right.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.360
So I said that humanity should 
go out into the world someday.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.650
And they hit me and called me a heretic.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.710
Damn it.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.640
Why does everyone act like you're 
crazy if you want to go outside?

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.790
Because staying within the walls has 
brought peace for a hundred years.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.100
They're afraid that if many of us 
venture out, we'll risk letting them in.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.980
So the royal government declared 
any interest in the outside world taboo.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.730
That's our lives we're risking, 
so it's our business!

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.190
You can't.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.430
No.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.920
Come to think of it, why did you tell my parents?

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.580
I don't remember ever saying I'd help.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.910
H-How did it go?

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.580
Well... They weren't happy.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.420
I bet.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.670
But you're right.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:17.470
I wonder about those who think staying 
inside the walls will protect us forever.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.980
Mom!

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.520
Just because the walls haven't 
been breached in a hundred years

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.450
doesn't mean they won't be

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.750
breached today...

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.590
What?

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.640
An explosion?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.670
Over there!

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.130
I think something fell from the sky!

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.070
Hey, Armin!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.180
What's wrong?

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.520
What can you see?

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.110
No way...

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.620
That wall

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.450
is fifty meters tall!

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.950
It's one of them...

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.250
A Titan!

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.890
It broke...

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.890
a hole in the wall...

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.890
They're coming inside!

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.650
The Titans are getting inside!

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.420
We have to get out of here!

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.900
Eren!

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.650
My house is over there...

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.410
My mom!

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.660
Mikasa!

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.540
It's all over...

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.750
The Titans are going

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.510
to take the city!

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.000
Nothing hit my house!

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.810
Once I turn that corner,

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.730
my house will still be there!

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.450
Mom!

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.070
Mom!

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.840
Eren...

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.740
Mikasa, grab that side!

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.090
We have to get this off her!

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.430
Hurry, Mikasa!

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.350
I know.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.790
The Titans are inside, aren't they?

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.850
Eren, take Mikasa and run!

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.070
Now!

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.860
I want to run!

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.970
So hurry and get out of there!

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.820
My legs were crushed by the rubble.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.980
Even if I get out, I can't run.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.340
You understand, don't you?

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.320
Then I'll carry you!

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.660
Why do you never listen to me?!

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.820
At least listen this one last time!

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.500
Mikasa!

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.810
No...

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.120
No!

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.050
If you don't go, all three of us will...

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.900
Hannes!

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.520
Take the children and run!

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.080
Don't underestimate me, Karla.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.370
I'll defeat the Titan, and save you all!

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.010
Wait!

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.440
Don't try to fight it!

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.290
She's right.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.110
If it were just the kids, I could save them.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:50.070
But I'm going to repay that family 
for what they've done for me!

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.410
Wait, Hannes!

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.260
What are you doing?!

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.770
Thank you.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.520
My mom is still back there!

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.440
Eren! Mikasa!

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.390
You must survive!

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.790
Don't go...

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.930
Stop!

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.000
That day, humanity remembered...

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.760
<i>the terror of being ruled by them.</i>

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.800
<i>The humiliation of being kept in a cage.</i>

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.670
The Fall of Zhiganshina.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.830
All humanity could do 
was pray, scream, and die...

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.330
Among them, Eren was

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:06.550
the only one to swear revenge.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.960
That Day 
The Fall of Zhiganshina (2)
