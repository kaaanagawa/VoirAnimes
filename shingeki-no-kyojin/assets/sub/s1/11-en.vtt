WEBVTT

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.980
The year 850, in Trost...

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.350
The sight of Eren Jaeger unleashing

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.030
the power of a mysterious Titan

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.890
was more than enough to 
terrify his fellow soldiers.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.260
I am a human!

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.460
He is not an enemy of humanity!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.710
With my final breath before my death,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.460
I shall wish for humanity's glory,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.280
and try to persuade you 
of his strategic value!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.890
As Eren and his friends could do nothing 
but argue their innocence,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.000
they were saved by Dot Pixis,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660
the high commander of the 
southern territories.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.210
I think we should listen to them...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Icon 
The Battle for Trost (7)

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.380
I'll do it!

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.840
I don't know whether 
I can seal the hole.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.340
But I'll do it!

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.170
Well said.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.560
You're a real man.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.860
I'll call my strategists. 
We'll develop a plan!

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.730
No way.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.030
That idea depends on 
so many assumptions,

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.860
and he's just going to run with it?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.120
I was just thinking the same thing.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.310
But there's no sense in 
doubting his decision.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.370
Commander Pixis must see potential 
in something the rest of us can't see.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.840
Something we can't see?

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.660
Also, I think there's a bigger 
issue that must be addressed

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.600
before the plan can be executed.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.000
And the Commander fully recognizes it.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.640
What do you mean?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.770
The Titans aren't our only enemy.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.770
There's no time to waste.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.280
I will need your help, young soldiers.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.860
A plan to retake Trost?

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.990
You're kidding...

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.340
We have no way to seal that hole.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.440
What is the brass thinking?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.390
Going into Trost would be our deaths!

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.050
Since we can't seal the hole,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.710
all we can do is die 
defending Wall Rose's gate.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.930
Damn it... They want glory that much?

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.990
I have to return to that hell?

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.480
No! I don't want to die!

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.580
Let me see my family!

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.300
Hey, Daz, you're being too loud...

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.490
You there! I heard you!

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.300
Are you saying you want to 
abandon your mission?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.530
That's right!

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.250
This is nothing but mass suicide! 
It's meaningless!

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.830
Have you no respect for 
humanity? For order?

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.670
If I chose to, I could 
execute you this minute.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.660
Go ahead...

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.440
It's a hundred times better 
than being eaten by Titans!

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.720
Stop it, Daz!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.210
No! Let me go!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.430
I won't go back there!

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.060
Did you hear that?

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.440
Given the circumstances, 
I don't blame him...

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.980
Hey...

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.270
I hope someone rebels over here, too.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.150
I'd at least like to choose how I die.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.160
Hey!

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.450
I-It was a joke!

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.820
Do it...

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.030
Be loud...

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.660
And get others to go along!

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.460
In the Garrison, plenty of 
us aren't happy, either.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.000
We'll take advantage 
of the chaos and leave!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.550
Leave and go where?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.590
To see my daughter.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.500
Eventually, this wall will also fall.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.470
They say that before Titans gained 
dominion over the earth,

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.670
there was endless slaughter of human life

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.070
in wars over race and ideology...

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.780
Then someone said,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.030
"If a powerful external 
threat were to appear,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.030
humanity would cease 
its wars and unite."

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.910
What do you think of that?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.790
I've never heard that legend.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.130
Sounds naïve...

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.730
Almost silly.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.260
You have a warped mind like mine.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.370
Even when that powerful threat

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.450
has pushed us to the 
brink of destruction,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.890
we still have yet to unite.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.710
No, but it's high time we did so.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.720
Otherwise, we won't 
even be able to fight.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.440
Eren?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.120
He's safe, huh?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.540
Focus on the mission?

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.290
How dare he address a 
superior officer that way?

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.420
By the look of it, Mikasa and 
Armin must be safe, as well.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.290
But what's Eren doing 
with the Commander?

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.320
You want some?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.190
Yes, please!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.270
Kill me!

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.820
If you're going to 
execute me, do it now!

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.780
You're sure? I'll do it!

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.750
Attention!

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.640
I shall now explain the 
plan to retake Trost.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.640
For this mission, our objective

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.400
is to seal the hole where 
the gate was destroyed.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.270
Seal it?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.280
How?

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.160
Let me introduce you to the one

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.250
who will seal the hole for us...

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.520
From the Trainee Corps, Eren Jaeger.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.090
E-Eren!

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.880
He is the result of a top-secret project

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.750
to turn humans into Titans.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:17.340
He can create and 
control a Titan's body.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.650
Hey...

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.160
I have no idea what the 
Commander's talking about.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.440
Am I just too stupid to get it or something?

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.820
Would you shut up, idiot?

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.870
He will become a Titan,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.910
pick up the giant boulder 
by the shattered gate,

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.380
carry it over, and seal the hole.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.370
Your job will be

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:46.700
to protect him from Titans 
while he moves the boulder!

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.630
We don't have to fight the Titans?

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.520
E-Excuse me.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.280
I don't mean any disrespect by 
speaking up to a ranking officer...

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.500
No, continue.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.890
Y-Yes, sir.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.390
Titans are typically drawn to pursue
the largest number of people.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.540
If we can take advantage of that

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.520
to lure them along the walls,

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.290
we can draw most of them away from Eren

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.900
without engaging them in direct combat.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.920
And by using the cannons against those

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.410
lured away, we'll 
minimize our own losses.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.600
But since we can't 
leave Eren undefended,

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.770
a small elite force should protect him.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.690
And we can't avoid engaging the 
Titans that come through the wall.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.320
The skills of the elite 
force will be critical.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.190
All right, understood.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.930
We'll take that into account 
and revise our plans.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:42.530
But this will only work if 
Eren can carry that boulder

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.680
and seal the hole.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.950
We are proceeding with the operation 
without certain proof that he can.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.440
I cannot help but feel doubt.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.040
Indeed, given the uncertainty 
of a crucial element,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.990
I do not relish sending many 
men to their deaths.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.970
But I do understand what 
Commander Pixis is thinking.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.340
Yes...

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.950
The first issue is one of time.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.250
Even as we speak, Titans continue 
to enter the town.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:15.120
The greater their numbers in Trost, 
the worse our odds of success in retaking it.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.950
And the higher the chance 
of Wall Rose falling...

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.110
And one more thing.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.420
There's a limit to how much one 
can be motivated by terror.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.360
Lift that giant rock?

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.080
Is it possible?

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.410
Has humanity finally learned 
to control the Titans?

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.910
You're lying!

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.280
I won't put my life on the line for 
a plan I can't even understand!

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.010
What do you think we are?

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.100
We aren't...

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.540
We aren't pawns for you to sacrifice!

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.590
A human weapon?

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.310
He's lying!

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.350
He thinks we're fools!

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.270
He's telling us to die here, today!

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.480
I'm leaving!

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.110
Me, too.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.220
And me!

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.030
I'm out of here, as well!

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.160
Wait!

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.940
You'll get the death penalty for this!

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.860
I'll spend humanity's last 
hours with my family!

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.210
This is bad.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.210
Yes.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.360
If we don't do something, 
there will be chaos.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.030
Ready to die, traitors?!

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.950
I'll kill you right now!

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.740
Here is my decision!

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.500
I shall pardon anyone who deserts now.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.090
Once you succumb to the Titans' fear,

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.060
you can never fight them again.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:41.730
Those who have learned 
that fear should leave.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.910
And anyone wishing their 
parents, siblings,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.640
and loved ones to feel that 
fear should also leave!

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.520
Daddy!

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.780
I can't do that...

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.530
My daughter is my...

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:13.950
My last hope.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.550
Let me tell you what 
happened four years ago.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.710
About our attempt to retake Wall Maria.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.900
As I'm sure you're all aware,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.680
that operation was no more 
than the government's way

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.800
of dealing with its inability 
to feed all of the unemployed.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.310
It was a culling.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.440
The reason no one speaks 
of it is because

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.190
by sending them outside 
these cramped walls,

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.410
we were able to survive within them.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.210
All of humanity, including myself, 
bears the weight of that sin!

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.670
Because so few escaped Wall Maria,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:00.960
there was never any open rebellion.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.730
But what about now?

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.790
If Wall Rose falls,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.150
the sacrifice will be more 
than just twenty percent.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.950
The territory within Wall Sina

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.590
won't support even half 
the remaining population.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.250
If humanity falls,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.750
it won't be because we were 
devoured by the Titans.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.730
It will be because we killed each other.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.170
We must not die even 
deeper within the walls.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.200
I beg of you

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.510
to die right here!

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.580
I don't know if I can use the 
Titan's power to lift that boulder.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.430
But I understand what I must do...

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.440
It may be a lie,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.960
but I must make it happen anyway.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.530
I must become a symbol

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.760
of hope for everyone!

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.950
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.950
3D Maneuver Gear Weight-Shifting Device (1) 
To maneuver in 3D space, it's necessary 
to be able to shift one's weight precisely, 
using belts strung all over the body.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.960
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:19.960
3D Maneuver Gear Weight-Shifting Device (2) 
To allow quick maneuvers in 
3D space, the equipment has 
been made as light as possible.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.460
I see you're all here...

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.890
You have one mission.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.470
To guard Eren Jaeger,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.340
eliminating any threat that 
appears during the operation.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.070
It will be the most dangerous and 
difficult task in the entire operation.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.380
It's no exaggeration

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.950
to say that humanity's fate 
rests on your shoulders.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.790
Commander, may I say something?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.990
What is it?

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.280
Does this human weapon really work?

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.300
Quiet, Riko!

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.750
You don't believe it, either, do you?

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.910
Commander, this operation 
depends on Eren Jaeger,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.500
and we know nothing about him.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.840
If he cannot function, many soldiers 
will have died for nothing.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.010
Well, then...

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.260
Do you really enjoy losing to 
the Titans that much?

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.970
I don't.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.800
I hate losing more than anything.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.280
But unfortunately, I've been 
losing for my entire life.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.500
I want to win against the Titans...

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.230
I want to beat those giant freaks

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.660
more than anything in the world.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.250
S-So do we!

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.880
Then betting on him is our only option.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.760
You're right, we know nothing about him.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.970
But he's the only chance we 
have to defeat the Titans.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.970
Commander, it's time for the 
decoy operation to begin.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.980
Ian Dietrich,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.850
Riko Brzenska,

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.460
Mitabi Jarnach...

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.230
You are the Garrison's 
most elite troops.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.400
I'm entrusting humanity's fate to you.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.830
Yes, sir!

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.180
Ian, you take command.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.950
You have full authority out there.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.960
Me?

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.900
I have no objections.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.810
Nor do I.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.610
But I'm not capable...

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.710
Don't worry.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.970
You're a man who knows his drinks.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.660
You're well-acquainted with 
drink both bitter and sweet.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:39.970
I'm counting on you!

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:42.730
Yes, sir!

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.960
Eren, I'm sorry...

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.290
I ended up making you 
responsible for everything.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.950
It's like I said before.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.990
You have the ability to 
find the right answer.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.030
I believe in that.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.830
Eren, I'm going to—

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.370
Don't tell me you're going 
to come with me.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.770
You've been assigned to the decoy team.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.000
But I can't leave you alone...

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.980
If you're alone, you'll—

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.300
Enough!

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.690
I'm not your little 
brother or a child...

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.090
I told you that!

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.870
Ackerman,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.450
join the elite force protecting Jaeger.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.590
We need your skill.

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.260
Let's go... It's time!

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:31.820
Bye, Armin.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.440
Don't die.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.650
Yeah, you neither.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.050
A top-secret human weapon, was it?

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.130
As long as you can seal that hole, 
it doesn't matter.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.760
Our priority is to protect you.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.880
We're counting on you.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.550
Yes, sir!

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.550
Eren, are you feeling okay?

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.560
Yeah!

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.000
Eren...

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I said I'm fine!

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.450
Much better than when 
we were surrounded.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.370
We aren't playing house here, Jaeger.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.570
I didn't mean...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.070
I can't believe we have to

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.740
leave humanity's fate up 
to a spoiled kid like you.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.310
Enough, guys!

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.990
We'll soon reach the shortest 
route to the boulder.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.800
I'm not seeing any Titans...

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.440
Everyone must have succeeded 
in luring them away.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.160
Listen!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.550
You only need to get them 
to the edge of town!

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.640
Avoid unnecessary combat!

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.060
Listen, Jaeger.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.300
During this operation, 
more than just a few will die.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.980
For you.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.810
They will be our fellows, 
ranked both above and below us.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.320
As soldiers, they're 
prepared to die, of course.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.080
But they are not pawns without a voice.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.580
Wait.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.460
Not yet.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.380
A little more...

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.430
Go!

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.420
They have names and families.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.100
And all the feelings that those entail.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:35.000
Alyosha, Dominic, Phine, Isabel,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.570
Ludwig, Martina, Guido, Hans...

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.780
They're all humans as 
alive as either of us.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.360
I've known some of them 
since my trainee days.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.170
And today, many will die for you.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:58.410
You have a responsibility to ensure that 
their deaths will mean something.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.720
No matter what happens.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.920
Never let yourself forget that.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.680
And be prepared to die 
for that responsibility.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.480
Right!

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.590
I'll do it...

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.980
I'll make this happen!

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.980
Since the Titans appeared, 
humanity has never won against them.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.880
Their continuous advance has meant

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.370
humanity's continuous retreat 
and loss of territory.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.580
But when this mission succeeds,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.440
humanity will have retaken 
its territory from them

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.730
for the very first time.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.520
Right here.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.130
Let's go!

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:51.520
This will be humanity's first 
victory against the Titans!

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.410
Green smoke round, confirmed.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.590
The elite force has begun the mission.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:16.790
Compared to all that humanity has lost, 
it may seem insignificant.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:25.240
But for humanity, that step will be a great 
advance in our attack on the Titans!

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.500
I doubt a human of that size

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.710
could lift that boulder.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.510
But I believe Eren has the 
strength to lead us forward...

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.720
Eren?

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.010
The operation to retake Trost has begun.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.950
As many soldiers die,

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.170
Eren, now a Titan, loses control

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.490
and destroys his own head.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.080
The operation seems 
to have failed, but...

00:24:03.980 --> 00:27:39.630
Wound 
The Battle for Trost (8)
