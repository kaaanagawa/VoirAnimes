WEBVTT

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.350
Draw your blades.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.470
If we see it, it'll only be for a second.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.490
Go!

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.300
It's fast!

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.290
In these trees, there's no way to 
foresee and evade its attacks!

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.340
It'll catch us!

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.510
Captain, let's switch to Maneuver Gear!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.390
Captain!

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.890
You won't escape!

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.820
Reinforcements from the rear!

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.620
Captain, your orders?!

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.790
Let's go for it!

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.290
It's dangerous...

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990
We should kill it!

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.780
At this rate, it <i>will</i> catch up with us!

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.920
We kill it here...

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.200
That's why we came to this forest!

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.180
Right, Captain?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.290
Captain, your orders!

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.500
Everyone, cover your ears.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Bite 
 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (3)

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.510
A noise grenade?

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.160
What is your job?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.520
To just let yourself be swayed by whatever 
you're feeling at the moment?

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.700
No, it's not.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.520
Our squad's job

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.660
is to keep the brat from getting 
a single scratch on him.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.030
Even if it costs our lives.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.160
It wasn't to keep watch on me?

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.830
We keep going on our horses, got it?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.140
Roger!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.170
Keep going? For how long?

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.400
And it's right on top of us...

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.180
Again!

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.970
The reinforcements!

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.430
If we don't help, they'll be wiped out again!

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.270
Eren, eyes on the road!

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.480
Sir!

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.560
Keep your pace up...

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.100
Stay at top speed!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.940
But, sir...

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.890
Why?!

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.490
If Squad Levi doesn't defeat it, who will?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.160
Another one's dead...

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.160
And maybe we could've saved him!

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.580
One's still fighting...

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.920
We could still make it!

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.250
Eren, eyes back on the road! Keep going!

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.340
Are you telling me to look away?

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.300
To abandon my comrades and run?!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.800
Yes, that's right!

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.510
Obey the Captain's orders!

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.850
I don't understand why we're leaving them to die!

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.660
Or why he won't explain!

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.520
Why?!

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.940
That's because the Captain decided 
the reason should not be explained.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.900
You just don't understand because you're still green!

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.760
If you get it, then shut up and obey!

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.780
No...

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.000
I can fight on my own.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.130
Why am I relying on others?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.800
I can just fight on my own.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.090
What are you doing, Eren?

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.140
You're only allowed to do that 
if your life is in danger.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.810
You promised us!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.020
Eren!

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.150
You aren't wrong.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.320
If you want to, do it.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.560
I can tell.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.580
He's a real monster.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.410
And it has nothing to do with his Titan power.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.850
No matter what power you use to suppress him,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.130
no matter what cage you put him in,

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.500
he will never submit to anyone.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.840
I just want to slaughter the Titans.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.720
Eren, the difference between your 
decision and ours is experience.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.480
But you don't have to rely on that.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.820
Choose.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.360
Believe in yourself.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.200
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.660
I don't know...

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.190
I never have.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.540
I can believe in my own abilities

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.380
or the choices of companions I trust.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.880
But no one ever knows how it will turn out.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.590
So choose for yourself whichever 
decision you'll regret least.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.150
Eren!

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.570
Have faith!

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.240
I came up with a way that'd only half-kill you.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.300
Sir?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.290
I said I'd only be able to stop 
you as a Titan if I killed you.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.180
But this method would only badly wound you.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.220
Of course, it relies on the squad's skill.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.420
The idea is to cut you right out of the Titan's neck.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.810
We'd end up cutting the ends 
of your arms and legs off,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.380
but they'd just grow back like a lizard's...

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.650
Creepy, really.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.410
Wait.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.990
I don't know how they grow back.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.620
Is there some other way...

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.300
So you're saying you don't want there 
to be any danger or sacrifice?

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.000
N-No...

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.840
Then just resolve yourself.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.680
We will, too...

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.250
The danger for us is that you might kill us.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.300
So don't worry.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.560
Yes... Understood.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.520
Th-Then, I can do experiments?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.900
It's very risky.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.940
But that doesn't mean that we 
can't use him to investigate.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.820
I can be in charge of planning this, right?

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.020
Eren, if there's something 
you don't understand,

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.240
learn to understand it.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.280
It's well worth any risk to our lives.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.620
Ready, Eren?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.340
When it's prepared, I'll use the 
smoke round to notify you.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.010
After that, any decisions are up to you.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.100
Roger!

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.790
This dried-up well could hold 
even a mindless Titan...

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.890
Probably!

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.660
That's the signal.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.800
Since I sealed the wall, I haven't 
tried to control the Titan.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:22.020
If I lose control, Squad Levi 
might kill me this time...

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.540
Did he not see the signal?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.880
No...

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.150
His ability just isn't that reliable.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.890
Hey, Eren! We're calling it quits for now.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.650
Did something happen?

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.320
Hanji...

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.540
I can't become a Titan.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.080
So your self-inflicted bite wounds on 
your hands aren't healing, either?

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.300
No.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.740
If you can't transform into a Titan,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.320
our main goal of sealing Wall Maria is off the table.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.390
This is an order...

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.010
Make it happen.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.650
Yes, sir.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.640
Don't let it get you down, Eren.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.670
But...

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.570
Well, it just means you're 
more human than I thought.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.810
Better than rushing into 
something and getting killed.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.700
This isn't meaningless.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.220
Yeah...

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.750
We can't be too careful.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.560
Why is everyone so calm?

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.540
Are they okay with my being 
unable to turn into a Titan?

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:07.580
Are you okay?

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.670
Yes...

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.970
Hey...

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.810
What's that?

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.120
What was that explosion?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.490
Why now?!

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.380
Calm down.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.180
Captain Levi!

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.810
This is...

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.430
I said to calm down.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.950
All of you.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.950
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.950
Smoke Rounds (1) 
Signal rounds fired by small handguns using gunpowder. 
A small tube, with the round, is swapped out each time.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.960
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.960
Smoke Rounds (2) 
The signal color changes per message: 
Red — Titan sighted. 
Green — Change course. 
 Black — Aberrant sighted.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.340
What? What was that sound?

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.690
Eren...

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:35.480
What's the meaning of this?!

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:36.980
Sir?

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.310
Why now? Without permission?

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.030
Answer me!

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.030
Eldo, wait.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.270
Answer him, Eren!

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.240
What are you thinking?

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.780
No, that can wait...

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:51.790
Prove you're not our enemy, humanity's enemy!

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.600
Prove it! Now!

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.330
That is your responsibility!

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.860
I dare you to make a single move with that arm!

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.630
I'll cut off your head!

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.100
I can do it... I'm serious!

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.130
Want to try me?

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.070
Oluo,

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.260
I said to calm down.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.750
Captain, get away from Eren!

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.350
You're too close!

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.280
No, you're the ones who should get back.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:12.810
Get back.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.600
Why?!

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.640
My intuition.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.690
What's wrong, Eren?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.920
Say something!

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.390
Like I said...

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.520
No sudden movements!

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.190
Prove it to me, Eren!

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.120
I said I don't understand.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.830
Answer us! You think we can't kill you?

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.000
I'm serious!

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.830
Do it now!

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.900
Are you even listening?

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.870
Okay, let's do this!

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.800
Are you humanity's—

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.240
Please shut up for a second!

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.710
Eren!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.090
Can I touch that arm?!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.180
It's okay, right? Right?

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.640
Just let me touch it!

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.890
Hanji...

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.130
Wait a second!

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.770
It's... hot!

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.660
Without the skin, it's really damned hot!

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.570
Unbelievably hot!

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:00.400
Squad Leader,

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.690
you're too reckless!

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.400
Hey, don't you feel it's hot, Eren?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.480
How does it feel where the right hand connects?

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.350
I really want to see!

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.410
That's right...

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.220
If I just pull out this hand...

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.210
Stupid thing!

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.740
Hey, Eren...

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.920
Don't do anything rash!

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.000
What?!

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.180
Wait, Eren... That was too fast!

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.640
I still wanted to investigate some things...

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.900
Captain...

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.150
How do you feel?

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.620
Not... Not so good...

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.560
Until I saw that they were actually ready 
to kill me, I didn't understand...

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.490
That they doubted me so much.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.440
Of course they do.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.100
That's why I chose them.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.850
People say you only truly become a 
full member of the Survey Corps

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.110
after making it back alive from a mission.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.920
But whenever you fight the Titans, 
you never have enough information.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.550
There are too many situations you just 
can't anticipate, no matter what.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.000
They've had to cultivate the 
ability to take quick action

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.820
and to make ruthless decisions by assuming 
the worse case scenario.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.250
But that doesn't mean they've become heartless.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.380
It's not like they felt nothing when 
they turned their swords on you.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.820
Captain Levi...

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.800
Squad Leader Hanji wants to see you.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.210
Take a long crap?

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.270
Actually, it was pleasantly quick.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.330
I wasn't sure what to tell the brass.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.550
Well, for now...

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.600
Look at this.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.280
A teaspoon?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.240
Yes.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.520
The right Titan hand Eren 
created was holding this.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.500
Like this, between its index finger and thumb.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.210
It's hard to imagine that was an accident...

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.070
And for some reason,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.140
the heat and pressure didn't 
warp the spoon at all.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:37.010
Anything come to mind?

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.560
I was trying to pick it up...

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.270
I transformed right after.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.850
I see...

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.610
That may explain why you couldn't transform earlier.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.870
"Kill the Titans."

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.410
"Block the cannon shell."

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.490
"Lift the boulder."

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:02.730
In each case, you had a clear 
goal before you transformed.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.070
My theory is

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:08.220
that your self-inflicted injury 
probably isn't the sole trigger.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.800
You may need some goal, as well.

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.100
It's true that when I turned into a Titan this time,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.890
it was like when I blocked that cannon shell.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.350
But...

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.940
I turned into a Titan to pick up a spoon?

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.240
What the hell is this?

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.740
In other words, you didn't deliberately 
change without permission?

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.260
No, sir.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.250
Huh? Eh?

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.710
Wait, what are you doing?

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.790
That hurt...

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.440
This isn't easy.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.290
I'm amazed you can bite through, Eren.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.980
We made the wrong decision.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.510
This is a small price to pay.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.230
Not that it makes a difference.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.140
Keeping you under control is our job.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.800
And there's nothing wrong with that.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.030
So don't get cocky!

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.990
I'm sorry, Eren...

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.540
We've been so jumpy.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.920
You must be disappointed in our stupidity.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:29.310
However, even so...

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.860
We're going to rely on you. 
And we want you to rely on us.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.240
So...

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.220
Have faith in us...

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.070
Eren!

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.740
You're taking too long! Decide!

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.030
I'll go forward!

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.420
Let me go!

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.840
I'm sorry!

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.970
Target is accelerating!

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:28.750
Go!

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.110
We will outrun it.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.210
It's impossible to outrun it...

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.800
If we keep running away, it'll stomp us all flat!

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.030
But...

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.290
We might all die,

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.540
but everyone chose to go on,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.040
even if it meant abandoning our comrades.

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.350
Captain Levi has been looking 
forward this whole time.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.600
And the rest of the squad

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.550
believe in him, and put all their trust in him.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.060
I'll believe in them, too...

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.060
Like they

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.280
believed in me!

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.140
Fire!

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.070
Advance a bit farther, tether the horses,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.480
and switch to Maneuver Gear.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.020
You guys will be off on your own for a while.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.130
Eldo, lead the squad.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.880
Once you're a good distance away 
from the Titan, hide Eren.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.200
Take my horse.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.370
He can't intend

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.650
to take that Titan alive?

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.540
Well, Eren? See that?

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.680
We caught that Titan!

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.140
This is the power of the Survey Corps!

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.760
Don't underestimate us, fool.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.780
Well? Do you get it now?

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:34.620
Yes!

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:41.070
Looks like it's stopped moving...

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.110
We can't lower our guard.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.340
But you did well, leading it here.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.660
Men in the rearguard squads died 
buying us the time we needed.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.460
We couldn't have done it without them.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.250
Is that so?

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.760
It is.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.430
Thanks to them, we'll be able 
to see who's inside this thing.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.990
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:59.960
Erwin Smith's secret plan was 
to capture the Female Titan.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.380
The aces of the Survey Corps try 
to reveal its true identity, but...

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.830
Erwin Smith 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (4)
