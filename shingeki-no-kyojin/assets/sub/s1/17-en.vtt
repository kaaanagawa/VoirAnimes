WEBVTT

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.900
Go, Eren!

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.760
In the year 850...

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.680
For the first time,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.840
humanity recovered part of its 
territory from the Titans.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.530
Though at great cost.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
Then I welcome everyone 
here to the Survey Corps!

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.640
This is a true salute!

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.390
Offer up your hearts!

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.320
Yes, sir!

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.660
You have done well to endure your fear.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.570
You are brave soldiers.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.980
You have my heartfelt respect.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.990
A month later,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.040
led by Erwin Smith, the Survey Corps left Karanes

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.490
to find a route to Zhiganshina,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.540
where it's believed the secrets 
of the Titans are held.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.300
We will now begin the 57th 
expedition beyond the walls!

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.140
Onward!

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.980
Female Titan 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.380
Ahead, to the left, a 10-meter class!

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
I am very interested in seeing 
what's inside its stomach...

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.760
But I'll leave it to the support team!

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.890
Damn!

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.390
Not deep enough.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.900
Defend the formation!

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.440
Stay strong!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.830
Leave it to the support team, and keep going!

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.950
Onward! Onward!

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.960
The support teams will only 
accompany us to the old city area.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.400
Once we're past that, 
it's completely Titan territory.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.220
The long-range scouting formation devised 
by Commander Erwin is our only hope.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.610
We, the special ops squad, are here.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.260
Sir, can they...

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.150
Can my classmates beat the Titans?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.520
Huh?

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.670
What have you been doing the past month?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.940
Listen, brat...

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.700
The most crucial part

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.320
of an expedition is in how 
you avoid fighting Titans—

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.170
Go into long-range scouting formation!

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.680
See ya, Armin.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.050
If you run into a Titan, don't piss your pants!

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.640
Right!

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.780
Same to you, Jean.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.800
Row 3-3: Relay

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.340
The vanguard is to spread out in a semi-circle.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.980
But stay within visual range of one another.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.310
Row 5-Center: Standby

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.780
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.310
Row 2-5: Relay

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.590
Extend the recon and message relay 
range as far as possible.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.060
Row 3-4: Relay

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.860
Row 2-4: Relay

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.280
We'll be fine...

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.610
Calm down!

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.660
It's primarily the forward recon squad 
that will encounter Titans.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.540
Row 1-8: Recon

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.700
As soon as one is sighted, 
they'll fire a red smoke round.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.110
Anyone who sees the flare should fire 
the same round to relay the signal.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.390
Row 2-Center: Command

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.180
When the Commander sees it,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.140
he'll fire a green smoke round,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.770
and show the formation where to go.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.520
Thus, the entire formation can advance

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.860
toward the goal, while avoiding Titans.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.170
Row 2-3: Relay

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.990
But sometimes, due to terrain or obstacles,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.120
a Titan won't be sighted until 
it's within the formation.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.460
Red... Red...

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.920
Red smoke round...

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.800
Blause! Over here!

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.670
Damn it! Did we let one through?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.060
We'll draw it this way.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.440
Blause, get over here!

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.240
I'll handle it!

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.190
Split off!

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.160
Yes, sir!

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.720
Sir...

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.010
Back into position!

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.770
He ran out of gas.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.610
Something's wrong...

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.370
It's been a while since we saw the red smoke round,

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.980
but they still haven't reformed.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.490
It can't be...

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.910
Note that this strategy only works on normal Titans,

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.240
whose behavior can be easily predicted.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.660
A black smoke round?

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.010
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.210
and heading for the formation's center?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.000
It has to be...

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.590
That's

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.190
an Aberrant!

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.850
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.510
whose behavior is unpredictable.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.100
Damn, we'll have to fight it...

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.940
Sys, go for the neck!

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.900
I'll stop it!

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.230
Roger!

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.320
Using Maneuver Gear on flat 
terrain is a huge disadvantage.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.320
It almost never works.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.480
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.980
I think that's Arlert over there.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.810
I don't want one of the 
new guys to run into it.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.370
We kill it here!

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.130
Now, Sys!

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.270
You did it, Squad Leader Ness!

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.190
Did I get him?

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.430
You came for me?

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.370
That's my partner...

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.670
I love you, Shallot!

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:24.990
Again?

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.960
What is the right flank recon squad doing?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.870
If it ignored them and came this way,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.620
it must be another Aberrant.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.940
Oh, fine...

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.010
Sys, we do it again.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:37.800
Right.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.310
But we've got the worst luck, 
doing this twice in a row...

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.370
And I think it's at least a fourteen-meter class.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.390
This one will be tough.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.210
What's that?

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.370
It's too fast!

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.330
Don't let it reach Arlert!

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.030
Sys!

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.570
Right!

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.280
No... No.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.920
That's no Aberrant.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.620
It's intelligent!

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.850
Like the Armored or Colossal Titans, or Eren...

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.830
A human in the body of a Titan!

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.330
B-But who?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.840
Why?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.800
This is bad! What should I do?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.970
I'm going to die, too...

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:56.880
I'll be killed!

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.380
Go! Run!

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.310
What does it...

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.810
No, what do they...

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.980
What do they want?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:26.080
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:26.080
Long-Range Scouting Formation (1) 
Devised by Survey Corps Commander 
Erwin Smith, its use has dramatically 
increased survival rates outside the walls.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.080
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.080
Long Range Scouting Formation (2) 
Put simply, it's a form of human "radar." By quickly 
alerting Erwin in the center to the discovery of 
any Titans, the Survey Corps can change course.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.250
Someone tell them...

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:40.170
That the right flank recon squad 
has been wiped out...

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.450
A Female Titan brought 
a huge Titan army!

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.560
Is anyone there?

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.160
It's not going to kill me?

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.840
Why?

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.040
It removed my hood...

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.740
To... To look at my face?

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.310
Armin!

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.570
Reiner!

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.300
Hey, can you stand?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.390
You won't last outside the walls 
unless you're on horseback...

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.390
Hurry!

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.430
Right!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.320
I saw the smoke round signaling an Aberrant.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.770
Was it that one there with the nice ass?

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.350
That's no Aberrant...

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:24.400
It's a human in a Titan body!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.900
What was that?

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.170
Wait a second.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.700
We need to fire a smoke round first.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.300
H-Hurry...

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.350
There's an emergency over there.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:34.870
With a smoke round, I'll...

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.130
Wait... I think Jean fired it.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.240
It came from the right flank.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.090
Does that mean we're so compromised, 
we can't continue the mission?

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.390
Looks like the right flank recon 
squad was partially wiped out...

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.480
Titans, tons of them.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.720
I don't know why,

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.850
but there are lots of fast ones.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:58.660
For now, we're holding them back,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.560
but recon is no longer possible...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.670
We've taken heavy losses,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.300
and if we aren't careful, we'll be destroyed!

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.110
That Titan came from the same direction.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.530
No way...

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.210
Was it leading the Titans?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.830
It?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.830
Why is a Titan over there?

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.300
An Aberrant?

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:23.300
No, it's a human in a Titan body...

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.420
Someone with the same ability as Eren.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.170
What?

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.860
Why do you think that, Armin?

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.640
The Titans only eat us.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.320
We're just killed in the process.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.600
Killing us isn't ever specifically their goal.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.860
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.320
it crushed him and smashed him into the ground.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.140
It killed him to kill, rather than to eat him.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.870
Its nature is different from the others.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.430
When the Colossal and Armored 
Titans destroyed the walls,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.130
it must've been the one that 
brought that army of Titans.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.930
Their goal has consistently been to attack all humanity!

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.380
No, maybe not.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.520
It felt like it was looking for someone...

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.770
If that is the case, 
could it be looking for...

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.560
Could it be looking for Eren?

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.600
Eren?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.100
Eren's with Squad Levi, which is 
in charge of the right flank.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.030
The right flank?

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.670
The plans I got had them 
to the rear of the left flank.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.600
Mine said they were near 
the front of the right...

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.040
Wait, there's no way they'd 
be on the front lines.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.920
So where are they?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.600
Probably the safest place in the formation.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.590
Which means in the center, 
and toward the rear...

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.050
Armin!

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.810
There's no time to think.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.310
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate 
how much of a threat it poses!

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.330
At this rate, it'll wipe out command.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.540
Then the formation will fall apart, 
and that'll be the end.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.900
What are you trying to say?

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.760
In other words,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.630
at this range, we may still be 
able to draw its attention.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.350
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.080
Maybe... Maybe...

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.790
But it really is intelligent.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.750
To it, we are nothing but insignificant insects.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.840
It'll just crush us...

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.360
Seriously?

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.340
That's scary...

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.630
Hey, are you really Jean?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.850
The Jean I know never thinks 
of anyone but himself.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.390
Don't be an ass...

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.150
I just don't want those charred bones I saw

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.640
to be disappointed in me!

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.440
I...

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.840
I know what I have to do now!

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.100
And this is the job we chose.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.290
Help me!

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.490
Put on your hood.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.610
As far forward as you can...

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.630
So that your face is hidden from it.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.580
I don't think it will kill us until 
it knows who we are!

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.760
Oh...

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.570
You believe if it thinks we might 
be Eren, it won't kill us?

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.150
If nothing else, it'll make me feel better.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.270
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:36.510
Armin, I thought it was creepy 
how you always clung to Eren.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.620
But I've always thought you had it in you.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.370
Uh, thanks.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.620
But "creepy"? That's really mean...

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.970
It's going much more slowly 
than when I first saw it.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:03.530
Is it tired?

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.950
If it runs at that speed again, we'll be too late!

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.190
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.320
Listen up... Remember what I said.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.200
Try to draw its attention 
for as long as possible,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.570
to give the formation time to withdraw!

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.780
Keep it here as long as you can.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.730
If we could cut its Achilles tendon, 
that'd be more than enough.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.650
But don't do anything stupid...

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.050
Don't try to kill it!

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.280
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.050
It's totally different than other Titans...

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.640
It is impossible to kill.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.270
At least, not by any normal human being.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:51.630
However...

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.890
If it's those two... Maybe...

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.530
Armin!

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.010
This one...

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.310
Its movements are much more 
precise than the others' are!

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.400
Damn it.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.490
I...

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.660
I underestimated it!

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.630
It protected its neck...

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.590
Jean!

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.460
Damn it! I can't get away!

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.720
I'm going to die!

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.090
Once it grasps my wire, it's over!

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.820
Jean!

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.810
Avenge the suicidal bastard!

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.310
Armin?

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.010
It stopped?

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.590
That's the one...

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.340
That's the one that killed him!

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.140
He rushed to his death on the right flank!

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.530
Avenge him!

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.250
What happened?

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.600
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.320
This isn't the time...

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.250
R-Reiner?

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.970
It crushed my best friend!

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.930
I saw his body under its foot!

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.810
He's going straight for the neck?

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.480
No, it's working!

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.150
While it's distracted by Armin!

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.860
H-Hey...

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.480
H-Hey... Reiner, you...

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.650
Reiner did it!

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.310
Mikasa was so strong, I forgot.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.490
But he's really strong and reliable, too...

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.420
We've bought enough time, right?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.080
Let's get the hell away from it!

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.330
If it isn't a man-eater, it won't follow us!

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.790
Look...

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.090
That big bitch got scared 
and decided to go home!

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.930
No... Why?

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.670
That's toward the center rear.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.250
Is it

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.390
heading toward Eren?

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.160
"You monster..."

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.660
Even highly trained members of the Survey Corps

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.370
are unable to stop the Female Titan.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:08.220
The monster finally catches sight 
of Eren in a forest of giant trees.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.310
Forest of Giant Trees 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls(2)
