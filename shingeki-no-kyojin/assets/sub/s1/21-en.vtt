WEBVTT

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.380
We will now begin the 57th 
expedition beyond the walls!

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.320
Onward!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.870
The Survey Corps left to 
find a route to Zhiganshina,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.050
but encountered a Female Titan,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.240
a transformed human like Eren.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.370
That's no Aberrant.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.090
It's a human in the body of a Titan!

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.130
As soldiers died, one after the next,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.900
they headed into a 
forest of giant trees,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.360
none of them knowing why.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.530
If Squad Levi doesn't 
defeat it, who will?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.160
Choose.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.410
Believe in yourself.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.490
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.540
I'll go forward!

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.750
Fire!

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.880
Oh, right...

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.320
I wanted to ask you something.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.850
Is it okay if we cut off 
your hands and legs?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.450
They'll grow back, right?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.650
I'm talking about <i>your </i>
limbs, not the Titan's.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.950
We need you alive, after all...

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.090
The enemy was willing 
to sacrifice everything.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.090
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy 
itself along with the evidence

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.030
by making Titans devour itself.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.200
Retreat, men!

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660
Back into formation!

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.730
Return to Karanes!

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.480
Erwin...

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.480
Why did you order Levi to resupply?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.570
There's no time to waste.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.770
The Female Titan was eaten.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.470
But did you see the 
person inside get eaten?

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.610
I didn't.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.640
You can't mean...

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.410
Yes...

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250
If your original hypothesis was correct,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.270
and they can still move to a degree 
after regaining human form...

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.510
And if they'd equipped 
Maneuver Gear in advance...

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.310
The one within the Female Titan 
is wearing our uniform right now.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.020
Captain Levi?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.550
No, it's not!

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.230
Who are you?!

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.440
Gunther!

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.200
The enemy is now camouflaged 
as one of our men.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.010
Crushing Blow 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.180
When the Colossal Titan vanished,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.690
whoever was inside had been 
wearing Maneuver Gear,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.270
so that they could escape in the steam.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.650
Don't you think the same 
possibility applies here?

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.400
But at the time...

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.610
Based on what we saw when Eren 
emerged from the Titan,

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.200
we concluded it would be impossible.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.290
His equipment was destroyed, 
and his uniform was gone.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.250
Above all, Eren was so weak, 
he couldn't even stand unassisted.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.540
The Female Titan was able to 
attract other Titans with its cry.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.600
We failed to predict this, 
and the operation failed.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.100
If Titan abilities vary 
depending on skill,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.010
it was a mistake to use Eren, a total novice, 
as the basis for our assumptions.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.760
If we are to outwit our enemy, 
we'll need to think outside the box.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.160
If we're withdrawing, does that 
mean the mission succeeded?

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.270
If so, then we may already know who 
was inside the Female Titan.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.000
I'd like to see who it is...

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.860
But why was the Commander so sure

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.380
that the enemy would come after 
Eren if he left the walls?

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.430
I think it's because, for some reason,

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.040
they suddenly stopped their advance 
in the midst of the last assault.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.100
Even though they managed 
to break through Trost's gate,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.770
they didn't even try for the inner gate.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.940
And when Eren sealed 
the gate, they let him.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.590
It could mean that they now 
have bigger concerns...

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.580
Bigger concerns?

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.620
Something more important to 
them than breaching the walls.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.370
Something unexpected that happened.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.460
Eren's transformation into a Titan?!

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.170
I think it's the only answer.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.930
Then... That means...

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.090
Wait... So...

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.260
Someone who was there, 
who saw Eren transform,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.640
is the Titan.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.730
Gunther!

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.850
Eren, don't stop!

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.110
Onward!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.110
But Gunther...

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.400
Who's there?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.450
Protect Eren!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.280
Damn it, what do we do?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.240
Eldo, where should we go?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.200
There isn't time to reach the horses!

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.160
Head for HQ, as fast as you can!

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.510
Is it from the Female Titan? 
Or is there more than one?

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.300
Damn you...

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.380
How dare you?!

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.220
Come at me!

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.760
I'll defeat you, even if it kills me!

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.470
The Female Titan?

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.350
Impossible... Why?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.770
Didn't we catch it?!

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.360
If the enemy has some way 
to retain its strength,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.080
it may be able to transform once more.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.790
I knew it...

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:03.790
It's coming!

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.920
The Female Titan!

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.220
Damn you...

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.220
How dare you!

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.640
This time, I will defeat it!

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.430
No!

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.560
The three of us will 
kill the Female Titan.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.690
You will continue to head 
straight for HQ at top speed!

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.490
Here's what I have gleaned 
from this battle...

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.800
If we only focus on 
making the best moves,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.450
we will never get the 
better of our opponent.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.740
When necessary, we must be 
willing to take big risks,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.620
and be prepared to lose everything.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.380
I'll fight, too!

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.130
No!

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.210
This is the best move...

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.380
Your power is too risky!

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.920
What? Do you doubt us?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.740
Do you, Eren?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.470
Do you find it that hard to trust us?

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.770
Unless we change how we fight,

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.920
humanity cannot win!

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.040
I believe my squad will be victorious.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.780
Good luck!

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.310
We took its sight.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.980
For at least a minute, 
it'll be in total darkness!

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.230
Kill it during this time!

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.570
Screw capturing it...

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.360
Kill it now!

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.650
Die here without honor!

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.400
Make that bitch of a Titan pay!

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.330
We won't let your eyes regenerate!

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.970
We'll shear off so much muscle 
around your shoulders,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.550
you won't be able to keep your arms up!

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.980
Shear it off...

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.400
Make its arms...

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.560
...fall!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.730
They're down!

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.400
Now the neck!

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.120
Shear off the muscles 
that support its neck!

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.780
And we can strike its weak point!

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.080
They're so strong.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.290
The Female Titan is 
totally on the defensive.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.960
How can they launch co-op attacks like that
without even speaking to each other?

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.580
I bet it's only possible because 
they believe in one another.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.620
They've overcome many 
hardships that way.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.470
That's why they're so strong, 
even right after losing Gunther.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.100
I'll go forward...

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.090
If I go forward and believe in them, 
without turning back, then...

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.800
I'm sure that's the right answer.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.870
I finally understand!

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.240
I don't know...

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.590
I never have.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.000
I can believe in my own abilities

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.170
or the choices of companions I trust.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.130
But no one ever knows 
how it will turn out.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.260
Strike the neck, now!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.360
Eldo!

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.610
H-How?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.570
It can't possibly see!

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.740
It hasn't even been thirty seconds...

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.790
Only one eye?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.740
It prioritized one eye 
to accelerate the healing...

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.080
Is that even possible?

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.830
Petra!

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.290
We need to regroup!

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.130
Petra, now!

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.850
Hey...

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.430
Die!

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.650
How?

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.650
My blade can't pierce it...

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.420
I...

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.670
I will...

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.140
I'll kill it!

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.910
Eren?

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.990
Wait, what? Mikasa?

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.320
That voice... Don't tell me...

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.010
Survey Corps Horses (1) 
The horses of the Survey Corps were bred 
specifically for them, and stand around 
160 cm, weighing between 450 and 500 kg.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
Survey Corps Horses (2) 
Their top speed is between 75 and 80 km/h, 
and they can maintain speeds of 35 km/h. 
Horses are about the only way to escape a Titan.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.000
I made the wrong choice...

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.390
I wanted to believe in my companions...

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.610
Because of that, everyone died!

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.860
If I had believed in myself 
from the start and fought...

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.700
If I'd only killed it at the beginning!

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.220
Back then,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.290
if I'd turned into a Titan...

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.430
No...

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.810
If I'd fought

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.850
even before that...

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.700
Captain Levi was there, too.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.730
We would have won.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.490
Maybe we could've captured it.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.610
You aren't wrong.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.830
If you want to, do it.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.280
I...

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.500
I made a choice.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.970
And it killed everyone.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.130
It's my fault they died.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.720
But despite all that...

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.020
It's still your fault!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.240
I'll tear you apart...

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.280
Once my hand heals,

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.540
I'll rip you apart... 
Tear you to shreds...

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.080
Rip you into tiny pieces...

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.290
And eat you!

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.120
Eren!

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:16.330
W-Wait... Eren...

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.710
Don't go...

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.670
Give...

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.500
Give...

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.460
Give Eren back!

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.320
Give him back!

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.630
Give him back!

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.960
Why won't my blade penetrate?

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.610
I know that

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.960
he's alive...

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.760
I know that Eren's alive!

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.930
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.350
rip her apart,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.690
and get you out of that filth.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.980
I'm sorry, Eren...

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:42.280
Just wait a little longer...

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:50.740
Wait!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:52.660
Wh-What are you...

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.470
Fall back for now.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.110
Maintain this distance.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.320
It may be tired.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.580
It does not appear to 
be going very fast.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.850
He seems to have been bit 
right out of the neck.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.850
Is Eren dead?

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.490
"Eren is alive."

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.240
"Give Eren back."

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.440
The Female Titan took Eren from 
Mikasa before her very eyes.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.720
Mikasa joins forces with humanity's 
strongest fighter, Levi,

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.810
to challenge the Female Titan to battle.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:25:00.000
