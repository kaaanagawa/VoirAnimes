00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
Smile 
Raid on Stohess District (1)

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.160
Looking good, Annie!

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.120
That's my girl!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400
What are you doing, Annie?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.620
No breaks!

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.270
Wall Sina 
Eastern Walled City

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.510
What? You hadn't heard?

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.990
That Titan kid and the main leadership

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.020
Stohess District

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.020
have been summoned to the capital.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.450
They'll be coming through town today.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.490
I see.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.530
Then I'm sure he'll end up dissected this time.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.140
Either way, I hope things work out, 
and that they seal the gate.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.650
Did you say seal the gate?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.080
You still insist on defiling 
the gods with human hands?

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.660
Maria! Rose! Sina!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.920
Defiling the three goddesses with 
human hands is unforgivable!

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.700
Those people love the walls, 
and worship them as gods.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.750
Stay away from them.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.750
Ah...

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.730
I didn't realize any of them were still around.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.630
Damn it.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.930
Only the walls will protect us!

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.440
Military Police 
Stohess HQ

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.160
You finally woke up.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.160
You look so scary when you sleep, 
I couldn't wake you.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.410
Sorry, Annie.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.420
Lately, you've been too lax.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.380
What?

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.800
Are you mad?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.360
Well, aren't you a friendly one?

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.570
Leave her alone.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.830
Annie's from Trost District.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.180
And she's the only one in this 
HQ who's been in a fight.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.960
She just came back from hell. 
It'll take her a while to recover.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.010
I get it... You like her.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.490
What's so great about her?

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.740
Hitch,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.770
there's only one way a moron like you 
makes it into the Military Police.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.960
What's that? I wouldn't know.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.320
Tell me.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.450
Stop it, you two!

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.460
Don't bother.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.820
Today, we have a different task for 
you than the normal busywork.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.460
That's why I had all of you come here.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.610
It's about the Survey Corps group 
that's being summoned to the capital.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.970
They'll be passing through the 
city's main street today.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.560
Escorting them is a Military Police HQ job,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.480
so we just need to handle them 
as they come through town.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.140
Temporary permission for in-city use of 
3D Maneuver Gear has been granted.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.990
You will guard them in tandem 
with their own security.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.870
You'll travel by barge to the area 
where your mission will begin.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.780
That is all.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.250
May I ask something?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.000
Hmm? What?

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.250
What are we protecting them from?

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.460
I've never heard of anyone within the 
walls acting against the monarchy.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.050
There are minor criminals.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.230
But it's hard to imagine any real organization 
unless they were based outside the walls.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.730
And I can't imagine any possible motive.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.010
You're so serious.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.940
Okay, you're in charge of everything.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.530
Here are the details.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.480
We ranking officers are busy.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.810
You guys, handle this on your own.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.790
But don't screw up.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.650
Sorry I held up your game.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.780
Let's get back to it.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.140
Whose turn was it?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.550
Damn! He's just screwing around!

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.720
Yeah...

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.200
This organization is even more 
rotten than I'd imagined.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.940
But of course, that's why I chose it...

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.240
But when you're a rookie, they make 
you do almost everything.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.730
I didn't know that before.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.130
Scum.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.820
Damn scum who can only 
think of themselves!

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.450
What are you talking about, Marlow?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.200
Since you chose the MPs, you're no better.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.080
I am better!

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.190
I'm not trash like you.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.770
I came here to correct the Military Police.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.370
Wow, Marlow.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.670
I had no idea you were this way.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.550
And how will you do that?

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.980
I'll have to work my way up.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.820
When I'm in charge,

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.760
I'll fix the discipline issues, 
and punish those who are corrupt.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.890
It's simple.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.420
I'll make MP a place for 
normal human beings again.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:23.900
That's all.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.870
The way humans are supposed to be.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.910
Wow, you're the real deal!

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.160
And here, I thought you were boring! Sorry!

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.880
That's quite a noble goal you've got there.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.470
Good luck.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.660
I'm not so sure.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.420
Huh?

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.130
If a "good person" like you ends up in control,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.420
I think that'd be the end for us.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.810
What's this?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.680
You actually have something to say?

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.130
I think you're right.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.310
Because you say the right things.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.440
I know someone like that.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.900
Going against the flow takes a lot of courage.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.450
I respect that.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.560
You may just be an idiot, but...

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.160
Maybe it's just that the other 
guy you know is an idiot.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.790
But I'm not like him.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.900
We've wasted too much time on idle chitchat.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.700
Let's go!

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.470
The escort wagons will pass through 
the outer gate in forty-five minutes.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.090
When we reach the staging area, 
everyone should confirm positions.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.410
Got it?

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.800
Uh-huh.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.980
Hey!

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.480
What's that?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.690
That's our equipment.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.610
Aren't they taking it deeper within the walls?

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.950
But that doesn't explain the 
Merchant Association's involvement.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.040
What's going on?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.880
They're selling our equipment 
on the black market?

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.440
Hey, what about the mission?

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.670
Oh, crap... He really is the real deal!

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.400
Well, for better or worse, we have time.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.140
Let's enjoy the show.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.110
Okay, let's go get a drink.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.460
What's going on, rookie? 
What do you want?

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.290
S-Selling government equipment is a crime...

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.290
And?

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.500
The people's taxes paid 
for that equipment, and...

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.130
So you're threatening your superiors, rookie?

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.580
I'm looking forward to your future.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.780
Go buy yourself a woman, and relax a little.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.670
W-Wait!

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.610
Selling government equipment—

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.770
H-Hey...

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.000
We'll arrest you for opposing a superior officer.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.250
Shut up...

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.420
That's illegal...

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.520
And no one will care.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.350
Not here!

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.150
Could you let him go with that?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.160
I'm sorry... It seems our idiot 
is causing problems for you.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.160
We'll teach him a harsh lesson.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.750
Or...

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.390
Would you prefer to make a bigger scene?

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.180
This is the last time.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.540
Yes, sir!

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.950
All right, let's get that drink.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.350
Yeah, it's been a hard day's work.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.880
So do it.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.280
Aren't you going to punish the corrupt?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.640
If you want, I'll help you.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.880
What do you want to eat?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.930
What else?

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.760
Meat!

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.590
Damn it!

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.600
We know you're doing your best, missy.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.230
That isn't true at all...

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.020
That idiot you know...

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.860
The one you talked about... 
Would he have done it?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.330
Maybe.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:34.790
Then I'm one of those pieces of 
trash you were talking about,

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.790
the ones who just go with the flow, right?

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.340
I don't know.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.850
But isn't that what normal 
human beings do, too?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.350
I just want

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.350
the weak who do get swept 
along with the flow

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.160
to be considered human, too.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.210
Annie...

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.480
Hey.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:38.000
You're one of the Military 
Police now, aren't you?

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.080
Armin...

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.990
The Military Police (1) 
The Military Police number around 2,000, 
but if you add the Garrison under their command, 
their actual force is approximately 5,000.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:53.000
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:53.000
The Military Police (2) 
Each walled city has about 200 MP stationed there. 
Primary duties are to oversee trainee brigades, monitor 
the Garrison, and direct fire-fighting operations.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.000
Why are you dressed like that?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.730
I'm a pack bearer.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.420
I have my Maneuver Gear 
hidden under my rain coat.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.760
Look.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.550
What's going on?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.980
Annie, would you assist me 
in helping Eren escape?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.750
Escape where?

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.620
If you disobey the monarchy, 
where will you go inside these walls?

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.720
We'll just hide for a while.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.900
I don't intend to fight the monarchy head-on.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.280
It will be reported as a rebellion by 
a portion of the Survey Corps.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.780
It'll buy time.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.910
Time we'll spend finding enough ammunition 
to counter the other factions at the tribunal.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.380
And we <i>will</i> find it.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.120
Enough ammunition?

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.920
Is something so convenient just lying around?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.420
What's your evidence?

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.930
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.480
Sorry, but I can't help you.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.000
I won't tell anyone, but you'll 
have to do it on your own.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.100
Annie!

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:00.680
Please!

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.610
Eren will be killed!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:08.590
Clueless people who only care 
about saving their own skin

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.340
will unwittingly set humanity on 
a path toward self-destruction!

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.550
I know I can't convince you.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.670
But even so...

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.300
I have to make a big wager!

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.280
Of course, I'll do my best to 
avoid causing you trouble.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.540
But to get through the 
checkpoints within Wall Sina,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.140
I need Military Police help!

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.700
This is the only way!

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.860
Armin...

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.150
Do I really look like such 
a good person to you?

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.470
A good person?

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.600
Well...

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.880
I don't really like that term.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.320
Because to me,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.230
it just seems to mean someone 
who's good <i>for</i> you.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.420
And I don't think there's any one 
person who's good for everyone.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.380
So if you don't help me...

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:10.430
Then, to me, you're a bad person, right?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.940
Fine.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.900
I'm in.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.410
That was easier than I thought it'd be.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.130
Shh!

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.500
That's the Military Police for you.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.640
You can see how hard they work every day.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.140
Stop staring.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:01.930
Let's just hope they won't find out 
that Jean's taken my place.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.030
That won't last long, though...

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.980
We don't look alike at all.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.820
It's fine.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.740
Both of you look like criminals, 
with the same nasty look in your eyes.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.150
I don't have a horse face like him.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.620
Hey, if I hadn't helped you, how did 
you plan to get over the wall?

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.880
I was going to use the Maneuver 
Gear to get through.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.720
That's insane.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.630
Wouldn't it have been easier to escape 
before you'd reached Stohess?

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.280
Why here? And why now?

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.940
I felt that the complicated 
layout of this city

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.250
would give us a better chance 
at swapping Eren with Jean.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.040
And I thought pretending to go along with it,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.010
rather than an outright opposition, 
would prevent suspicion

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.110
and buy our escape more time.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.530
I see.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:54.560
I get it now.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:00.310
There!

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.570
Here?

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.790
Yeah, we go through here.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.180
The remains of an underground city

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.420
they planned and abandoned 
are still down here.

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:20.810
This takes us

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.740
close to the outer gate.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.670
Really? Wow!

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:28.520
Annie?

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.500
What's wrong?

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.190
Don't tell me you're afraid 
of dark, cramped places.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.730
Yes, I am.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.740
I'm sure that a brave, 
suicidal bastard like you

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:45.500
wouldn't understand how 
a weak girl like me feels.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:53.640
A girl who can spin a man around 
in mid-air isn't weak.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.010
Stop being an idiot. Hurry up!

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.510
No, I won't go that way.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.300
It scares me.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.550
If we aren't going above ground, I won't help.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.660
What are you saying?!

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.030
Get down here!

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.420
Stop screwing around!

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.790
Eren, don't shout.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.650
It's not a problem, is it, Mikasa?

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:26.240
For some reason,

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.550
there hasn't been anyone nearby for a while.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.620
Jeez!

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.430
I'm hurt.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.560
When did you start looking at me that way...

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.420
Armin?

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.030
Annie, why?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.110
Why did you have Marco's Maneuver Gear?

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.670
I remember even its tiniest marks and dings...

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.960
because we'd repaired them together.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:11.800
That's why I recognized them.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.460
I see...

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.460
Well... I happened to find it.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:25.220
Then you killed the two Titans we captured?

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.540
Who knows...

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.400
But if you thought that a month 
ago, why didn't you act then?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.520
Because I still can't believe it!

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.580
I wanted to think that my 
eyes had deceived me.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.280
And because of that...

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.240
But... What about you?

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.250
You didn't kill me back then.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.960
And that's why this is happening now.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.940
Yeah, I think so, too.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.040
I never expected you to push me this far.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:18.280
Why didn't I kill you then?

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.240
Hey, Annie...

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.320
There's still a chance you're an idiot

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.410
who's just going along with this because 
you have a shitty sense of humor.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.550
So get down here now!

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:34.140
You can prove something 
just by going underground!

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.790
Get down here, and prove it!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.550
I can't...

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.550
I have failed to become a warrior.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.550
I said this isn't funny!

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:45.960
Let's talk, Annie!

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.930
We can still talk—

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:49.190
That's enough.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.730
I can't listen to any more of this.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.400
It's pointless.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.910
I'll tear you apart again, Female Titan!

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.310
Armin, I'm glad I could be 
a good person to you.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.570
You've won your bet.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.480
But...

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.360
This is where <i>my</i> bet begins!

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.860
Eren!

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.800
Mikasa!

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.630
We were too late!

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.520
Annie Leonhart was the Female Titan.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.460
However, Eren is unable to transform 
before the Female Titan.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.180
It is because the Female Titan is Annie.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.950
Mercy 
Raid on Stohess District (2)
