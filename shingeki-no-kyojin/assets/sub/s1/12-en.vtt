WEBVTT

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.850
In the year 845...

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.690
the Colossal and Armored 
Titans suddenly appeared,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.210
destroying the wall, 
along with the life we'd known.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.580
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.500
losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.980
to retreat within Wall Rose.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.260
And in the year 850...

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.640
The Colossal Titan reappeared 
and breached the wall.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.470
And once again, humanity could 
not stop a Titan invasion.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.200
Soldiers fell, one after the 
next, before the Titan assault.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.230
And then...

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.650
Eren! Hurry!

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.950
Eren Jaeger had been 
devoured by a Titan,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.050
but reappeared, emerging 
from a mysterious Titan.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.960
Attention!

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.090
Dot Pixis, the high commander 
of the southern territories,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.690
recognized the combat potential 
of Eren's ability to become a Titan,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.040
and decided to execute 
an audacious plan.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.270
He will become a Titan, 
pick up the giant boulder

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.270
by the shattered gate, carry it over,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.430
and seal the hole.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.050
When this mission succeeds,

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.800
humanity will have retaken

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160
its territory from them 
for the very first time.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.120
But for humanity, that step will be

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.830
a great advance in our 
attack on the Titans!

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.000
However, as soon as it has begun, the mission 
already seems to be on the brink of failure...

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.980
Wound 
The Battle for Trost (8)

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.320
We've somehow managed

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.030
to lure most of the Titans 
to the town's edge...

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.030
But despite our best 
efforts to avoid combat,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.530
we've lost around twenty 
percent of our troops.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.670
We didn't lose them.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.790
Those soldiers didn't die on their own.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.960
They died due to my orders.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.360
This battle will decide 
humanity's survival.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.790
And to win, I am willing 
to be called a murderer.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.240
Ackerman!

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.230
Hey! Ackerman, stop!

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.760
Get away from him!

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.290
Eren, don't you know who I am?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.510
It's me, Mikasa!

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.280
Your family!

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.730
You must use that boulder 
to seal the hole!

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.230
The mission has failed.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.250
I knew there wasn't any secret weapon.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.390
Eren, you're human!

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.070
You're...

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.410
Move, Ackerman!

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.630
What the?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.300
He's just like any other stupid Titan!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.960
Eren!

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.260
Captain Ian!

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.600
Two Titans approaching from the front!

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.690
A 10-meter and a 6-meter class.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.560
Another from the rear, as well!

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.980
One 12-meter class coming this way!

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.070
Ian, we must retreat!

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.650
Look at him!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.490
No way is that hole getting sealed!

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:49.570
Yeah...

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.450
We have no choice but to leave him here.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.170
Red smoke round from the 
elite force sighted.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.970
A serious problem has happened 
during the mission.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.840
We're dying for no reason.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.040
My friends died for nothing!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.680
Hey! Look at that!

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.280
What? What is that?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.710
It... failed?

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.320
Why?

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.320
Hey, Armin! 
Where are you going?

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.320
Commander Pixis,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.520
we should recall them 
to defend the gate.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:36.950
Shall I do it?

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:37.870
No.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.840
Shouldn't we order the 
elite force to retreat?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.790
No.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.460
Continue drawing the Titans 
to the edge of town.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.340
The elite force has full 
tactical discretion.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.110
They are not simply excellent soldiers.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.840
They're the best of the best, 
entrusted with humanity's fate.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.400
For them to give up so easily 
would be unimaginable.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.090
They'll fight to the end...

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.360
So the deaths of the fallen will 
not have been in vain.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.340
Hey, what's wrong?

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.620
Give the order!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.540
Ian, it wasn't your fault!

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.870
The plan was always a long shot.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.810
Everyone knew that.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.290
It was worth trying, and we 
took our best shot!

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.670
Come on! Our squads will climb the walls.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.620
Wait!

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.480
Wait...

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.750
Calm down, Ackerman.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.090
Riko, your squad will handle the 
12-meter Titan behind us.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.130
Mitabi's squad and mine will 
take the two in front.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.300
What?

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.520
I'm the one they left in charge!

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.240
Shut up and follow your orders!

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.980
We can't leave Jaeger defenseless.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.720
I'm changing the plan.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.050
We protect Jaeger from the Titans 
until we can retrieve him.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.950
He's still valuable as one 
of humanity's last hopes.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.670
We cannot just abandon him like this.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.960
We can be replaced, but he can't be.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.080
The failure of that 
dysfunctional human weapon

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.980
has already cost several hundred lives!

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.810
You're saying we should bring him 
back, so this can happen again?

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.170
That's right.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.010
We must try as many times as necessary, 
regardless of the cost in lives!

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.040
What happened to Eren?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.320
Armin's headed there by himself.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.840
He's probably all right.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.260
Probably?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.360
He's fine.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.120
I'm sure of it.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.030
Eren can do this.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.020
I think luring the Titans to the 
town's edge is useless.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.690
Any fight with Titans 
is a war of attrition.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.630
At this stage, they want to avoid 
the needless loss of troops.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.460
Then anyone who doesn't make it now 
will have died for nothing?

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.690
Eventually, it will become an all-out war.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.360
But until then, we must 
preserve our forces.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.660
It's obvious that we should 
minimize casualties.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.560
The brass made the right call.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.140
Is that so, huh?

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.400
It is!

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.190
Anyway...

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.040
Let's both ensure that we 
don't end up as casualties.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.730
Ian, are you serious?

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.620
How else should humanity 
defeat the Titans?

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.290
Riko, tell me!

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.380
Is there any other way to get 
ourselves out of this mess?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.710
Some way to maintain our human dignity,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.790
without more deaths?!

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.000
How can we counter the Titans' 
overwhelming advantage over us?

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.330
As if I'd know of a way to defeat them!

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.290
That's right...

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.310
So for the moment, this is 
all we can and should do.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.810
We must be willing to sacrifice our lives

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.110
and do our best for that 
incomprehensible human weapon.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.650
Pathetic, isn't it?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.520
But as humans, it's all we can do.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.810
Now, what will you do?

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.870
This is the only battle we can fight.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.700
This is the struggle we've 
been allowed to engage.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.680
I can't accept that.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.070
Riko!

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.430
I'll obey the order.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.890
I think what you're saying is right.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.640
But as we struggle our hardest, 
we'll also show them

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.040
how terrifying humans can be.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.900
I refuse to die for nothing.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.040
Leave the 12-meter class 
behind us to my squad.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:42.620
Let's go.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.580
Our target will be the two in the front.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.410
Yeah.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.040
Thank you, Captain Ian.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.650
Ackerman, there's no need to thank me.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.970
I was terrified because there's 
no telling what you'll do.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.170
Do as you like, just as 
in the original plan.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.540
That will be a more efficient 
use of your abilities.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.970
Yes, sir.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.680
You have to protect your boyfriend.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.520
We're family.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.070
What?

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.070
The damaged parts aren't regenerating?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.160
Is it due to the earlier damage he took?

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.650
What will that do to Eren?

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.910
And is there any guarantee 
he can regain human form?

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.600
No, stop this.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.640
I will not be able to find 
answers to these questions.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.260
For now, I'll just do what I can.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:48.850
Eren...

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.570
Mikasa! What happened?

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.950
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.950
3D Maneuver Gear Weight-Shifting Device (3) 
Users must shift their entire weight to 
one side of their hips or the other. 
This permits acrobatic movement, 
but heavily taxes the muscles.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.960
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.960
3D Maneuver Gear Training (3) 
For this reason, instructors will deliberately 
cut student lifelines to gauge reactions. 
While unsafe, anyone who dies during 
training would be unable to fight Titans anyway.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.870
What?

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.820
What... am I doing now?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.390
Am I sitting?

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.780
I can't see a thing.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.140
What day is it?

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.900
Where am I?

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.410
Hmm?

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.760
I'm at home?

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.100
I'll go back to sleep.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.760
Eren!

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.850
What are you doing, Eren?

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.610
Listen up.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.330
You just need to keep the Titans 
in the corner of the city.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.510
Stay focused on that, 
and draw them there.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.310
Got it?

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.490
You don't need to fight.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.820
Trainees, form groups of three 
and run along the ground.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.150
When you reach the wall, jump up.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.480
Don't get killed.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.680
If any Titans break away, 
we'll take care of them.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.130
"If"?

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.700
Isn't it more of a "when" than an "if"?

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:41.330
If we think we're in danger, 
can we deviate from our orders?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.630
If you believe it'll help.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.740
Kirschstein squad, go!

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.590
Right!

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.420
This is bad! Behind us!

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.120
One 13-meter class!

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.950
It's approaching Jaeger!

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.210
More Titans coming through the hole!

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.110
Four Titans, approximately 
10-meter class!

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.410
Ackerman, take the one behind us!

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.310
Got it.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.320
Don't let it near Jaeger!

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.190
We'll stop them here!

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:27.970
Right!

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.710
Even if they are elite, two squads 
can't handle four at once...

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.550
No...

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.700
Why are there so many Titans?

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.380
There aren't too many people there.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.240
Could Eren be drawing them?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.530
Mikasa!

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.680
What happened to the plan?

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.810
Armin!

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.540
What happened to Eren?

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.810
It's dangerous! Move back!

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.890
Eren is completely unable to enact 
his will through that Titan!

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.300
I spoke to it, but it 
didn't recognize me!

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.630
There's no point in anyone else trying!

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.700
What about the plan?

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.200
It failed.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.220
Everyone's fighting because 
we can't leave Eren.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.060
But there are too many...

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.960
Before long, they'll wipe us out.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.260
The spot on the back of the neck,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.060
ten centimeters across and a meter high.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.710
Armin!

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.880
I'll get Eren out of here!

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.590
You protect us from any Titans!

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.880
What are you saying?

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.920
Eren came out of the 
Titan's vital point.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:00.220
It's probably related to the 
mystery behind them.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.740
Don't worry.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.140
As long as I avoid striking 
it in the center,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.330
he won't die.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.720
It'll just hurt...

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.820
a tiny bit!

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.700
Armin...

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.880
Armin, that's insane! Stop!

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.050
Mikasa, do what you can!

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.380
If you go, some lives might be saved!

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.980
Leave Eren to me!

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.270
Eren, can you hear me?

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.580
Come to your senses!

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.190
If we don't get out of 
here, we'll all die!

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.160
Don't let the Titan's body take over!

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.200
Just come out of that 
lump of flesh, now!

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.730
Come out?

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.640
Why?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.200
I'm tired...

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.720
Eren! Get out of there!

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.930
Hurry!

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.540
Eren! Eren!

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.340
What happened to avenging your mother?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.210
Aren't you going to wipe out the Titans?

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.660
Don't you hate the things 
that killed your mother?

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.130
What are you talking about, Armin?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.250
Mom's right here...

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.080
Eren! Eren!

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.920
Wake up, Eren!

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.360
You're still in there, aren't you?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.510
If we stay here, the 
Titans will kill us!

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.870
Everything will end here!

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.280
Like I said...

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.960
I don't understand you, Armin.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.390
Why do I have to leave?

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880
Yeah...

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.400
Why would I want to leave?

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.560
Why would I want to 
join the Survey Corps?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.320
Looks like we have to deviate 
from the plan, like it or not.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.340
Gotcha!

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.310
So you're finally down, bastard?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.330
Fall back for now!

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.890
I'm here.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.860
I'll join up with Mitabi's squad.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:58.870
What?!

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.740
Jean!

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.410
Hurry! Go!

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.840
I won't let anyone else 
die because of me!

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.350
Damn it... A malfunction, 
at a time like this?

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.040
Jean!

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.630
What's wrong?

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.810
Why isn't he using his Maneuver Gear?

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.110
No way... Is it broken?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.930
I'll come up with something!

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.310
Damn it.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.470
Why am I the one slowing us down?

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.070
Can I really come up with something?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.570
Eren...

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.530
Eren!

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.420
Eren!

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.330
Eren!

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.610
One day, we're going to explore 
the outside world, right?

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.300
Far beyond these walls

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.780
is flaming water! Frozen earth!

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.280

Snow-white plains of sand!

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.450
The world my mom and dad tried to see...

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.610
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.860
But the reason you stopped mentioning it

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.200
was because you didn't want me 
to join the Survey Corps, right?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.910
The outside world?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.910
Eren... Answer me!

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.750
You knew that hell was one 
step beyond the walls.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.030
You might die horribly, 
like my mom and dad did.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.310
So why did you want to go?

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.040
Why?

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.340
You know why.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.590
Because I was born into this world!

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.050
Go. Run. Live.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.270
Those words fill the air,

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.670
as many lives are lost 
on the battlefield.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.060
Eren heads for the gate, 
carrying hope with him.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.960
