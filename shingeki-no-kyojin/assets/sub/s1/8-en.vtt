WEBVTT

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.560
In the year 850...

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.940
The Colossal Titan reappeared 
and breached the wall.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.780
And once again, humanity could 
not stop a Titan invasion.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.470
Soldiers fell, one after the 
next, before the Titan assault.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.530
And then...

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.950
Eren! Hurry!

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.990
Eren fell victim to the Titans.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.630
Mikasa's amazing, though...

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.090
How does she move so fast?

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.220
No, I knew she wasn't 
her usual calm self.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.430
I'll win, no matter what.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.180
I'll live, no matter what!

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.280
When Mikasa faced certain death,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.860
a mysterious Titan appeared 
that attacked other Titans.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010
Hearing the Heartbeat 
The Battle for Trost (4)

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.550
Okay, the starter device still works.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.220
I gave you all my blades.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.570
But please let me keep this one.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.020
I don't want to be eaten alive.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.990
N-No...

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.050
Armin...

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.950
I won't leave you here.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.540
B-But...

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.130
Carrying someone,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.340
while leaping through 
a Titan-filled area—

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's go!

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.670
No...

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.480
Stop it.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.750
If you don't, I'm going to...

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.270
I'm going to cause 
another friend to die!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.610
Wait!

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.070
Listen to me...

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.360
I have a plan!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.860
A plan?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.490
You two will have to execute it,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.790
so you decide...

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.000
I know it's crazy,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.830
but could we use that Titan?

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.630
That Titan?

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.340
It attacks other Titans...

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.760
It isn't interested in us.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.970
Could we lead it to the 
supply area somehow?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.850
If it defeats the other Titans, 
everyone might be saved!

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.480
Lead it?!

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.600
How would we do that?

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.770
I think it's fighting instinctively.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.360
The two of you will defeat 
the Titans near it.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.280
That should make it move to find more.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.030
It should head toward HQ.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.250
We can't do something that 
dangerous on a hunch!

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.460
But if it works, we might be able 
to destroy all the Titans around HQ.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.920
It's worth a try.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.500
Huh?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.590
Are you serious?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.760
Better to try something than 
to simply wait for death.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.010
Let's go with Armin's plan.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.730
Fight the Titans with another Titan?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.310
Yes, that's right.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.400
If we fail, they'll laugh at us...

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.900
But if we succeed, 
everyone will survive.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.490
Let's prepare ourselves.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.410
Fine... Fine!

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.000
Do I have the right?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.260
The right to be in a 
position of responsibility?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.180
No.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.060
I have it wrong.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.760
This is the time.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.100
Now, with all those Titans 
concentrated there.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.580
This is our chance!

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.110
Now!

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.510
We run into HQ right now!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's our only chance...

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.500
Once we're out of gas, it's over.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.420
Full speed ahead!

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.640
Jean!

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.430
Thank you.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.140
Thanks to you, we made it out safely.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.130
Huh?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.890
It's thanks to you.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.310
I told you you're cut 
out for leadership!

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.610
I don't know about that!

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.160
Damn it!

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.260
How many made it?

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.480
I took advantage of our comrades' deaths.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.250
Many died at my command...

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.330
Aren't you guys with the supply team?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.660
Yeah...

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.460
Stop it, Jean!

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.750
They are the ones who abandoned us!

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.460
Because of you, more died 
than was necessary!

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.430
Titans came into the supply area...

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.090
We couldn't do anything!

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.100
Doing something is your job!

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.050
Get down!

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.570
Damn it!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.000
Too many people are in one place!

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.660
Hurry, get inside!

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.460
We can't all fit!

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.220
Where's Mikasa?!

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.580
She must've ran out of gas, 
and got eaten long ago!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.120
This is normal.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.860
This is reality...

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.760
Was my hope just an impossible dream?

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.260
I should've known....

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.500
that this is reality.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.850
It should've been a simple 
enough realization

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.570
that we could never 
beat something so huge.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.110
What?

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.790
Wh-What is that?

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.970
Mikasa?

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.820
That was close... I'm all out.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.760
But we did it! We just barely made it!

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.520
Y-You're alive!

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.690
You did it, Armin!

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.690
Ow!

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.930
Your plan worked!

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:50.900
Everyone!

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.150
That Titan is an Aberrant 
that kills other Titans!

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.240
And it isn't interested in us...

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.040
If we can use it, we can escape!

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.660
Use the Titan?

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.040
A Titan helping us?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.420
That sounds like a dream—

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.290
It isn't a dream.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.290
I don't care if it's 
an Aberrant or what...

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.990
We need it to stay here, 
and to keep fighting.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.010
That is

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.250
our most realistic chance for survival.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:34.020
Information We Can Share So Far:

3D Maneuver Gear Diagram (3) 
(Fan Unit)

of gas onto fan blades. 
Output modulated by gas pressure.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.030
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:39.030
Titan Size Comparison Chart

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.250
D-Don't worry.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.510
It's stronger than an average Titan.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.090
As long as it's out there raising hell,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.520
they won't destroy this building!

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.650
How much do you know about that Titan?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.350
We can worry about that once we get out.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.310
You're right.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.340
We'll get out of here first.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.740
We found it!

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.610
This is military police stuff...

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.030
It was covered in dust.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.600
Are scatter shots really enough?

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.170
Will these rifles

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.380
actually be of any use against the Titans?

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.050
I think they're a lot 
better than nothing.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.000
If there are still only seven 
3- to 4-meter class Titans in the supply room,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.510
even this may be enough 
firepower to blind them all at once.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.820
First, we'll use the lift to

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.690
lower a large number of people 
through the central ceiling.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.570
They'll fire in the faces of 
the seven Titans in unison to blind them.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.450
And then,

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.090
the next instant will be critical.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.410
The seven of us hidden 
among the ceiling beams

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.670
will strike the blinded Titans 
in a coordinated ambush.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:17.460
In other words, in this plan, all of our lives

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.110
will depend on this one strike.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.920
The seven must kill seven Titans 
at the same time, with a single strike.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.020
The seven will be those of us whose skills 
give us the best chance, but...

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:40.070
I'm sorry to make them bear the 
weight of everyone's lives...

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.830
It's all right.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.500
Regardless of who goes, 
everyone dies if we fail.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.070
The risk is the same.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.160
But is the plan I conceived...

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.380
really the best one?

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.710
It's our only option...

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.080
There's no time,

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.330
and this is the best plan we'll have.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.710
We just have to give all we've got!

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.990
It's fine.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.010
Have confidence in yourself.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.220
You have the ability to 
find the right solution.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.300
What?

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.720
That ability has saved both Eren and me.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.230
When was this?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.730
The lift's ready!

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.370
The guns, too!

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.730
They're all loaded!

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.510
You just don't realize it.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.110
We'll talk later.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.990
Yeah...

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.500
But can we kill Titans 
without Maneuver Gear?

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.160
Sure, we can.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.460
They're 3- to 4-meter class Titans.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.630
The target will be easy to hit.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.500
Yeah, no matter what the size,

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.820
the target is always 
that one spot on the neck...

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.370
One meter long, 
ten centimeters wide!

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.580
Or we can shove this up their ass.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.020
These are their only two weak spots.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.350
I didn't know about that!

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.020
We can do that?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.400
I'm just finding out now, too.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.760
Reiner...

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.460
Those may well end up 
being your last words.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.080
It's okay...

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.880
Their numbers haven't changed.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.220
We're still a go!

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.350
Keep calm!

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.650
Draw them in!

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.900
Wait.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.630
Avoid fighting from a disadvantage.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.740
If you don't want people to die.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.510
Finish them all with this strike!

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.060
Wait.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.220
Ready...

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.140
Fire!

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.110
Got mine!

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.940
And the others?

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.860
U-Um...

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.460
So sorry to attack...

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.290
Shit!

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.680
from behind...

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.750
Sasha and Connie...

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.170
Hurry and help them!

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.840
I'm...

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.390
So sorry!

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.490
Mikasa!

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.220
You saved me!

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:13.240
Are you injured?

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.530
No, thanks to you...

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:15.570
Then stand.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.170
Sorry...

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.660
It was nothing.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.920
Hey, now...

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.190
That was close, Annie.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.000
I'm really glad you weren't hurt.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:26.840
We got them all!

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.090
Begin the resupply.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.170
We did it!

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.390
Okay, we're saved now.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.180
The Titans aren't coming in!

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.350
It's thanks to that other 
Titan fighting them.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.610
I accepted defeat before the Titans...

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.810
I'm so ashamed!

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.610
I'll despise you all you want later!

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.860
Let's get out of here!

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.140
I don't think I'm cut 
out to be a leader...

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.600
Don't say things like that again.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.290
I hope you won't get 
mad when I say this...

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.420
But you aren't a strong person.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.260
So you can relate to how the weak feel.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.100
In addition, you excel in 
sizing up any situation.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.440
Isn't that why you immediately 
know what should be done?

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.220
You gave the right orders.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.940
That's why I could jump, 
and it's why I'm alive.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.990
You ready?

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.780
Let's get out of here!

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.740
We'll all head out together!

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.200
Scale the walls!

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.840
Rendezvous with the rest of the army! Go!

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.330
Mikasa?

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.000
Mikasa...

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.290
We have to run.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.050
That Titan...

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.420
Cannibalism?

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.390
Can it not regenerate its body?

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.650
I thought that if we could solve 
the mystery of that Titan,

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.570
it may give us a way 
to overcome our bleak predicament...

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.080
I agree.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.370
If it gets eaten, we 
won't learn anything.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:27.500
Let's try to keep it alive by 
killing the ones clinging to it.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.870
Are you insane, Reiner?!

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.500
We can finally get out of here!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.430
What if it might be able to help us?

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.260
Might it not prove a greater 
weapon than any cannon?

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.330
Help us?

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.010
Are you serious?

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.310
That's...

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.650
the Aberrant that ate Thomas...

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.350
Come on...

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.370
It doesn't need help.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.490
I guess it's finally exhausted itself...

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.490
That's enough... We're leaving.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.050
That thing couldn't possibly help us...

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:52.040
A Titan is still a Titan.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.380
What is it?

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.660
Mikasa!

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:34.890
It's Eren...

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.980
He's regained the limbs he'd lost...

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.890
I saw a Titan swallow Eren whole.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.410
I saw...

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.980
What happened?

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.580
Does this mean

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.490
that Eren did all this?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.000
I'll kill every single Titan.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.690
That strong emotion had turned 
Eren into a Titan.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:04.960
But the Garrison decides he 
is a threat to humanity,

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.280
and turns their blades on him.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.510
