00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.260
Over a hundred years ago,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.730
humanity suddenly found itself 
faced with a new predator.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.880
They were far more powerful than humans.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.670
Humanity was immediately pushed 
to the brink of extinction.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.050
The survivors built three walls:

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.480
Maria, Rose, and Sina.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.500
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.150
However...

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.990
That Day 
The Fall of Zhiganshina (2)

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.550
"For till then I was a soul in misery, alienate

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.510
From God, and covetous of all earthly things;

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.600
Now, as thou seest,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.130
here punish'd for my doting.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.560
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.700
Do spirits, converted, need.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.310
This mount inflicts

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.770
No direr penalty."

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.280
No!

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.510
Let me go!

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.430
"O avarice!

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.390
What canst thou more, 
who hast subdued our blood

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.100
So wholly to thyself, they feel no care

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.410
Of their own flesh?

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.170
O avarice!

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.100
What canst thou more, who hast—"

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.950
Eren, what are you doing?

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.890
We were so close 
to saving my mom...

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.150
Why did you do that?!

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.910
We almost saved my mom!

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.510
Get a hold of yourself!

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.850
Eren!

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.320
Eren...

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.090
The reason you couldn't save your mother

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.800
is that you lacked the strength.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.790
The reason...

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.630
The reason I didn't fight the Titan

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.090
was that I lacked the courage!

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.470
I'm sorry.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.700
Ah, it's happening again.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.130
Hurry!

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.460
To the inner gate!

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.200
Use all ships at the pier 
for Zhiganshina's evacuation!

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.950
Hurry! They'll eat you!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.310
There are small areas that protrude,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.040
like Zhiganshina, all around the wall.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.620
Their purpose is to attract the Titans,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.590
thus reducing the cost and 
manpower of defending the walls.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.980
After the people of

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.100
Zhiganshina had fulfilled their function, 
by drawing the Titans to them,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.480
they were forced to evacuate by a single gate.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.280
Don't bring anything aboard!

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.890
We're taking as many people as we can!

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.500
Armin, sit...

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.590
But...

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.390
Eren and Mikasa aren't here yet.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.980
There they are!

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.500
Eren?

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.700
Don't talk to them just now.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.790
Poor kids... 
Going by appearances, it must've been bad.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.120
Why are you just standing there?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.500
Hurry!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.340
Where are those cannon shells?!

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.320
Hurry!

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.230
They're right in front of us!

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.490
This just can't be happening...

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.540
Oh God, oh God, oh God...

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.540
Hey! What the hell?!

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.520
Wait!

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.610
Hey, what are you doing?

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.850
The ship's full!

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.010
It's leaving!

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.880
Please!

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.170
Please, at least take my child!

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.210
I'm sorry, but I can't!

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.480
Go!

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.410
Let him on!

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.640
Let us on!

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.850
You fool...

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.180
Where are you aiming?

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.240
B-But this thing doesn't 
have that kind of accuracy!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.170
Right now, I don't give a crap...

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.990
Just load the next shell!

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.080
It's hopeless!

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.690
The gate...

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.910
It's closing!

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.210
We need to retreat.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.510
We'll be left behind!

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.220
Hey!

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.190
Don't close it yet...

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.720
Wait a little more!

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.570
Many people are still in the city!

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.580
If they break through this gate,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.160
we'll lose more than a single city to the Titans!

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.080
We'll lose the entire territory within this wall!

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.700
But that doesn't mean we 
can let these people die!

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.100
Close the gate!

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.240
The Titans are coming!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.060
Get that gate shut!

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.460
Don't do it!

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.430
Hey!

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.740
What

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.760
is that thing?

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.550
Fire!

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.640
It's not working!

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.800
What is that thing?

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.400
It's coming! Run!

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.200
The Titan's coming! 
It's going to ram the wall!

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.660
Close the gate!

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.160
The gate...

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.970
Information We Can Share So Far: 
Rough Diagram of Human Territory (1) 
Diagram (see original work) broadly depicts 
area still inhabited by humans. 
Area outside Wall Maria remains a mystery.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.970
Information We Can Share So Far: 
Rough Diagram of Human Territory (2) 
Elevation increases with relative proximity
 to the center of human territory. 
Territory is rich in natural resources, 
such as water, minerals, and natural gas.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.690
Several hours after Zhiganshina's 
fall on Wall Maria's south side,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.980
the news had spread throughout

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.000
the entire human territory.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.450
Is it true?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.570
Wall Rose, South Side 
Trost District

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.140
Have Titans entered Zhiganshina?

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.450
I can't believe it...

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.160
Why would walls that have 
lasted a century fall now?

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.660
Whether you believe it or not,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.660
there are people out there who escaped by ship.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.880
At least five hundred, I'm told.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.300
The question is if we've lost Zhiganshina alone.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.970
But they would certainly never 
penetrate Wall Maria, would they?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.930
At the moment,

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.850
we should contact the central 
government and await orders.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:51.230
We cannot handle

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.630
an emergency such as this on our own.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.270
E-Excuse me!

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.320
A messenger just arrived!

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.730
They say Wall Maria has been breached! 
The Titans are invading!

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.230
It's over...

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.210
It's over.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.630
Humanity will be devoured by Titans again.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.480
It's over.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.560
I can never go home...

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.190
Why?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.930
Why did I waste my final minutes with 
her having some stupid argument?!

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.780
Now she's gone...

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.110
She's never coming back!

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.130
Why?

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.290
You lacked the strength.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.920
Because I...

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.720
Because humans are weak!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.860
Is crying all that we can do?!

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.550
I'll kill them.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.150
Eren...

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.960
What's wrong, Eren?

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.110
Eren?

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.360
I'll kill them all!

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.150
I'll wipe every one of them... 
off the face of this earth!

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.070
Eren...

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:50.610
That year, the central government decided 
to fall back within Wall Rose.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:55.620
During that period of time, 
the Titans consumed ten thousand people.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.260
Eren... Karla...

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.400
Mikasa!

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.360
Please be safe.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.560
Eren!

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.410
Eren!

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.800
Eren!

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.280
Dad!

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.150
Stop it, Dad!

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.540
What are you trying to do?!

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.900
Just give me your arm!

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.220
No!

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.210
After Mom died, you lost it...

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.420
Eren!

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.550
Let me go, Dad!

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.030
This is for your sake!

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.640
What are you talking about?

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.350
Don't forget the key.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.770
You must get there...

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.190
Someday, you'll understand!

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.480
Until you do...

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.780
Eren, are you okay?

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.270
You were tossing and turning.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.580
I feel like I saw my dad...

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.000
That can't be.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.150
It was only a dream.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.340
Was it?

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.760
Let's go.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.800
They said they're going to distribute food.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.230
This was once a food storehouse.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.480
They're keeping refugees who fled by ship here.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.680
Hey, don't cut in line!

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.540
Shut up!

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.410
I haven't eaten anything since last night!

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.630
It isn't yet certain that we'll survive.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.800
Eren!

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.550
Mikasa!

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.510
Armin...

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.040
Look...

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.400
I got here in time.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.230
My grandpa got these for us kids.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.300
Thank you.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.630
What's his problem?

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.190
There's nothing we can do...

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.310
I don't think there's enough food for everyone.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.910
They say that's all we'll get today.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.400
There are too many refugees.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.470
And not enough food to begin with.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.110
You know the farther out you live, 
the less they care, right?

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.210
Why do we have to share our food with outsiders?

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.320
If the Titans were breaking through anyway,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.050
they should have eaten more, 
so there'd be fewer mouths.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.010
Eren!

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.720
Now there's just that much less food.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.340
Ow!

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.730
What are you doing, stupid kid?

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.150
You have no idea...

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.010
You've never even seen it!

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.320
You've never seen the way they eat people...

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.990
Shut up!

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.120
I'm sorry!

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.910
He's just upset because he's hungry.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.290
That's why he's being so rude to an adult.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.380
I'm r-really sorry!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.150
Jeez...

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:19.510
The only reason you aren't starving 
is because of us, got it?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.840
Even a kid should show gratitude!

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.950
Right!

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.690
Damn it.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.650
No guy like that's looking after me...

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm going back to Wall Maria.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.280
I'm going to kill all the Titans!

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.870
Eren, you aren't serious, are you?

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:41.990
I am serious!

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.490
I'm not like them, sitting inside 
the walls and acting tough!

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.480
I don't need this!

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.460
Eren, you'll starve!

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.990
This doesn't bother you?!

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.100
We can't win until we can stop 
depending on stuff from them!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.160
It's impossible!

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.390
We can't beat the Titans, anyway.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.240
There's nothing we can do 
but live within the walls...

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.560
If you do something dumb, you'll die. 
Like my mom and dad!

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.830
So we should suck up to them instead?

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.070
Aren't you ashamed?

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.570
Right now... Right now, there's no choice!

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.240
That's just an excuse!

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.160
Then spend the rest of your 
life as cattle, weakling!

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.500
Mikasa?

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.060
If Armin is a weakling, so are we.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.590
We didn't even run from the Titans 
or from the city on our own two feet.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.560
We couldn't even get the food 
we're eating today without help.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:54.360
Anyone so weak couldn't 
possibly defeat a single Titan...

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.630
What matters is survival.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.870
Just like your mother said.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.330
Mikasa...

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.690
Eat... And survive!

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.900
I will not let you starve.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.060
Several days later,

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.580
refugees were sent in droves
to till the wastelands,

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.780
to bring in more food.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.070
But even still, there wasn't enough.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.530
And the following year, in 846,

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:44.020
the central government used many refugees

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.790
in an operation ostensibly 
to recover Wall Maria.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.550
Two hundred fifty thousand, in all...

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.890
Approximately twenty percent of the population.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.260
But there were only just 
over a hundred survivors.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:13.100
Their sacrifice alleviated the food 
shortage for the rest of us somewhat.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.540
It's all because of the Titans.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.500
If we destroy them,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.350
we can retake our home!

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:38.900
Armin...

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.190
I'm enlisting next year.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.930
I'll gain the power to fight Titans!

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:53.020
Me, too.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.190
Armin?

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.650
Me, too!

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.440
I'll go, as well.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.200
Mikasa, you don't have to...

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.120
Didn't you say that it's important to survive?

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:05.420
That's right.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.990
So I'll go, to keep you from dying.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.220
All right.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.210
The three of us.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.930
We now begin the enlistment ceremony 
for the 104th Trainee Corps!

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.800
I am Keith Shadis, and I had the 
misfortune to be assigned

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.270
to train you bastards.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.430
And I'm not here to welcome you at all!

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.010
Right now, you're mere cattle, 
fit for nothing but Titan food!

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.940
No, less than cattle...

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.490
In three years, we'll take you worthless 
pieces of crap and train you!

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.450
Give you the means to fight the Titans.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.550
In three years, when you stand before a Titan,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.540
will you still be food?

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:01.280
Or will you be a noble wall, shielding the King?

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.550
Or perhaps, one of humanity's 
glorious soldiers that slay Titans?

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.220
You will decide!

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.810
Yes...

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.270
That's what I'll be.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:16.150
And I will kill every last Titan in existence!

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.200
A failure as a soldier...

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.950
Swearing revenge against the Titans,

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.470
Eren becomes a trainee.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.010
But when he fails at basic training,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.950
he must confront a harsh reality.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.890
