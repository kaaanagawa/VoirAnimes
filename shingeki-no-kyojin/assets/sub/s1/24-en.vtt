00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.030
Armin, I'm glad I could be 
a good person to you.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.300
You've won your bet.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.820
But...

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.530
This is where <i>my</i> bet begins!

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.440
We have identified a person of interest 
who may be the Female Titan.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.430
Her name is...

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.260
Annie...

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.990
Mercy 
Raid on Stohess District (2)

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.000
Several Days Earlier

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.500
They're late...

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.020
Erwin and his men are keeping me waiting.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.560
The MP escorts will come here before they do.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.020
He's probably constipated 
and having a rough day.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.520
You're talking a lot today, Captain.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.610
Don't be stupid.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.280
I always talk a lot.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.740
I'm sorry.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.580
Back then, if I hadn't made the wrong choice...

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.370
This never would've happened.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.500
I told you...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.990
No one ever knows how things will turn out.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.970
Not at all, sir.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.470
You guys!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.980
U-Um...

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.770
We have identified a person of interest 
who may be the Female Titan.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.400
This time, we won't let her escape.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.070
The operation will be in two days.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.120
It will take place in Stohess District, 
on our way to the capital.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.280
This is our first and last chance.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.290
Once we pass that point, Eren will 
be remanded to the capital.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.380
Our pursuit of those who seek to destroy the walls 
will become fraught with difficulty.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.970
Ultimately, humanity stands to go extinct.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.220
We will stake everything on this plan.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.470
Here it is.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.860
When we pass through Stohess, 
Eren will act as a decoy,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.230
and lead the target into 
this underground tunnel.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.670
If we can get her to the lowest level,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.780
given the tunnel's size and structural integrity,

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.490
even if the target transforms, 
we can immobilize her.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.960
But if she transforms before then...

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.720
Eren, we'll need your help.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.750
Yes, sir.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.710
As for the target...

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.000
Are we sure she is in Stohess?

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.260
Yes, our target is a member 
of the Military Police.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.090
The Military Police?

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.890
It was Armin who arrived at that conclusion.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.760
He believes the target also 
killed the two captured Titans.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.690
She may be a former trainee from 
the 104th, the same as you.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.860
W-Wait a second... The 104th?

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.570
The name of the girl we believe to 
be the person of interest is...

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.610
Hey, wait...

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.590
Annie Leonhart.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.540
C-Crap...

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.130
Damn it... That ring!

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.440
She knew I was bluffing from the start.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.090
She knew we would ambush her.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.490
We must have had another way!

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.050
Save it for later.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.530
What do we need to do right now?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.730
For now, let's meet up with 
Squad 3 and get above ground.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.600
We'll follow plan B.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.250
We fight Annie... The Female Titan!

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.780
Eren transforms as planned, 
and assists in her capture!

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:07.400
You'll do it, right?

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.660
Yeah!

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240
Hey!

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.510
There's Squad 3!

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.020
Did the first capture attempt fail?

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.870
It did!

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.960
Switch to plan B!

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.400
She stomped right through the ground?!

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.270
We have to help them!

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.860
Eren...

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.620
Get back!

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.550
Hey, Mikasa...

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.980
The Female Titan's willing to let Eren die?

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.820
She made a bet...

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.840
When she created that hole, 
she bet that Eren wouldn't die.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.300
It's crazy, but it also means 
she'll be tough to beat!

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.060
To take Eren, Annie's willing 
to assume any risk!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.380
What should we do?

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.010
Our exit is gone.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.300
Even if we use our 3D Maneuver 
Gear to make a quick exit,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.960
she'll be right there waiting for us.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.450
But if we...

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.530
If we stay here, who knows when she'll crush us?

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.170
I'll do something!

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.230
Like when I blocked that cannon shell...

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.600
Come this way!

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.610
Wait!

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.700
Let's go...

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.950
Stay close!

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.750
Not again!

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.860
No...

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.930
Now, of all times...

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.120
It hurts!

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.060
You can't transform without 
a specific goal, right?

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.870
Picture it in your mind again... Clearly!

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.280
I am!

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.630
But...

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:14.990
Don't tell me...

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.190
You still have reservations about fighting Annie.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.100
Eren?

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.800
After everything you've seen,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.570
do you still think it might be all a mistake 
that Annie is the Female Titan?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.670
What did you just see?

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.580
She's the one who killed our fellow soldiers.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.680
How can you still think that?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.020
Shut up!

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.550
I'm trying, aren't I?!

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.090
Annie's the Female Titan?

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.860
Why?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.490
Why do you think that, Armin?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.220
From the start, the Female Titan 
knew what you looked like.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.580
And she reacted to your 
nickname, "suicidal bastard,"

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.020
which only the 104th trainees would know.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.090
And the biggest reason

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.540
is that I believe Annie killed the 
test subjects, Sawney and Bean.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.680
How can you tell?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.350
Only someone very skilled could have done it.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.080
And they'd have used their own Maneuver 
Gear, which they're accustomed to.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.640
Yeah, wasn't that why they 
inspected our Maneuver Gear?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.440
But they didn't find anything on Annie...

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.090
Annie brought Marco's Maneuver 
Gear to the inspection.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.640
That's why she managed 
to avoid getting caught.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.470
Huh?

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.730
What are you talking about?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.480
What does Marco have to do with this?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:48.730
I don't know.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.170
Are you sure it was his?

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.670
Yes, I know what I—

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.880
Hey, kid.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.360
We get it.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.240
Do you have any other evidence?

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.800
No, I don't.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.770
I think Annie's face resembles the Female Titan's.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.740
Huh?

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.750
What are you talking about?!

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.730
That isn't evidence—

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.020
So, you have no proof, 
but you'll do it anyway.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.190
You have no proof?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:13.380
What?

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.570
Then why do it?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.530
What if it isn't her?

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.910
Then we'll know she's innocent. That's all.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.240
And then I'll feel bad for Annie.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.080
However, if we don't do something,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.920
you'll end up being sacrificed 
to the people in the capital!

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.400
You're crazy to think Annie's a Titan.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.060
Eren, now that you know we suspect her,

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.740
isn't it ringing any bells?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.710
You fought the Female Titan.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.360
Didn't anything remind you of 
Annie's distinctive combat style?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.160
You do know, don't you?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.230
You know Annie is the Female Titan.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.220
Then we should fight her, shouldn't we?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.080
Or do you have certain feelings 
for her? Is that what's stopping you?

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.790
Huh?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.090
I have a plan!

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.350
Mikasa and I will exit at the same time, 
using the original entrance and that opening.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.100
Annie will attack one of us.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.600
Use that opportunity to get 
out from the other exit!

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.150
Wait!

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.440
Then one of you will die!

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.400
If we stay here, we all die, anyway!

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:02.170
Mikasa, take your position!

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:02.920
Right.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.920
I'll take the front.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.420
Mikasa!

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.490
Armin!

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.790
How?

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.870
How can you fight her?

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.580
How?!

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.380
We don't have a choice.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:24.770
The world is cruel.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.990
Wall Sina (1) 
Wall Sina encloses the capital and about 200,000 people. 
Residency requires special permission and is technically 
restricted to the royal family and their relatives.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.000
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.000
Wall Sina (2) 
One may also earn residency rights through meritorious 
service in the Garrison or Military Police, which is 
considered the sole means for the poor to gain safe refuge.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.660
Eren!

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.700
Annie, I won't let you have Eren!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:21.650
Eren!

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.150
Eren...

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.680
I'll get you out!

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.000
Open your eyes...

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.940
Don't let the Female Titan escape!

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.020
Don't let her get out!

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.110
What happened?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.560
Escort team, we don't need you here!

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.000
Go see what's happening!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.080
Roger!

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.630
Something's off...

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.270
That explosion I heard...

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.330
Nile...

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.800
Deploy all of your troops.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.420
We should assume a Titan has appeared.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.090
Wh-What?!

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.260
This is Wall Sina...

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.850
There's no way a Titan could be here!

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:34.810
Wait! Don't move, Jaeger!

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.480
I'm done with this disguise!

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.980
Never call me by that name again, moron!

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.900
Commander, I'm going, too.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.900
Get your equipment from Squad 4.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.900
Roger!

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.030
It's good to see that someone 
has the balls to go,

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.950
but don't forget to do your 
damnedest to stay alive.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.870
Yes, sir.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.000
Erwin, what is this?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.400
Commander, here!

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.840
Good work.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.760
Hey, Erwin!

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.320
Anyone who can move, follow me!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.340
We'll rendezvous with the capture teams.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.760
Erwin, wait.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.770
What you're doing is clearly 
treason against the crown!

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.110
Nile, I'm starting to wonder if your brains don't 
even live up to that sorry excuse of a beard.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.610
Seems to me that you don't even 
have a clue what's going on.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.160
Remove your equipment, Erwin!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.530
A Titan! A Titan's here!

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.530
What's it doing here?

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.660
Run!

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.080
Hey, isn't that a Titan?

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.000
Yeah... But how?

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.010
Out of the way!

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.050
Damn those slackers!

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.060
I could've been one of them.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.910
What the hell happened?

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.020
Damn it!

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.420
Don't attempt to kill it.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.400
Just try to slow it down!

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.330
It's no use... It knows how 
Maneuver Gear works!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.540
I'm not going to make 
this easy on you!

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.090
Eren!

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.860
Answer me! Eren!

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.100
Hey! What are you doing?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:40.850
Jean!

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.100
Eren's trapped!

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.100
The plan was for him to become a Titan!

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.170
He couldn't...

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.910
I think the fact that it's Annie is stopping him.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.990
Annie?

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.780
Anyway, we have to save him!

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.650
Jean, help me!

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.140
He couldn't transform?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.200
Eren, what the hell is wrong with you?!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.040
Didn't I once tell you that 
I'm counting on you?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.010
We have to entrust the world, 
humanity, and our lives to you,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.220
and this is how you repay us?

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.920
Marco... Marco...

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.430
Damn it!

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:30.480
Eren...

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.010
It's no use...

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.310
We have to do something about her first!

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.300
Eren, I said this once to Jean...

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:48.450
Someone who can't sacrifice anything 
can never change anything...

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.300
That to defeat monsters, you have to be

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.010
willing to throw aside your humanity.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.340
Annie is certainly capable of doing that...

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.480
although I don't know what her reasons are.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.550
But whoever can do it will win!

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.160
Annie!

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.030
If you can't kill me this time,

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.910
you can't make the same bullshit excuse 
that your bet's just beginning anymore!

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.000
Armin, this way!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.300
Roger!

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.930
It's coming...

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.020
It's coming.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.020
Squad Leader...

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.450
You have a crazy look in your eyes.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.000
Okay!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.180
I thought there'd be no need 
for a plan C, but nope...

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.260
That's Commander Erwin for you, I guess.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.980
Now, then...

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.610
Be a good girl.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.610
Stay put.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.060
Here, you're too far in to get Titans 
to devour you like before.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.070
But don't worry...

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.710
I'll be the one devouring you instead.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.760
I'll devour all the information 
that we can drag out of you.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.720
She broke free?

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.560
We needed more traps!

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.190
Don't let her escape! Follow her!

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.330
Someone who can't sacrifice anything

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.080
can never change anything!

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.460
I know that...

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.870
That's why I failed.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:38.250
I clung to my companions and 
my ties to them, and I failed.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.260
Remember...

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.310
I'll wipe you out...

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.630
No...

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:00.690
I'll kill you!

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.190
There's no time to figure out 
if this is the right thing to do!

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.250
Just move...

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.190
Don't try to keep your hands clean!

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.370
That's right...

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.540
Mikasa!

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.760
The world is cruel!

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.990
Now what?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.050
Eren!

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.850
Eren...

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.990
"I will eradicate Titans from this world."

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.460
The same fury that led Eren to make 
that vow on that fateful day

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:03.130
now spurs him on...

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.590
to destroy the entire world.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.660
The Wall 
 Raid on Stohess District (3)
