WEBVTT

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.690
In the year 845...

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.770
the Colossal and Armored Titans

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.150
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.080
along with the life we'd known.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.490
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.410
losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.960
to retreat within Wall Rose.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.840
And in the year 850, in Trost...

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.460
Once again, humanity could 
not stop a Titan invasion.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.180
Eren Jaeger had been 
devoured by a Titan,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.190
but reappeared, emerging 
from a mysterious Titan.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.000
Response 
The Battle for Trost (6)

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.960
I'll ask you once more!

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.250
What are you?!

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.520
A human!

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.510
I see...

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.050
Then don't hate me for this.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.140
Marco...

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.230
I can't...

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.580
I can't fight the Titans anymore!

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.860
What happened?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.150
My friends were eaten 
right in front of me!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.140
I saw them devoured,

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.070
and I didn't even feel sad or angry...

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.490
All I could think was, 
"I'm so glad that it wasn't me!"

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.290
But...

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.640
Next time, it'll be me...

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.960
I realized something.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.710
Essentially, our job

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.130
is to fight the Titans 
until they eat us, isn't it?

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.470
I'd rather die right now than be eaten!

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.130
Stop it...

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.300
Get a hold of yourself!

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.340
You aren't the only one.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.550
Everyone is struggling with that fear!

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.430
Look at Sasha!

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.660
Even after what happened, 
she is still a proud soldier!

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.880
I have a terrible stomachache.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.870
May I go join the wounded?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.950
I can't do this anymore!

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.950
Stop it!

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.150
Stop!

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.990
I guess that gag order 
was indeed necessary...

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.870
Just look at them now.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.020
If they learn about Eren...

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.090
A cannon shot?

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.050
Why only one?

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.640
Look! Smoke!

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.180
From inside the wall!

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.710
What?

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.940
What's going on?

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.290
Did they break through the floodgate?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.940
No way! That's the strongest part...

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.300
Someone just screwed up 
and dropped a shell.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.520
But why is there so much smoke?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.700
It can't be... A Titan's steam?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.700
Wait!

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.500
Hey...

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.060
What is going on here?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.080
It's alive...

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.460
Captain Wellman!

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.840
J-Just look at it!

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.630
It's too dangerous to get close!

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.260
Maintain your position 
and remain on high alert!

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.390
Maintain your position!

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.110
Have the gunners load another round!

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.880
What is this?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.350
I remember hearing the cannon fire...

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.560
And then there was a horrible 
sound, a shock wave, and heat...

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.600
Are we inside a huge skeleton—

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.560
Eren protected us.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.270
That's all we need to know for now.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.990
Flowers survived, only inside...?

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.910
Hey!

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.790
Are you guys okay?!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.580
Eren!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.460
What is this?

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.160
No idea...

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.630
But this thing will soon dissipate 
like any other Titan corpse...

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.670
Let's get away from it!

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.320
Are they in shock, or just 
waiting to see what we'll do?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.150
The Garrison isn't doing 
anything right now, but...

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.590
They'll attack again before long.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.500
After showing them this, I doubt we'll 
be able to talk our way out.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.170
But I do remember one thing...

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.600
The basement.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.110
The basement of my house.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.850
Dad said that if I go there, 
I'll learn everything.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.450
This happened to me because of him, too.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.340
If I go to the basement,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.880
I'll probably learn what 
the Titans really are.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.170
Damn it!

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.170
Then why did he hide it?

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.970
Isn't that information

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.720
what thousands of Survey 
Corps soldiers died for?

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.240
Isn't it humanity's last hope?

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.130
And he's been keeping it locked 
in the basement of our house?

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.610
What the hell was he thinking?

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.630
Where the hell has he been 
the past five years, anyway?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.110
Eren.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.270
Right now, we have other priorities.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.740
Yeah.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.370
The smoke's clearing.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.370
When you see them, attack.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.380
Let's end this here.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.920
Don't move yet!

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.810
I'm getting out of here.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.020
Where will you go? And how?

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.850
For now, I don't care where.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.310
But from there, over the walls, 
to the basement.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.480
Once I become a Titan again.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.140
Can you do that?

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.280
I don't know how I do it myself.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.420
But I still think I can!

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.370
It's similar to the way you can't explain 
how you move your own arm.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.260
Back there,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.970
my only thought was stopping that shell.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.380
So that body had no other function and 
rotted away after having served its purpose.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.720
This time, I'll turn 
into something stronger.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.180
A 15-meter class, like the one 
that tore apart those Titans.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.160
Eren.

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.150
Your nose is bleeding.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.500
You look pale, and your 
breaths are ragged.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.440
Your body is in bad shape!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.820
How I feel doesn't matter.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.870
I've come up with two options.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.990
First, if you don't try to protect me, 
at least they won't kill you.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.540
Although I've already 
caused you trouble.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.050
I'm thinking of leaving here alone.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.380
No...

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.820
I'll go, too—

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:36.820
Eren,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.970
I'm coming with you.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.930
No!

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.470
If I can't keep up, you don't 
need to worry about me.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.620
But I don't have to do what you say.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.980
I've told you to stop all that!

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.580
I'm not your little brother, 
and I'm not a child!

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.990
Yeast (1) 
A special yeast made only within Wall Sina keeps 
fodder, wheat, beans, and other items from spoiling 
for a long time when placed in storerooms or tents.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.990
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.990
Yeast (2) 
By seeding storage caches with 
this yeast along supply lanes, 
humanity prepares to retake Wall Maria.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.040
Captain, the next round 
will be loaded soon.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.670
Should we attack again?

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.360
Wait for my signal!

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.340
Yes, sir.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.010
The Garrison's giving no indication of 
moving to attack with their blades.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.390
Mikasa's more sensitive than 
a stray cat to those things.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.590
Loading the next round will probably take

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.230
a minimum of another twenty seconds.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.400
Before then, Eren will have 
made his move and left...

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.760
Why would I remember these 
things at a time like this?

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:52.080
Is it because this is it for us?

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.380
And at the end, I was

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.240
nothing more than a coward, after all...

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.060
They saved me over and over,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.350
but I was never able to save them.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.530
As a friend, how can I stand 
on equal ground with them?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.860
How could I say I'd go with them?

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.850
When even I'm not sure I can?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.630
Now, the three of us

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.650
will probably never 
be together again...

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.240
Eren, I...

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.560
Wait, Mikasa.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.300
I said I've come up with two options.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.760
Armin,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.650
I'll let you decide.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:59.390
Huh?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:03.830
I know what I've just 
said isn't that realistic.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.450
The smartest thing to do

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.050
would be to stay with the troops 
and use this ability strategically.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.420
I know it's crazy...

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:20.370
But if you think you can convince 
the Garrison I'm not a threat right now,

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.030
I will trust your judgment and follow your lead.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.430
That's my second option.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.810
If you say you can't, I'll do 
what I described before.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.520
You have fifteen seconds to decide.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.970
Whether or not you can,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.330
I'll respect your decision.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.410
Eren...

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.070
Why would you entrust 
me with this choice?

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.020
Whenever things get really bad,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.010
you always know the right thing to do.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.960
And I want to rely on you.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.460
When have I...

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.580
There have been plenty of times.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.000
Five years ago, if you 
hadn't called Hannes,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.430
Titans would have eaten Mikasa and me.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.740
Was it all...

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.130
just in my head?

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.680
Only I thought that I was useless? 
That I was just slowing them down?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.760
These two never thought 
that for a second!

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.200
Armin, we're out of time!

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.760
Looks like the next round is loaded.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.510
We can fire any time.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.190
These two are putting 
their lives in my hands.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:56.130
The two people I trust 
most in the world...

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.290
What could be more convincing than that?

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.970
I will persuade them.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.980
The two of you, avoid doing anything 
that'd make them think you're a threat.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.890
Ever since Eren became 
a Titan and fought for us,

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.650
something has been bothering me.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.970
I don't have it all clear in 
my head, but I'll do this!

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.220
I'll figure it out while I speak!

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.850
Stop!

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.960
You've finally shown 
your true self, monster!

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.820
I'll do it!

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:44.980
I'll give the signal!

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.710
He is not an enemy of humanity!

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.200
We are prepared to share 
all the information we have!

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.530
I'm not interested in hearing 
you plead for your lives!

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.210
How can I believe you, when he's 
shown us all what he really is?

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.390
If you say he's not an 
enemy, then prove it!

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.460
If you can't, I'll be forced 
to eliminate the threat!

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.790
There is no need for proof!

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.600
That's right... We don't.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.630
The question isn't what we think of him!

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.470
What did you say?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.480
I'm told that many of you saw him!

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.040
Then you saw him fighting the Titans!

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.520
And you saw the Titans swarm him!

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:32.700
That means the Titans considered him 
food, the same way they think of us!

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:37.700
<i>That</i> is the truth, no matter 
what we may think or believe!

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:43.330
He's right...

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.950
A Titan as an ally?

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:46.340
That's impossible.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.340
But if we could control a Titan...

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.220
Prepare to attack!

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.460
Don't be fooled by their clever lies!

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.810
The Titans' actions have always 
been beyond our understanding!

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.030
It's possible they could 
pretend to be human,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.530
speak human languages, 
and try to deceive us!

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.370
We can't let them get 
away with anything else!

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.520
No...

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.120
He isn't even trying to think!

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.100
He's scared of thinking!

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.290
Eren... Mikasa!

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.390
I am a soldier!

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.310
I swore long ago to dedicate 
my life to the revival of humanity!

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.780
If that pursuit were to cost 
me my life, I would be glad!

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.740
If we use his Titan powers and 
the forces we still have,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.900
we could take back this town!

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.160
With my final breath before my death,

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.960
I shall wish for humanity's glory,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.130
and try to persuade you 
of his strategic value!

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.050
Captain Wellman, I believe 
we should consider—

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.420
Shut up!

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.160
Their pleas are irrelevant.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.030
They are traitors.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.020
Anyone who violates the 
rules must be eliminated.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.940
That is my duty as a soldier!

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:32.650
Enough.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.660
As big as you are, you've always been 
as delicate as a newborn fawn.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.190
Commander Pixis!

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.370
Do you not see his splendid salute?

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.270
I've just arrived, but messengers have 
kept me abreast of the situation.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.000
You go command the reinforcements.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:02.260
I think we should listen to them...

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.000
Reports by the Survey Corps had said

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.770
the Titans would come from the south.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:19.430
In fact, it was Zhiganshina District,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:22.390
south of Wall Maria, that was attacked.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.540
Thus, it was widely believed that 
the district south of Wall Rose,

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.450
Trost, had the highest likelihood 
of being the next target.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.390
Trost District, Inner Gate

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.280
Dot Pixis...

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.930
He is the High Commander

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.140
of the entire southern region, including Trost.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.370
The man with absolute authority over

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.190
the defense of humanity's most important region.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.980
No luck, huh?

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.800
I wouldn't mind being eaten by a 
really beautiful Titan woman.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.200
And he is known to be a total eccentric.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.830
What is the Commander thinking?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.460
Allowing them up there unguarded,

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.710
when we don't know what they are...

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.130
I don't know.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.430
The Commander's ideas are always 
beyond normal people's comprehension.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.590
Captain...

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.450
The squads are in formation.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.720
Oh, excellent.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.820
I see.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.520
And if we reach this basement, 
we'll understand everything?

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.770
Yes... Will you believe me?

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.320
As long as you, yourself, 
lack absolute conviction,

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.390
I can't promise more than 
that I'll keep it in mind.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:48.700
But I do take pride in being able to 
recognize the truth of what I see.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.500
I'll guarantee your safety.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.730
Trainee Arlert, was it?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.770
Yes, sir!

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.760
Back there, you said we could use

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.880
the Titan's power to reclaim this city.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.140
Did you really think so?

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.270
Or was it just a plea to save your life?

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:13.670
Well...

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:15.810
Both.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.350
What I meant was to have

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.990
Eren become a Titan, 
then move that boulder

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.930
to seal the destroyed gate.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.500
But it was just an idea...

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.400
I thought I could get them to at least

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.760
at least consider using Eren's power 
to find a way out of our predicament.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.520
Of course, I wanted to survive!

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.300
You wanted to survive.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.050
I can trust those words 
more than any others.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.610
Well, Trainee Jaeger?

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.200
Yes?

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.870
Can you seal that hole?

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.100
Well... Well...

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.230
I don't know.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.520
I don't know much more than 
everyone else here does.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.500
So... whether I can do it or not,

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.730
I can't answer you for 
sure when I don't know.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.170
That's true.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.500
I'm sorry.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.910
I asked the wrong question.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.850
Will you do it? Or won't you?

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.660
I'll do it.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:09.550
I'll do it!

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.510
I don't know whether 
I can seal the hole...

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.320
But I'll do it!

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:56.740
Although they had fled out of fear,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.770
soldiers choose to stand 
once more on the battlefield.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:05.600
Eren decides to become everyone's hope.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.300
