00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.430
Over a hundred years ago,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.670
humanity suddenly found itself 
faced with a new predator.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.090
They were far more powerful than humans.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.540
Humanity was immediately pushed 
to the brink of extinction.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.010
The survivors built three walls:

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.520
Maria, Rose, and Sina.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.410
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.030
However...

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.970
In the year 845...

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.230
the Colossal and Armored Titans,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.420
along with the life we'd known.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.540
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.540
losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.250
to retreat within Wall Rose.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.370
In the year 850...

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.000
The Colossal Titan reappeared and breached the wall,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.010
allowing the Titans to invade yet again.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.070
Eren! Hurry!

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.690
Two hours later, the population had 
been successfully evacuated.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.660
No one was lost to the Titans.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.620
No one except the soldiers

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.370
who had gone to intercept them.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.870
Eren...

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.310
As long as I have you,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130
I can do anything.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.980
The Small Blade 
The Battle for Trost (3)

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.480
Wait, Captain!

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.860
If the Titans attack,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.070
we supply troops won't be able 
to protect this place alone.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.160
Please! Stay here!

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.870
Out of the way.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.000
I must organize the reinforcement squads.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.000
Within the inner gate, where it's safe?

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.300
What are you trying to say?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.380
This is our procedure!

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.050
It is our duty as soldiers 
to follow procedure!

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.260
B-But if this place falls—

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.760
Silence!

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.350
Another word, and I'll be forced

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.600
to deem you traitors 
and punish you right here!

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.200
I heard the bell sound a temporary retreat.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.910
Why does no one try to climb the walls?

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.100
It's over...

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.430
It's all over.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.740
Got it.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.200
What good will that do?

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.000
Hey, Jean! What should we do?

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.170
There's nothing we can do...

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.220
They finally issued the order to retreat,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.510
but without more gas, we can't climb the walls.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.540
So we're all going to die...

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.270
Because of those cowards.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.310
The supply team...

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.560
What happened to them?!

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.810
Were they wiped out?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.400
They're too terrified to move.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.440
I can see why...

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.500
But abandoning their mission to resupply us,
 to hide inside HQ? Unbelievable.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.450
And sure enough,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.490
the Titans have swarmed them, 
so we can't go get more gas...

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.780
Then we must take a chance,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.000
and try to destroy the Titans around HQ!

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.920
We won't be any worse off than sitting here...

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.000
The Titans will be here before long!

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.720
And if we keep running, 
we'll just waste the gas we have.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.800
Without use of our Maneuver Gear, 
we really are done for!

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.570
I'm surprised to see you using 
your head for once, Connie.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.100
But do you think we can do that, 
given our numbers here?

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.480
Most of the veterans in the 
vanguard were killed.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.490
Which of us trainees could lead 
a suicide mission like that?

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.990
Well, even if someone could, 
we can't fight the Titans.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.870
I bet the gas supply room 
is chock full of 3- to 4-meter class Titans.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.460
Obviously, we can't refuel with them around.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.010
So we're doomed?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.830
What a stupid life...

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.800
If I'd known this would happen, 
I would've told them.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.020
Let's do it, guys!

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.520
Come on, stand up...

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.100
If we all work together, we'll be fine!

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.110
I'll take the lead.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.950
Armin, let's all...

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.040
Reiner,

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.440
what should we do?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.460
Nothing yet.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.260
If we do it, we do it all together.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.000
It's hopeless...

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.850
There's no way any of us can 
make it out of this town alive.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.560
I knew I could die...

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.520
But what am I dying for?

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.560
Mikasa?

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.440
I thought you were with the rearguard.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.820
Annie!

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.030
I have a basic idea of what's happening.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.950
And I'm sorry to involve my personal feelings,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.950
but did you see Eren's team?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.200
I didn't see them,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.790
but no one's made it up the walls.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.030
Actually, Armin's over there.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.040
Armin!

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:08.670
Mikasa!

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:10.130
No!

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.180
How am I supposed to face her?

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.110
I survived for nothing.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.680
I wish I'd died back there with him!

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.980
Armin, are you hurt?

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.610
Are you okay?

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.780
Where is Eren?

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:39.330
Armin?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:56.800
The members of Trainee Corps team 34...

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.380
Thomas Wagner, Nack Tias,

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.390
Milius Zermusky, Mina Karolina...

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.980
Eren Jaeger!

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.890
These five died valiantly in the line of duty!

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.280
No...

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.870
Team 34 was almost wiped out, then?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.790
If we try to face the Titans, 
the same will happen to us.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.630
I'm sorry, Mikasa...

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.380
Eren... He sacrificed himself for me.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.010
I...

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.260
I couldn't do anything!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.890
I'm sorry...

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.270
Armin.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.980
Calm down.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.130
This isn't the time to get emotional.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:56.860
Eh?

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.640
Now, stand up.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.910
Marco, if we eliminate the Titans swarming HQ,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.710
then we can refuel and climb the walls.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.920
Isn't that right?

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.170
That's right, but...

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.730
But even with you here, there are too many...

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.630
I can do it.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.590
Huh?

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.800
I am strong!

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.490
Stronger than you guys.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.180
Very strong.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.100
Therefore, I can defeat those Titans!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.400
Even on my own.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.690
You are not only weak,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.280
but you are spineless cowards.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.240
I am disappointed in you.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.240
Just stay here...

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.910
Stay here and watch.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.370
Hey, Mikasa! What are you saying?!

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.600
You're going to fight all 
those Titans by yourself?!

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.340
There's no way you can do that!

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.210
If I can't, I'll die.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.380
But if I win, I'll live.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.300
If I don't fight, I can't win.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.180
Wait!

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.980
What's disappointing here is your vocabulary...

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.070
Was that supposed to be 
an inspirational speech?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.940
This is your fault, Eren!

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:19.570
Listen up!

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.120
Were we trained to let our 
fellow soldiers fight alone?!

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.870
Do you really want to become cowards?!

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.700
I wouldn't want that.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.300
Come on, coward...

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.340
Wimp...

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.510
Idiot!

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.260
Those guys...

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.180
Damn it... I'll do it!

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.520
Hurry!

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.270
Follow Mikasa!

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.320
We do this fast.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.110
We need to storm HQ 
before our gas runs out!

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.030
Mikasa's amazing, though...

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.740
How does she move so fast?

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.790
No, she's using too much gas!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.000
She'll run out fast!

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.120
No matter how good you are,

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.460
without the Maneuver Gear, you're helpless!

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.430
I knew she wasn't her usual calm self.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.560
She's trying to ignore 
her shock by taking action!

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.930
At this rate, she'll...

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.230
Mikasa!

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.110
Damn it!

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.740
Jean, you take over.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.360
I'll go after Armin!

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.330
I will, too.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.280
What are you doing?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.990
The Titans are still out there!

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
We need your skills!

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.930
Again...

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.010
This, again.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.220
I lost my family once more...

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.030
Do I have to remember the pain again,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.610
and start over again from here?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
3D Maneuver Gear Diagram (1)
 (Maneuver Gear Main Unit) 
Houses the wires.
Contains two independent 
rotational axes.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.010
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.010
3D Maneuver Gear Diagram (2)
(Control System)
A black box. A closely guarded 
secret by its engineers. 
  (Cylinder Unit) 
Contains compressed gas.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.680
It's hopeless...

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.800
We can't even get close to HQ.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.140
Not unless we're willing to risk casualties.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.150
Damn! He's out of gas!

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.150
Stay back!

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.610
Tom, I'm coming for you!

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.280
Don't...

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.530
It's too late!

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.080
Don't—

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.000
Why couldn't I stop them?

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.300
Why didn't I stop them?

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.600
If I had forced them to stop,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.530
this wouldn't have happened...

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.900
Do I have the right

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.400
to hold a position of responsibility?

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.530
No!

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.750
Please, no!

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.300
No!

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:54.890
I don't want to die!

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.800
This world is cruel.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.510
And also

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.300
very beautiful.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.780
It was a good life.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.340
What?

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.630
Why?

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.520
I thought I'd given up.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.940
Why do I keep standing up?

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.110
Why am I struggling?

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.710
To what end?

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.960
There's no point

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.760
in living anymore.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.260
What is driving me?

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.270
Fight!

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.810
Fight... Fight!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.030
Eren.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.560
Fight...

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.980
Fight!

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.490
Fight...

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.450
Fight!

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:57.580
I'm sorry, Eren.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.660
I won't give up anymore.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.370
I'll never give up again.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.590
Once I'm dead,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.760
I won't even be able to remember you.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.260
So I'll win, no matter what.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.300
I'll live, no matter what!

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.070
What happened?

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.350
A Titan

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.140
killing

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.440
another Titan?

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.800
Please, Mikasa... Be safe!

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:39.090
Mikasa!

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.120
Mikasa, are you hurt?

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.980
Are you two okay?

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.690
Yeah!

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.570
We need to move!

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.240
Oh, no! Two 15-meter class Titans!

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.870
No, that Titan...

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.540
H-He finished it off?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.530
He knew where to hit it, to kill it?

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.260
We've gotta move

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.120
before it comes after us!

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.510
No. It's showing no interest in us...

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.350
Even though it should've attacked us by now.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.430
It appeared to know 
rudimentary combat skills, too.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.270
What is it?

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.650
We just have to assume it's another Aberrant!

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.400
We know barely anything about them...

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.530
Anyway, let's get to HQ.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:20.900
Wait!

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.610
Mikasa's out of gas.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.030
Huh?!

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.450
Hey, seriously?

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.280
What are we supposed to do without you?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.290
There's only one thing to do...

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.120
I don't have much left, either.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.540
But we need to exchange the canisters, now!

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:35.630
Armin!

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.380
There's no other choice!

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.340
There's no point in my having them.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.670
But...

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.010
Don't waste it this time.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.350
Use it to save everyone.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.980
I led everyone into battle without 
being willing to protect them.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.230
And for a minute, I gave up on living,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.280
not feeling responsible 
for them in the least.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.990
And all for personal reasons...

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.490
I...

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.200
Okay, the starter device still works.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.580
I gave you all my blades.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.540
But please let me keep this one.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.010
I don't want to be eaten alive.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.890
N-No...

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180
Armin...

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.980
I won't leave you here.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:48.490
At the time,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.660
I was filled with confusion.

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:58.000
I'd never heard of a Titan 
killing another Titan.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.600
I also felt a glimmer of exhilaration.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.680
I felt

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:13.270
the rage of humanity itself 
was embodied in what I saw.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.580
A Titan that slays other Titans.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.830
The 104th Trainee Corps members are shocked 
into stunned silence by the spectacle.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:06.300
And soon, they see...

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.820
Hearing the Heartbeat 
The Battle for Trost (4)
