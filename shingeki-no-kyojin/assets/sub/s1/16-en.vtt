00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.990
What Should Be Done 
Night Before the Counteroffensive (3)

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.830
When did you last change shafts?

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.170
Six days ago.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.660
After the clean-up operation.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.350
Just as the records say.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.380
Okay, next.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.170
You...

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.500
Krista Lenz, squad 42.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.530
Check for wear.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.180
Guess you can be punished for killing Titans...

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.810
It's weird, but those were valuable test subjects.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.020
Sure, but why look for the 
culprit among us trainees?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.980
Yeah. We just finished the 
battlefield clean-up today.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.450
Everyone's exhausted.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.460
They must've really hated Titans.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.340
Yeah.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.780
But in reality, they've 
ended up helping the Titans...

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.790
Their desire for vengeance 
may have been fulfilled,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.960
but it's a blow to humanity.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.650
I think I kind of get why they did it 
because I'm also an idiot...

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.130
Before I saw the Titans,

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.090
I seriously planned to join the Survey Corps.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.140
But I never want to see another.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.790
And today, we have to decide which force to join.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.360
Even Jean's seriously...

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.710
Everyone's regretting it.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.420
If I'd known it'd be this hellish,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.050
I'd have never chosen to be a soldier.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.420
Now that I'm exhausted,

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.920
it's all I can think about...

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.350
Hey, Marco...

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.610
I can't even tell which are your bones anymore.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.430
If I hadn't become a soldier,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.250
I wouldn't have to think about 
who'll be on that pile next.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.180
Will we abandon the tactics that cost 
tens of thousands of lives to develop,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.540
and let the Titans eat us without a fight?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.840
I know we have to fight...

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.150
But not everyone is as eager to die as you.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.560
I hope you won't get mad when I say this...

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.560
But you aren't a strong person.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.660
So you can relate to how the weak feel.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.270
In addition, you excel in 
sizing up any situation.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.650
Isn't that why you immediately 
know what should be done?

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.090
What should be done...

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.640
Hey, guys...

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.970
Have you decided which one you're joining?

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.020
I have.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.350
I...

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.530
I...

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.940
I'm joining the Survey Corps!

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.700
Damn it.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.970
Hey, Annie, what did you think?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.940
Even Jean said he's joining the Survey Corps.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.840
Huh? Jean said that?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.720
Nothing in particular.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.260
You're joining the Military Police right?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.790
Maybe I should, too.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.170
If someone told you to die, would you do it?

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.230
What? Of course not.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.630
Then why not make your own decision?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.820
Armin, what about you?

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.740
I...

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.830
I think if you know why you have to die,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.490
there are times when you simply must.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.260
Not that I want to.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.590
I see... You've made your choice.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.380
Yeah.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.960
I've been thinking about 
doing it for a long time.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.420
Seriously? Armin, you, as well?

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.260
You're weak, but you have guts.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.760
Th-Thank you.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.010
Annie, you're actually pretty nice, aren't you?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.520
It seems like you don't want 
us to join the Survey Corps.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.030
Isn't there a reason you want 
to join the Military Police?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.740
Not really.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.820
It's only

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.120
that I want to survive.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.740
It looks like they didn't find 
any soldiers who've used

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.640
their Maneuver Gear without permission.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.510
Then who did it?

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.220
No idea...

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.180
Right now, I'm more worried about 
the upcoming induction ceremony.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.550
How many among the new troops 
will be crazy enough to join us?

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.990
Hey, Eren...

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.070
Are there any in your class 
who will request to join us?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.270
There are.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.000
No, there were.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.910
I don't know about now.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.200
Attention!

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.370
Get ready.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.500
We're going out on patrol.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.210
Yes, sir!

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.970
Good morning, Captain Levi!

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.200
Listen, Eren...

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.510
Never fall two horse lengths behind me.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.340
Don't forget that the only reason

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.970
you're not locked up is because I'm watching you.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.840
Yes, sir!

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.640
Let's go.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.170
Jean...

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.260
You're really joining the Survey Corps?

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.880
Yeah.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.910
Why, all of a sudden?

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.080
I mean... Aren't you scared?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.710
Huh?

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.270
Of course I don't want to join the Survey Corps.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.540
Th-Then why...

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.190
It isn't that I decided the Titans don't scare me.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:25.670
And I won't say something like, 
"The best should join the Survey Corps."

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.550
I'm not as eager to die as some.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.150
You mean Eren?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.180
He already joined the Survey Corps.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.000
Trainees, line up!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.660
Line up before the stage!

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.070 line:20%
Line up before the stage!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.960
I'm not risking my life because 
someone convinced me.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.540
This is a job you can't do unless 
you decide for yourself.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.870
I am Erwin Smith, Commander of the Survey Corps.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.400
Today, you will choose a military branch.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.530
Put bluntly, I'm here to persuade 
you to join the Survey Corps.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.580
During the Titan attack,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.360
you learned how terrifying they can be.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.790
And how limited your own power is.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:22.120
However...

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.850
This battle brought humanity

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.530
closer to victory than it's ever been.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.380
Through Eren Jaeger's existence.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.760
By risking his own life, he's proven himself,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.220
without doubt, a friend to humanity.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.690
With his help, not only did we 
stop the Titans' advance,

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.360
but we have a way to discover their true nature.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.490
We believe that in the basement 
of his Zhiganshina home,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.250
there are answers about the Titans 
that he himself doesn't have.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.500
If we can reach that basement,

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:11.340
we will find a clue that will end 
this century of Titan rule.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.710
The basement?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.800
We've already advanced that far?

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.100
If we learn what they are, we can end this!

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.920
No matter how much he wants recruits,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.520
I can't believe he's publicizing this information.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.750
Or does he have some hidden motive?

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:35.380
What is he trying to see?

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.030
Branch Selection (1) 
After three years of training, a ceremony 
is held in which trainees choose among the 
Garrison, Survey Corps, or Military Police.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.040
Information We Can Share So Far:

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.040
Branch Selection (2) 
However, only the top ten can enter the 
Military Police, so the choice is limited to the 
Survey Corps or the Garrison. Most select the Garrison.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.100
We will head for the basement in Zhiganshina.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.090
However, that requires us to retake Wall Maria.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.180
In other words, our objective hasn't changed.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.710
But with the Trost gate sealed,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.300
we'll have to take the long way 
around, from Karanes to the east.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.270
The four years we spent laying a route

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.740
for a large army have gone to waste.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.450
In those four years,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.750
more than sixty percent 
of the Survey Corps lost their lives.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.530
Sixty percent in four years...

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.430
An insane figure.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.000
Any trainees who join

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.590
will participate in our excursion 
beyond the walls, in a month.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.260
We expect thirty percent won't return.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.140
In four years, most will be dead.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.530
But those who survive

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.680
will become superior soldiers 
with a high survival rate.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.270
Knowing these discouraging facts,

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.280
any still willing to risk their lives, remain here.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.280
Ask yourself...

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.030
Are you willing to offer your 
beating heart for humanity?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.340
That is all.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.540
Anyone who wishes to join another 
branch is dismissed.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.920
Commander...

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.930
Don't you think you scared them a little much?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.430
All of them will leave!

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.700
Damn it...

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.750
Come on, you already decided!

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.750
Don't make me hate myself any more...

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.760
If I don't leave now, I'll have 
to face them again.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.720
I left the village to join the Military Police...

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.760
My mom will be happy.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.690
If I join the Military Police, the whole 
village will think better of me.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.650
We all already know...

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.360
We've seen it...

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.820
How the Titans...

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.320
...eat humans!

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.640
Can you die if you're ordered to?

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.640
I don't want to die!

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.310
I see.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:02.570
I like the looks on your faces.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.030
Then I welcome everyone 
here to the Survey Corps!

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.500
This is a true salute!

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.580
Offer up your hearts!

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.600
Everyone...

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.990
This is terrible.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.490
The Survey Corps...

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:27.970
I'm scared!

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.480
I want to go home...

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.580
I don't even care.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.690
If you were going to cry, you should have left.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.560
You have done well to endure your fear.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.790
You are brave soldiers.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.590
You have my heartfelt respect.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.200
Salute!

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.790
I'm Squad Leader Ness.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.350
And this is Shallot, my horse.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.200
She loves to chew off your hair,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.300
so be careful if you don't want to be bald.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.390
Nice to meet you all!

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.970
Hey! S-Stop it, Shallot!

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.840
Hey, someone grab her!

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.970
Our training began the next day.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.210
Instead of practical training, 
it was mostly memorizing the

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.980
long-range scouting formation 
Commander Erwin had devised.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.530
Strangely,

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.860
while it was written in exacting detail,

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.780
Eren Jaeger's position was nowhere to be found.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.610
You new recruits will be here.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.250
You'll be between the cart guard team

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.960
and the recon support team.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.950
Your job will be to ride alongside the 
spare horses and relay messages.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.710
The Special Operations Squad will be here.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.320
Standing by in the center of the last ranks.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.970
We're pretty far back.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.900
It's the safest place in the formation.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.490
We're even better protected 
than the supply carts.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.310
Well, this time, our goal is 
just to go out and return.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.480
This expedition is so short

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.530
because it's a practice run for 
your journey to Zhiganshina.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.360
Um...

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.340
I still don't know what this 
power should be used for...

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.670
Did you understand what the 
Commander's question meant?

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.870
What do you think the enemy is?

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.980
Did you all understand?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.940
No...

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.320
It may be a lie to claim 
we understand everything.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.150
But I think—

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.300
It's possible this mission has another goal.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.300
But the Commander decided

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.170
it was best not to reveal that
 fact to the soldiers.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.480
So we should just focus on 
getting there and back.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.840
Believe in the Commander.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.830
Right...

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.170
That's all the training for today.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.390
Prepare to go back.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.390
Th-That's...

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.820
Sir, may I go talk with my classmates?

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.800
Get going...

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.780
Hey, Mikasa! Armin!

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.010
Eren...

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.750
Feels like it's been a long time!

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.290
Eren, did they do anything bad to you?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.520
Like investigating every square inch of you?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.830
Or psychological torture?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.040
No way.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.590
That short guy went too far.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.090
Someday, I'll see him pay for it.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.530
You don't mean Captain Levi, do you?

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.690
Hey, Eren...

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.160
It's been so long!

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.290
What? Everyone's here?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.060
But if you're here, then...

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.170
That doesn't mean you joined 
the Survey Corps, does it?

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.820
Is there any other reason we'd be here?

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.780
So only Jean, Annie, and Marco 
joined the Military Police?

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.390
No way... Not you, too!

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.280
Marco's dead.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.100
What was that?

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.950
Did you say Marco's dead?

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.550
Seems not everyone gets a dramatic death.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.450
I don't even know how he died.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.570
He died without anyone knowing, or anyone seeing.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.270
Marco...

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.440
Hey, new kids, get over here!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.450
Your uniforms are here!

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.230
Are you really...

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.450
Yes, we'll also be participating in the mission.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.410
Hey, Eren.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.830
I heard that when you turned into 
a Titan, you tried to kill Mikasa.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.650
What does that mean?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.050
No. Eren was trying to hit a fly...

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.500
I wasn't asking you.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.790
Mikasa, it looks like the wound 
on your cheek is pretty bad.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.370
When did you get that?

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.930
I've heard it's true.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.340
When I became a Titan, 
I tried to kill Mikasa.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.520
If you heard, then you don't remember it, right?

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.130
In other words, you had no idea 
you even had this Titan power,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.990
and you don't have the means to control it.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.890
Yes, that's right.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.580
Did you hear that?

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.240
This is the situation.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.310
Humanity and our lives depend on him.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.000
We'll probably die just like Marco,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.320
without Eren ever realizing it.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.570
Jean, what's the point in asking 
Eren these questions now?

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.220
Listen, Mikasa.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.390
Not everyone's like you,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.000
willing to die for Eren's sake 
with nothing in return...

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.900
We should know what we're dying for.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.510
Otherwise, we will hesitate 
when the time comes.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.160
We want something in return from him.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.520
So let me see what he has to offer.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.290
And whether it's worth my life.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.460
So, Eren...

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:06.450
I'm really counting on you.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.430
Right.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.960
Sir, it's almost time.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.460
We've driven away all the Titans in the area.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.880
Thirty seconds until we open the gate!

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.600
It's the Survey Corps!

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.100
They call the emblem on their 
back the Wings of Freedom!

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:38.870
So cool...

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.310
It's time!

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.570
Humanity will take another step forward.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.160
Show me what you can do!

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.940
Open the gate!

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.220
Advance!

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.100
We will now begin the 57th 
expedition beyond the walls!

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.160
Onward!

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.440
Entering long-range scouting formation,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.010
the Survey Corps advances beyond the walls.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.310
However, they suddenly encounter

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.620
a mysterious Titan that possesses intelligence.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:27:00.000
