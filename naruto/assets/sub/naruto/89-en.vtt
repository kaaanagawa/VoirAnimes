WEBVTT

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.520
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.020
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.650
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.230
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.650
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.650
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.310
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.150
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.440
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.810
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:58.100
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.690
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.270
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.770
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.400
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.980
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.690
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.270
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.480
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.230
Okay! Let’s go!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.350
Huh?

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.230
"Let's go,"
with so much energy…

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.520
Don't act like a little kid!

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480
Oh? You’re in a bad mood.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.690
Because! Because!
lt's in the middle of my training!

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.890
There are three steps
in the training, right?!

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.650
I’m only done with the second step!

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.190
You can do the third step
even while walking.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.190
What! Really?!

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.650
A balloon?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:27.890
Here!

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.890
What’s this…?
An ordinary balloon?

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.900
The first step is “Spin.”
The second step is “Power.”

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.310
And finally, the third step is this.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.190
An Impossible Choice:
The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.520
Which one is “this”?!

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.770
Watch me, it looks as if
I am simply holding a balloon…

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.310
You say it “looks as if,”
but nothing is really happening.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.400
Then, I will do the same thing
on my left hand.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.850
Let’s see what’s really happening
inside the balloon.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:43.900
Wow!

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.890
The Chakra is randomly spinning
and going faster and faster…

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.560
But still, it’s perfectly round…
lt’s almost like…

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.270
Like a small typhoon, right?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.980
What’s happening in your left hand…

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.560
is happening inside that balloon
in your right hand, too?

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.890
Yeah! That’s right.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.020
Cool…

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.650
The balloon isn’t moving at all
even if he’s spinning that much Chakra…

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.100
There’s more power than
that time the rubber ball popped,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.100
and it’s spinning a lot more too!

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.940
Listen, in this third step,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.890
you’ve got to use 100% of
what you have learned…

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.690
and retain them.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.980
In other words, while keeping
the “Spin” and the “Power” at their max,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.890
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.890
and compressing the Chakra within it.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.850
Got it!

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.890
So, this training is about keeping

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.060
the spin and power that I did
in the second step,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.100
and conversely,
trying not to pop a delicate balloon!

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.770
Oh! That’s the most perceptive
you've been so far!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.100
Huh?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.690
But, what’s the point in going
to all the trouble?!

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.100
In short, it means this.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.890
Watch! It’s like this up until
the second step of the training.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.100
Next, after you have mastered
the third step!

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.650
This is what happens!

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.440
If you can keep this small typhoon
the size of your palm,

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.940
the force won’t disperse.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.600
The spinning gets faster and faster

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.690
and the power gets
more and more compressed.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.770
And the destructive power
will reach its max.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.150
Well, so, that’s that.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.650
All right! I’ll do this, too!

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.600
Okay, this feels right…

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.600
Now!

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.060
Retain it here!

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.890
Retain…

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.230
Retain…

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.060
No cutting-corners!

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.230
You’ve got to put out 100% spin and power,
and retain them.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.890
You gotta be kidding…

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.480
Unless I can perfectly control all my power,
it’s impossible!

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.400
Now I can see it…

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.770
This third step…

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.850
It’s on a totally different level
compared to the others.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.440
I told you…

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.890
With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,
it’s a super advanced Ninjutsu.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.020
Well, I’m done explaining!
We’ll continue as we go on walking.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.310
Hey, hey!

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.560
We don’t need to rush so much,
until I can properly…

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.440
We have already wasted enough time
waiting for your body to recover.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.890
There’s no guarantee that
Tsunade stays in this town much longer.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.600
What?!

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.900
But, but…

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.890
It’s not like an old acquaintance
is going to conveniently pop up

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.770
and start talking about
the good old times with her…

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.440
Come on, let’s go!

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.190
All right…

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.270
Long time no see…Orochimaru.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.650
I’d looked for you everywhere.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.150
What do you want from me
after so long a time?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.650
You aren’t thinking of talking
about the old days…?

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.650
Actually, I need to ask you
for a little favor…

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.770
His heartbeat is fast…

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.400
From that complexion,
he must have a high fever.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.520
He must have been fatigued
for quite some time…

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.650
And that arm…

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.770
Lady Tsunade.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.520
You must have understood by now.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.890
Go to someone else,
I don’t treat anyone any more.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.770
That won’t do…

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.440
You must know how serious
this wound is…

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.400
No one can treat this wound.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.440
Except for one of the Legendary “Sannin”

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.600
who won her fame as
a medical specialist, Princess Tsunade…

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.810
You…

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.890
That arm…
it’s not an ordinary wound.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.600
A special Sealing Jutsu or something…?

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.350
What have you done?

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.890
Well, it just happened…
when I killed the Third Hokage.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.890
You… Really?

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.150
Humph. Don’t look so scary.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.060
Anything that has a form
will one day decay…

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.520
Same goes for humans.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.890
You must already know that too.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:58.890
For you have let two of
your most beloved ones die…

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.060
Let two of the most beloved ones die?

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.560
I see… He thinks of terrible things.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:42.020
That was a really terrible way to die…

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.310
You!

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.890
Poisoned…

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.480
She’s fast!

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.650
Get out of my way!

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940
Won’t let you!

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.770
Calm down, Shizune!

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.440
This attendant…is an expert.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.850
Orochimaru…

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.810
Your personality's been like this
for a long time.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.520
And you know my personality
very well…

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.730
So stop fooling around with me.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.890
I’ll kill you, bastard!

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.480
She’s powerful…

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:23.850
And so scary…
she definitely must be single.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.520
Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered…

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.850
Hey Naruto,
there’s no time to be falling.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.480
If we don’t hurry,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.520
who knows where that shrew
will disappear again.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.730
Hey you, Pervy Sage!

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.560
That’s no way to speak to
a hard-working apprentice!

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.600
Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,
not you.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.600
Well, what the heck!

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.810
To have this Pervy Sage come
all the way to meet her…

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.440
Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.060
Hope she’s still here…

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.810
We didn’t come here to fight.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.350
We just want to negotiate with you!

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.900
Negotiate?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.190
Yes.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.650
Don’t make me laugh!

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.890
I’ve already told you once.
Get out of my sight!

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.060
We can’t do that.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:42.400
Get out of my sight.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.890
You are the only one
who can treat Lord Orochimaru’s arm.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.600
Get out of my sight.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.020
We’re not asking you to do it for free.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.650
Let’s make a deal!

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.730
I’ll count up to five.
Leave before I’m done.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.270
Or else, I’ll make you disappear myself.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.770
Please calm down.
lt won’t be a bad deal for you…

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.650
Five…

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.440
Four…

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.770
Three…

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.020
Two…

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.810
One…

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.770
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.400
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.730
Since we haven’t disappeared yet,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.190
I’m guessing that the deal is made?

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.900
Yes. I do know this young lady…

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.060
Really?

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:15.350
Yeah.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.890
To win back the money she lost here,
I think she said…

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.980
she was going over there.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.440
Spin… Power…

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.350
Letting them out to their max
and retain it…

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.310
Hey, kid.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:30.600
Hmm?

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.100
Wanna gamble a bit, too?

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.230
Over there? Where is that?

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.600
Hmm?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.690
See, if the total number of the pips
on these dices

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.230
comes out as even numbers,
that’s “Cho”

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.890
and if it’s odd, that’s “Han.”

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.520
Shut up! I am training right now,
don’t bug me!

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.150
What nonsense!
This is a gambling house.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.600
Instead of that balloon,
let’s play with these.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.890
No way! I don’t have any time
to be playing with those dice!

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.890
Ha, what a boring kid!

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.980
Shut up!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.520
So…can you tell me where that is?

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.690
Well, you can’t expect things to be free
in a gambling house, you know?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.940
Okay…

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.400
Let’s make a deal.
The information will be free if you win…

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.440
And if you lose,
I’ll give it to you for 1000 ryo.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.520
All right!

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.020
So choose, odd or even!

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.770
Okay! Here we go…

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.650
Well, so…
since I am exactly 50 years old.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:42.890
I’ll go for…even!

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.850
If it’s odd, I win…

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.770
I’ll open it now.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.230
Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!

00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.980
W-What the heck--?!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.890
1000 ryo…

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.890
Nice, Naruto!

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:10.270
Looks like I won…

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.890
Darn! It didn’t work again!

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.980
Retain…

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:26.890
Where shall I look next?

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.600
Geez, she’s nowhere to be found!

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.770
Hm? Me?

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.440
Lotto?

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.560
Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.890
Come and play with
this fun, fun Lotto.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.020
There’s one that you know
the result right away.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.020
Which one do you want?

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.890
Really, you are so much cuter
being chubby!

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.730
I can’t believe he won
with just one draw.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.900
He’s very talented in this…

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.650
though his talent in Jutsu
is still immature.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.890
Well…anyhow…

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.690
Where could have Tsunade gone?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.980
She couldn’t have gone that far
in this short amount of time.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.980
I guess we’ll have to
search for her from a higher place.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.890
If I remember it correctly,
this is a castle town.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.600
If we go up to the castle…

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.940
Naruto! This way!

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.150
Don’t you want to see those two…
Tsunade?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.890
Nawaki…Dan…

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:30.440
If I treat your arms,
what do you intend to do with them?

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.690
Well, I don’t like to lie…

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.890
So, I will tell you the truth.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.150
Hey, hey! Where is the castle?

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.600
It’s not there…?

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.520
In addition to getting what I want…

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.560
This time, I will completely destroy
the Leaf Village!

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.890
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.850
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:39.940
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.020
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.890
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:54.230
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:59.890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:04.900
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:19.150
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:24.560
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.310
Hey, enough already!

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.900
Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.730
Who cares if she is
the legendary Kunoichi?!

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.520
Who cares if she's
the medical specialist?!

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.560
There's no way I'll accept
this person as the new Hokage!

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.890
If she belittles the Third
and Fourth Hokages…

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.350
I don't care if she's the candidate
to be the Fifth Hokage!

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.890
I'll kick her butt!

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.250
Next time:
 "Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!"
