WEBVTT

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.820
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.570
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.360
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.690
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.700
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.150
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.610
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.110
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.570
All the kids said

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.570
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.780
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.450
All the kids said

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.280
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.900
All the kids said

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.360
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.530
All the kids took off

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.950
into this windless night

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.490
Because they want to change something

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.690
The Three Villains from
                    the Maximum Security Prison

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.690
All right!

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.690
I can start my training!

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.400
Right now, this is all I can do.
I can’t allow myself to fail!

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.400
What’s up?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.200
Going to all the trouble of coming
to pick me up like this…

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.610
You’re on your way to Kurenai Sensei’s
after this anyway, right…?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.690
Taking the time to converse
once in a while…

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.690
that’s also part of teamwork.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.690
Let me hear about your mission.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.860
It was pretty incredible…

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.700
But you wouldn’t understand
even if I explained it to you.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.360
I don’t want Akamaru to experience
that kind of thing ever again.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.690
And for that reason, I must polish
my Jutsu all the more…

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.860
I want to hear about it in detail.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.690
Because that’s what teamwork
is about.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.740
Are you sulking

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.490
‘cause you were the only one
who was passed up?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.700
You are sulking, aren’t you?

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.650
There have to be more further up…

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.200
Until I can see it…

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.610
I can’t believe you’re doing
that from the morning…

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.950
Neji, let’s take a break.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.780
Okay!

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.900
– Let’s go, Hinata! 					– Okay!

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.530
Father, see you later.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.200
Barbecued meat?
This early in the morning, huh?

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.650
Just when he was looking good
after losing some weight

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.320
when he was released
from the hospital.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.110
He made an amazing rebound,
didn’t he?

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.690
With that good an appetite,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.150
there aren’t any more worries
about his health, are there?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.570
When I’m done eating,
help me with my training, okay?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.860
Asuma Sensei!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.030
Hey, are you an idiot
or something?!

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.070
You’re recuperating, you know!

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.400
L-Lee… Come on,
let’s take a short break…

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.200
What’s the matter, Guy Sensei?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.650
The prime of one’s youth waits
for no one, you know.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.820
Maintaining the prime of one’s youth
is starting to get tough…

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.690
Thank you very much!

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.740
Do your best, guys…

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.950
I’ll master the Shuriken Jutsu by
the next time you’re here!

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.150
M-Me too…

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.690
I want to become a Kunoichi
just like you, Temari…

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.240
I’m honored.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.690
I apologize for asking you
to teach at the Academy…

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.990
since we’re so short-staffed right now.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.530
You probably would've preferred
to go sightseeing or something.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.530
No problem.
I’m doing this because I enjoy it.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.150
Yeah… And we were also able to survey

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.070
the future potential of
the Leaf’s military power…

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.690
Well, be careful going home.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.650
Okay…

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.070
If something happens again,
I’ll come to your rescue again.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.610
Just let me know, crybaby.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.780
You always say too much.
That’s why girls are…

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.400
Let’s kick butt again today, Akamaru!

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.650
All right, everybody’s here right?

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.320
You don’t need to be so tense, Hinata…

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.780
Y-Yeah…

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.740
All right! Everybody stand ready!

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.950
I can’t…lose to Naruto…!

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.320
All right! I’m ready!

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.700
I just have to wait
for Pervy Sage to come--!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.700
There he is!

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.780
But my training…

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.820
Don’t get so pouty, Naruto.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.530
Some work came in all of a sudden.
lt can’t be helped.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.490
It’s just gonna be doing
an interview

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.110
for some obscene magazine
anyway, right?

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.690
That kind of thing isn’t called work.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.200
It’s a mission to gather information
about the Akatsuki Organization.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.690
But if I tell this guy that,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.320
he might ask me to
let him come.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.360
Humph!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.950
I’ll make it up to you by…

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.070
Huh?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.030
W-What’s this?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.690
It’s so that you don’t get bored
while you’re staying at home,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.320
it’s a special training menu
I put together!

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.700
Wow!

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.450
Wait, wait!

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.530
My own prized secret training
methods are inscribed here.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.030
Don’t read this where
other people might see it!

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.070
Okay!

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.490
Well, do your best!

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.070
I’m gonna use this
to train vigorously!

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.530
Thank you, Pervy Sage!

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.070
The walls have ears…
paper doors have eyes…

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.490
Pervy Sage’s secret training methods…

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.320
WILLPOWER

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.700
What?!

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.900
Pervy Sage!

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.780
Since I have been entrusted

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.690
with the great Village Hidden
in the Leaves that you built,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.690
no matter what danger might strike,
it is my duty to protect it.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.280
The Hokage sure has it tough, huh.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:41.570
Yes, you really do.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.030
Is that you, Shizune?
Enter!

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.400
All of these reports regarding
the village’s internal affairs accumulated

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.690
because so many things
were happening in the Leaf Village.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.900
I guess the only thing to do
is start at the top.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.990
Leaf Maximum Security Facility.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.110
Did its name change?

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.650
Yes, in the past
it was called

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.400
Prison Specializing in
Capital Offenses Ninja.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.690
Fortunately, because there
is a downward trend

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.950
in felonies committed by Shinobi,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.900
along with the downsizing of the facility,
the name was changed as well.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.530
Incarcerated are murderers,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.360
those who were involved in
leaking classified secrets, and so on.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.030
They are all criminal Ninja…

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.360
There haven’t been any noticeable
disruptions in the past few years

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.690
and the facility has been
relatively stable.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.070
– Food! 					– Food!

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.860
It’s finally time to eat,
isn’t it, Elder Brother!

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.690
Yeah! I’m so excited!

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.690
Hey! Fujin! Raijin!

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.240
If you don’t shut up,
you’re gonna go without dinner!

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.820
Gimme a break! Those guys…

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.690
You may pass!

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.700
Hey! Wait!

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.690
You’re hurt, aren’t you?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.690
Go to the dispensary later
and have that looked at.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.030
Okay…

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:22.650
All right, next!

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.990
H-Hey, Elder Brother…

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.320
Huh?

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:46.280
Why is the little finger
short and weak?

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.690
That’s easy, Raijin.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.240
If the little finger was thick and strong,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.030
then your thumb would
have no leg to stand on.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.690
I-I see!

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.900
Elder Brother…Elder Brother…!

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.900
– Huh? 					– A lizard!

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.690
Raijin, you’ve always been
a dandy one from way back.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.690
W-We haven’t had enough to eat,
have we, Elder Brother?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.860
Yeah…

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.780
Not asking permission again…

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.030
What’s the matter?

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.400
What’s up this time?

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.690
I’m starving…

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.690
G-Give us something to eat!

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:43.200
Oh no… If these guys find out
I don’t have anything…!

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.700
Um…right now…

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.780
Don’t tell me that
you don’t have even one offering…

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.740
to these Fujin and
Raijin brothers?!

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.400
Well…wait…wait…!

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.650
What do you think? Tastes good, huh?

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.860
I’ll bring you something else later!

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.690
Right now make do with that!

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.950
– Okay! 					– Okay!

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.550
Are you okay?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.300
Those guys are quiet
when they have food.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.390
But if they get angry
they’re out of control.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:36.100
Yeah…They annihilated all their comrades
over food during a mission

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.800
and the people around just barely
managed to hold them down.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.590
Something smells good?!

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.590
Yeah.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.590
This way!

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.930
– Food! Food! Food!
– Food! Food! Food!

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.470
I just can’t get to liking clerical work.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:13.760
There’s still a whole lot more to do,
Lady Tsunade.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.850
I wonder what this is?

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.760
It looks like a formula
for some kind of medicine…

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:25.470
A formula…

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.180
Send an available Jonin here
immediately!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:32.850
Yes, ma’am?

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:34.260
Hurry!

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.470
Y-Yes, ma’am!

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.140
How about it…
Does it taste good?

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.590
I see…I see…
There’s still a whole lot more.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.390
Just as I thought,

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.390
that good smell was coming
from your place, Elder Brother!

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.930
Uh yeah…’Cause Elder Brother
always has delicious food!

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.930
It was worth sneaking, wasn’t it?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.590
’Cause I’d feel so sorry
if you guys had to go hungry.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:26.720
Elder Brother…

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:29.390
– A lizard! 					– A lizard!

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.600
I see, I see…Happy?

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.180
How about it, you guys?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.550
Don’t you want to eat things
that are even more delicious?

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.350
W-Where are they at?!

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.100
If we go to the place where
an old friend of mine is…

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.800
you can pig out on food
that’s even more delicious than here.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.590
Is that the guy you told us
about long time ago, Elder Brother?

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.140
Yeah, Lord Orochimaru…

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.800
Gimme a break…
that guy’s gotta be kidding!

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.300
That Pervy Sage…

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.890
just leaving me and
my training up in the air!

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.180
Come on, don’t say that, Naruto.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.760
Master Jiraiya had a mission too.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.600
Heh!

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.590
It’s probably that
Lady Tsunade decided

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.140
that only Master Jiraiya
could do the job…

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.590
It can't be helped.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.680
Damn! So it was Old Lady Tsunade’s
doing, after all, huh!

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:39.800
Well, I guess all I can do is treat you
to some ramen noodles like this.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.260
So cheer up.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.350
I’m gonna go complain
to Old Lady Tsunade!

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.350
Thanks for the meal, Iruka Sensei!

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.590
N-Naruto!

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.760
Damn… another annoying situation.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.590
Huh? The Maximum Security Facility?!

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.390
This is about a year ago,

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:27.590
a Chunin Academy staff member
used Naruto

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.850
to sneak out
the Scroll of Sealing.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.640
According to the report, it was
a crime committed by Mizuki acting alone.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.220
The crime was solved, but…?

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.470
Yeah, if it really was him acting alone.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:47.590
The possibility has arisen that
a bigger mastermind is behind this crime.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.220
This is a clue…

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.140
This is something that Mizuki
was concealing

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.930
when he was incarcerated
in the Maximum Security Facility.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:00.890
At the time, nobody thought of it
as anything more than a doodle.

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.600
Lady Tsunade, what is that anyway?

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.220
I don’t know, however…

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.590
The handwriting resembles
the document confiscated from the facility

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.590
where Orochimaru was conducting
human experiments…

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.590
Which means that…
Orochimaru is connected to this crime?!

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.800
The possibility of that is not zero.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.890
It’s not like a Chunin alone could do
anything with the Scroll of Sealing.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.300
It would only make sense if Orochimaru
were pulling strings from behind.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:36.930
Asuma! Kurenai!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.180
Go immediately to the Maximum
Security Facility and interrogate Mizuki!

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.890
Orochimaru?!

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.590
Be careful! Something’s strange here!

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.850
Yeah… It’s too quiet.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.390
Let’s go!

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:29.720
Oh, how touching.
A welome party for us…

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.590
Yeah…we’re giving you a big welcome.
Right, Elder Brother?

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.720
Yeah…

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.390
Asuma, don’t tell me that
those guys are…

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.140
Uh huh…The legendary idiot brothers…

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.590
Fujin and Raijin!

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.180
Asuma…

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.590
Hey, you guys are whooping it up
too much for a welcome party!

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.430
Hey, calm down…
the welcome party’s just started.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.180
His character has changed completely…

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.180
All you jerks…

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.640
You will…be our offering!

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.930
Do it!

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:46.590
Orochimaru!

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.180
Asuma Sensei… Kurenai Sensei!

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.720
Crappy news pass us by

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.300
And you become speechless

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.300
My voice is way too soft

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.590
So you don’t answer

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:51.220
You’re crying   Crying alone

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.050
What can I do?   I’m crying too

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.590
“Let my lonely scream ring out
through the night”

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:07.760
I’ll thrash this confused era
with my speed   Yeah

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:17.510
And I’ll thrash this confused night
with my speed   Yeah

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:26.590
I’ll thrash them with my piercing guitar
and my speed   Yeah

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:38.470
This sinking world and its evil bastards,
I’ll kick their butt   Yeah

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.850
What’s the matter, Ton Ton?

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.590
What in the world happened?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.390
Say, weren't you together
with Shizune?

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.180
Don't tell me something's
happened to her?

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.760
I don't know what happened,
but take me there, Ton Ton!

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.600
I'm getting a bad feeling about this!

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.300
Next episode,
“Ton Ton! I'm Counting on You!”
