WEBVTT

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.720
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.470
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.590
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.600
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.010
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.470
All the kids said

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.350
All the kids said

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.180
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800
All the kids said

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.100
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.430
All the kids took off

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.850
into this windless night

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.390
Because they want to change something

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.600
The Promise That Could Not Be Kept

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.100
Kakashi Sensei…

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.850
Where’s Sasuke?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.430
Kakashi!

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.010
How is Naruto Uzumaki’s condition?

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.680
He’s okay.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.930
What about Sasuke?
Where’s Sasuke Uchiha?!

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.550
How are the other Genin?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.300
Yes! By Lady Hokage’s order,

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.590
the first and second medical corps
have been dispatched…

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.050
The wounded from all areas have
already been gathered.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.890
They were convoyed after
administering emergency treatment.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.550
How are their conditions?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.390
Yes! Shikamaru Nara has minor injuries…

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
Kiba Inuzuka has serious injuries,
but it’s not life-threatening.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.590
Neji Hyuga and Choji Akimichi
are in serious condition…

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.510
At this point,
there’s no telling what will happen.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.180
Everyone…

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.590
The ingredients and
effects of the medicine

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.590
have been thoroughly researched.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.430
Excellent…

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.600
Now bring the deer antler!

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.590
Yes, ma’am!

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.720
How is he…Big Sister?

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.470
No walks for him for quite a while…

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.550
The muscles of his limbs
have been severely damaged.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.550
You’re a vet, right, Big Sister?
Can’t you somehow…?

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.590
It’ll be okay.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.300
It’ll take time. But there’s no threat
to his life, so rest easy.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.260
Walks for you are out of the question
for quite a while, too!

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.010
Yeah, I know…

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.800
Intensive Care Unit 7

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.590
It’ll soon be three hours…
Please take over.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.720
All right!

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.930
Although we’re making
this kid’s hair into a conductor,

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.260
please don’t mistake the cellular rate
of the deficient parts!

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.680
Right!

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.970
As for the Chakra control, handle it
as if we’re threading a needle!

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.350
Understood!

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.590
Intensive Care Unit 6

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.100
There’s no point in
you getting frustrated, right?

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.720
Missions come with sacrifice…

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.430
You took the mental training, right?

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.220
Training and actual battle
are different, you know…

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.430
I know what missions are about…

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.590
And I thought I knew what
the Shinobi world is like.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.260
I became a platoon leader
for the first time on this mission.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.350
With that, I understood…

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.590
I’m not cut out to be a Shinobi.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.180
Surprisingly fragile…for a man.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.140
This time…

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.300
The only thing I was able to do
as platoon leader…

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.970
was to believe in everyone.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.590
I was naïve…

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.010
I didn’t have enough power…

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.300
It’s all my fault!

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.590
Are you afraid of getting hurt?

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.140
Shikamaru…

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.010
Are you going to be argued down
by a girl and run away?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.590
It’s a drag…

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.550
I don’t want to have arguments.
I’m not a woman.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.180
Yeah… But you’re not a man, either.

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.010
You’re just a coward!

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.470
Even if you quit being Shinobi,
the missions will continue.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.390
Someone has to do it.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.550
Your comrades will just
be dispatched again…

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.640
under a different platoon leader.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.050
And your comrades might die there.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.760
But if at that time,
you were the platoon leader…

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.140
your comrades might be saved
from that happening to them.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.590
If you reflect on this time,
make use of the experience and learn,

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.220
you might be able to carry out missions
with more perfection.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.590
If you really think your comrades
are important to you,

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.180
before you think about running away…

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.350
think about becoming more exceptional
for the sake of your comrades!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.470
That’s what real comrades are,
you coward!

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.930
Intensive Care Unit 6

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.550
He’s okay, now!

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.260
The antidote has stopped
the death of cells

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.680
caused by the side effects of the Pills.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.760
You were a big help this time, Shikaku!

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.180
The Nara Clan’s secret medicinal
preparation manual was very useful.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.800
It must’ve been tough to
make something like that…

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.800
It’s the result of day-to-day study.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.390
Thanks…

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.800
Lady Tsunade!

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.550
Neji Hyuga…
His safety line has been secured.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.720
And, there’s some information…

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.590
Kakashi Hatake and Naruto Uzumaki
have just now returned.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.390
Although seriously injured,
it seems it’s not life-threatening.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.100
Two, huh?

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.550
Shikamaru…
lt seems the mission is a failure.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.510
But, everyone is alive!
That’s the most important thing.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.510
Next time for sure…

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.590
I’ll carry out the mission perfectly!

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.590
Sasuke…You’re the chosen one.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.760
Whatever… Just give me “power.”

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.590
Even though the form is different,
it’s still Lord Orochimaru before your eyes.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.390
If you don’t want to die,
use more care in how you talk.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.140
Wh-What? This quality of Chakra…

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.140
Yes… My future is inside this kid…

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.180
Hidden Leaf Hospital

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.390
I’m going to where Orochimaru is!

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:39.510
Please…bring back Sasuke!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.680
I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!
I promise that on my life!

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.590
Oh…You were awake, huh?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.260
Shikamaru!

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.050
I’m going on ahead to Choji!
What about you?

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.180
I’m going on ahead to…
Naruto and Sasuke!

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.600
I see… So everyone’s okay.
That’s good.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.100
Then, Sasuke…

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.590
Yeah…he's gone.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.850
Intensive Care Unit 6

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.470
Then, I still can’t see him…?

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.220
Yeah… But Lady Tsunade said that
he should regain consciousness soon.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.590
Thank goodness…

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.260
It’s really a great help that

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.850
Lady Tsunade returned
to the Leaf Village.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.430
If she hadn’t, right about now,
Choji would be…

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.970
The Lady Fifth…Hokage.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.180
You’ve come to visit?

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.470
Information sure travels fast.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.550
Sakura…

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.720
Naruto…

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.680
I heard you suffered
quite a serious injury…

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.300
But you look well, considering.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.590
I’m sorry… Sakura…

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.140
Why do you apologize?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.010
Being you, you probably
got reckless again, right?!

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.050
Jeez, you look like a mummy…

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.760
I’m sorry… I…

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.180
Hey… The weather’s nice today.
So open the curtains.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.850
Sakura! I…

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.510
I’ll keep my promise, no matter what!

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.800
I promised on my life.
That’s what I said, so I…!

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.100
It’s okay already, Naruto…

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.800
Sakura! He…

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.590
I always…

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.600
said that, so… I…

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.430
I stick straight to what I say!

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.260
That’s my Way of Ninja!

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.590
Naruto…

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.720
Thanks, Naruto…

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.300
I’ll get right to healing this injury
and I’ve got to bring Sasuke back!

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.430
Wh-What was that?!

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.100
Per…Pervy Sage?!

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.550
Yo!

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:53.390
I’ve come today to tell you
something important.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.180
From here on,
as my official disciple,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.260
I’ll train you to become
a full-fledged Shinobi in three years.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.050
Three years…?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.600
I’ve received some credible information
from a certain source

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.010
concerning the “Akatsuki.”

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.600
Akatsuki…

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.720
It seems that it will be
three or four years

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.590
before they come after you next.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.720
I don’t care about that!

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.930
Talking about stuff that’s
so far down the road…

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.050
I don’t have the time
to be doing slowpoke training!

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.350
What do you mean?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.510
If I don’t go after
Sasuke immediately,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.430
he might be killed by Orochimaru!

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:40.850
“Immortal” doesn’t mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.800
Before his body decays,

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.350
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.430
It seems you’ve learned
of the true purpose

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.590
for Orochimaru seeking Sasuke…

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.590
Huh?! Then that means you also knew…?

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:06.050
I was looking into
Orochimaru’s Immortality Jutsu.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.890
It seems with that Jutsu,

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:13.590
he can’t reincarnate into
the next body for three years.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.260
And unable to wait for Sasuke,
he just recently reincarnated…

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.970
It’ll be okay for three years from now…
There is time.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.930
That’s not a lie, is it?!

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.180
Not a lie, is it?!

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.470
Nope…

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.850
However…

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.850
Forget about Sasuke…

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.180
Sasuke went to Orochimaru
on his own accord.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.390
No matter what you do,
he won’t change.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.720
I’ve seen many Shinobi, so I know…

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.300
Sasuke is the same kind
as Orochimaru.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.590
If you’re thinking about bringing him back,
just forget it.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.850
That’s something an arrogant fool
would do!

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:17.680
He may be nothing to you
but he’s my friend!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.590
Would a friend hurt his comrade?!

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.720
Take a look at your current plight!

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.100
This is…!

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.590
Why? Why would you…?

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.760
We were called Sannin together…

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.890
Weren’t we comrades
since we were kids?!

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.970
In every regard,
you’re a foolish guy, Jiraiya…

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.220
You lack thought
in everything you do.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.390
That’s why you didn’t notice
what I was doing.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.600
Can’t you rethink it, Orochimaru?

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.590
Absurd!

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.430
How can you be so stupid?!

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.720
No matter how much I wanted it…

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.180
in the end, there was no way
he would come back.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:17.550
After the agony, all that’s left was
my own powerlessness and regret.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.590
I don’t want you to go through
the same thing…

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.180
If you’re going to go after Sasuke,
then there’ll be no training.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.800
I’ll get Anbu Black Ops to watch you

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.890
and depending on the case,
prohibit you from leaving the village.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.300
You’re not just an ordinary kid…

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.430
You possess the Nine Tail Fox
that the Akatsuki is after!

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.220
This is serious.
I'll just have to do that…

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.930
if you’re going to act on your own
without listening to what I say.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.300
Eventually, you’re going to have to deal

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.470
with guys more troublesome
than Orochimaru.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:01.720
Give up on Sasuke.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.640
Sooner or later this was
going to happen.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.590
Don’t suffer anymore!
Forget and dismiss him.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.010
It’s not just Jutsu or power…

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.100
If you’re a Shinobi, develop eyes that
can make the right judgment.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.590
And if you’re going to live
as a Shinobi, become wise.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.850
If you remain a fool…

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.550
the reality is that it will be tough
living in this world.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.050
Fine.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.260
If that’s what being wise is…

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.590
Then I’m fine being a fool for life!

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.590
Even if by myself,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.590
I’ll create even more awesome Jutsu
and save Sasuke no matter what!

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.260
And, and,
I’ll even kick the Akatsuki’s butt!

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.590
If someone like you
were to do it alone…

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.430
the best you’d be able
to come up with

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.470
would be some
stupid erotic Jutsu, anyway.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.890
It might somehow work out

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.720
if you are a big fool and
not an ordinary fool…

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.010
Be prepared once
you’re out of the hospital,

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.890
you big fool.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.050
See you then.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:30.590
Roger!

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.100
– It’s been seven years since…
– …all the members gathered like this.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.050
Since Orochimaru left
the organization.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.050
That Orochimaru has gotten
the Sharingan.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.010
Itachi…Your little brother?

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.590
Don’t get hasty. Yeah.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.470
We’ll kill Orochimaru eventually…

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.890
More importantly,
there are only three years left.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.680
Can everyone accomplish
the work required of them?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.760
Huh?

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.300
Yes, our goal is…

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.680
to get everything,
including the Nine Tail Fox in question!

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.010
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:35.470
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:45.930
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:55.640
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:02.590
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:11.760
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:23.590
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:33.930
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.600
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.800
Sakura’s been weird all along
ever since Sasuke left.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.640
I can’t put it well,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.590
but she’s gloomy or fretting
or something.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.180
On top of that she says,
“This time I’ll do my best on my own.”

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.470
What the heck does that mean?

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.850
It’s bugging me, it’s bugging me!

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.220
This isn’t the time for me
to be relaxing in the hospital!

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:17.220
