WEBVTT

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.930
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.200
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.610
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.580
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.250
For no single one,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.920
To none does belong,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.190
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.000
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.500
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.800
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.270
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.820
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.350
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.960
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.070
Rockin' my heart

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.820
Die.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.690
Darn!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.590
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.560
Hmm... Shadow Clone Jutsu.
And there are quite a few of them.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.420
Here I go!

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.640
It's impossible, after all...

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.580
There is no way that
you can beat a guy!

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.820
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.520
Sasuke!

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.830
I see!

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.660
So that's your plan, Naruto!

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.500
That's pretty good for you!

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.080
Demon Wind Shuriken,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.620
Windmill of Shadows...

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.690
A Shuriken won't work on me.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.810
I see.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.510
This time it's aiming for my real body…

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.650
But...

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.820
It's not so easy!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.920
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow!

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.020
This is...

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.130
The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.830
A second Shuriken in his blind spot!

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.370
But...

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.810
Still too naïve.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.310
He dodged it!

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.830
Here it is!

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.900
Kakashi: Sharingan Warrior!

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.230
You little brat!

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.510
Kakashi Sensei!

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.490
Naruto...

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.120
Your strategy was outstanding.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.830
You've grown up…
Both of you.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.830
The purpose of the Shadow Clones
was not to take down Zabuza,

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.770
but to hide my transformation
into Demon Wind Shuriken!

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.820
I left one clone behind, then
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.810
Then a clone threw the real me, who had
transformed into Demon Wind Shuriken,

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.810
towards Sasuke!

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.780
Sasuke!

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.480
When Sasuke got me,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.420
he must have realized
right away who I was.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.820
Then he took out his own Shuriken...

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820
And that's the Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.730
Demon Wind Shuriken…

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.430
Windmill of Shadows!

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.570
Hidden in the shadow of the real Shuriken,
I aimed for Zabuza.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.910
Of course I didn't think
 I would defeat Zabuza!

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.810
But I thought I'd destroy
the Water Prison.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.420
And as a bonus
I defeated his water clone, too…

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.820
It was a huge success!

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.120
That was a fluke…

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.660
It was a fluke, huh!

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.690
Still, they performed oustandingly
in tandem…

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.030
in this desperate situation.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.760
Despite the fact…

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.830
that those two always
fight like cats and dogs.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.670
Hmph…

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.800
I got distracted and
broke my Water Prison Jutsu…

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.240
That's not it!

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.610
You didn't break the Jutsu…

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.040
They forced you to break it.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.790
I'll tell you now,
the same Jutsu won't work on me twice.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.160
So what will you do?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.340
Sakura! 					Stay alert.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.810
Sharingan!

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.910
Ushi, saru, u.
Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.380
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
lnu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.820
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne...

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.820
Ushi, saru, u.
Ne, inoshishi, tori, ushi.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.890
Uma, tori, ne, tora.
lnu, tora, mi, ushi, hitsuji.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.790
Mi, inoshishi, hitsuji ne.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.000
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi , uma, hitsuji.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.570
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.800
– Ne, ushi, saru, tori. Jin, ne, inoshishi.
– Jin, saru, tori, tatsu. Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.270
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.540
Ne, ushi, saru, tori.
Jin, ne, inoshishi.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:25.280
Tori!

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:31.750
Water Style!
Water Dragon Jutsu!

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.320
He copied that chant
in seconds...

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.020
and so perfectly…!

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.660
W-What is this?

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.720
Is it Ninjutsu!

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:31.910
Strange…

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.780
What is going on…?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.620
Jin, saru, tori, tatsu.
Tori, ushi, uma, hitsuji.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.480
Tora, mi, ne, saru.
U, inoshishi, tatsu, hitsuji.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.690
The Sharingan is the ability to memorize
 and copy the enemy's Jutsu...

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.460
But...

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.920
Tori!

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.830
Water Style!
Water Dragon Jutsu!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.530
The Jutsu was set in motion
at the same time!

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.800
By any chance, is this guy…

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.530
This guy…!

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.490
The same identical movement!

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.420
Furthermore, at exactly
the same time!

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.890
What's going on, Sasuke!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.600
This guy…

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.070
My movements…!

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.810
He's perfectly…

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.640
Reading them.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.210
What?

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.920
He's reading my mind?!

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.820
Blast him! He's...

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.830
giving me
that barren, evil eye… right?

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.830
Hah! You're just copying…
You're a pale imitation.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.800
– You won't be able to beat me!
– You won't be able to beat me!

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800
– You! 					– You!

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.910
I'll shut that copycat
monkey-mouth permamently!

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.020
W-What's that!

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.720
Me?

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.330
R-Ridiculous!

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.260
Is that his Genjutsu (Illusion Jutsu)?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.800
Water Style!
Giant Vortex Jutsu!

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.810
W-Wha--!

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.420
No way!

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.330
I was just about to
set forth that Jutsu...

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.400
I can't keep up with…

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.870
his Jutsu!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.820
It's over…

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.270
Why...?

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.910
Are you able to see into the future…?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:03.810
Yeah…

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.820
You're going to die!

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.710
You were right. He died.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.390
He's definitely dead.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:28.830
I thank you.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.940
I have been waiting for the chance
to kill Zabuza.

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.040
By the looks of that mask...

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.310
You're a Tracker Ninja from
the Village Hidden in the Mist.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.820
Impressive. You're very knowledgeable.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.290
Tracker Ninja?

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.420
You don't know what
a Tracker Ninja is?

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.830
We learned it at
the Academy, didn't we?

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.830
Tracker Ninja pursue…

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.500
guys like Zabuza who turn against
the village where they were born and raised.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.040
And when they break away from
the village,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.200
Tracker Ninja go after these Rogue Ninja
and assassinate them….

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.110
in order to avoid having
the secrets of the village being leaked.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:12.810
That's common knowledge!

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.480
You should study more!

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.280
That's right.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.950
I'm a member of Hidden Mist Village's
Tracking Unit

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.490
whose mission is to
hunt Rogue Ninja.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:28.360
From his height and voice,
he's not all that different from Naruto…

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.830
A Tracker Ninja… ?

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.410
He's not just an ordinary kid…

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.900
What are you?!

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.280
Hey you!

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:25.750
Don't worry, Naruto.
He's not an enemy.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.820
That's not what I'm asking!

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:29.990
I…!

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.960
I mean...!

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.490
That Zabuza…
That Zabuza was killed!

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.830
That guy who was so strong…

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.900
He was killed so easily... by a kid
who's no different from me!

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.530
We're…

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.740
We're pathetic!

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.470
I can't accept that!

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.240
Well!

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.610
I understand your disbelief.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.880
But… this, too, is reality.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.660
In this world, there are kids
who are younger than you…

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.590
and stronger than me.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.450
Your battle is over for now.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.220
I must get rid of this corpse…

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.830
because it contains many secrets.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.230
Now then, please excuse me.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.400
He's disappeared!

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.480
He's not here anymore.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.320
What was all this for?!

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.030
What are we anyway?!

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:19.830
Naruto…

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.340
Darn it! Darn it! Darn it!
DARN it!

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.610
Things like this happen
when you're a Ninja.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.910
If you're frustrated,
apply it next time!

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.850
Our mission hasn't ended yet.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.820
We must take Mr.Tazuna home.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.400
So sorry, everyone!

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.570
You can rest at my house!

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.900
Okay!

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.600
Let's perk up and go!

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.750
W-What!

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.850
What happened!

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.820
Kakashi Sensei!

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.830
Kakashi Sensei!

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.270
What'll we do?!

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.740
Kakashi Sensei has collapsed!

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.240
Gato's henchmen are probably
gonna come and attack us again!

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.810
Guess it means we've gotta
fight by ourselves.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.480
Who knows if this training will
make us stronger but,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.080
it's getting interesting!

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.820
I'll definitely get stronger.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.820
Next time:
 "The Forest of Chakra."

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.790
I'm going to kick butt once again!
