WEBVTT

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.560
C'mon!

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.560
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.670
Being chased by something

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.110
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.780
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.550
For no single one,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.480
To none does belong,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.320
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.890
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.000
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.170
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.340
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.770
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.350
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.850
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.560
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.730
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.570
Rockin' my heart

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.530
Darn it!

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.000
Where'd he attack from?!
ls it the clones?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.400
Where's the real body?!

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.440
It's useless for you to even attempt
following with your eyes.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.010
I absolutely will not be caught.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.880
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.680
Don't!

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.530
This is a teleportation Jutsu that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.560
uses mirrors that can
reflect only my image.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.630
Watching you from the speed I move,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.470
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all…

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.740
I knew it!

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.640
Is that Jutsu…
the Kekkei Genkai?!

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.340
Kekkei…Genkai…?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.550
It's the same type as
my Sharingan…

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.350
Then…!

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.420
That's right…

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.650
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu…

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.920
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.560
Darn it…

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.570
So… What?!

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.070
I can't die here yet.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.910
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality…

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.540
The dream to have my strength
recognized by everyone in the village…

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.980
and become the Hokage!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.550
Dream…

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.090
I, for the sake of my dream.
And you, for the sake of your dream.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.590
Please don't hold it against me.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.060
I want to protect someone
special to me…

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.900
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.670
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality…

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.540
That's my dream.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.310
For the sake of that dream
I will completely become a Shinobi,

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.850
and kill you guys!

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.930
Zero Visibility:
The Sharingan Shatters

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.730
Sasuke! Naruto!
Don't lose to a guy like that!

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.500
Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.540
What?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.640
Even if there was a chance that
we could break that technique,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.110
they won't be able to defeat that boy.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.320
W-What do you mean?

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.220
They don't have the mentality
to kill their feelings…

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.560
and kill another person!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.230
That boy really knows
the agony of being a Shinobi.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.470
He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.300
Exactly…

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.070
No real Shinobi will come out of
a peace-addicted village like yours.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.550
Because they are not able
to learn

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
the most important "experience of killing"!

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.020
Then…

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.050
Then…

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.460
What are we going to do, Sensei?!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.600
If I go over to
Naruto and Sasuke,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.930
Tazuna will be in danger.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.330
Even if I try the Shadow Clones.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.510
He'll come to stop me with
his Water Clones.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.380
I'll just be wasting Chakra.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.550
Then...

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.550
I'm sorry but...

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.720
I'm going to have to finish
this in an instant.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.190
Sharingan?!

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.730
The Sharingan again?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.260
Such an unimaginative guy!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.250
Sensei!

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.320
You might call me "an unimaginative guy,"

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.130
but you are afraid of the Sharingan,
after all... Zabuza!

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.270
The secret technique of a Shinobi…

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.740
isn't something that you show
your opponent so many times.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.540
Be appreciative.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.680
You're the only who has had
the chance to see it twice…

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.550
And there will be no third time…

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.890
Even if you were able to defeat me,
you can't defeat Haku…

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.090
What…?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.400
Kakashi Sensei can't win?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.560
That boy in the mask is that strong?

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.540
Since he was a kid, I have been
painstakingly teaching him

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.800
the battle techniques of the Ninja!

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.360
All of my techniques.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.100
On top of that…

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.100
he has been polishing up
his own skills as well!

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.910
As a result...

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.640
He has...

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.750
no matter how unbelievably difficult
his predicament,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.520
been extremely successful.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.760
He has no "heart" and has
abandoned the notion of "life."

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.560
He is a fighting machine
known as a Shinobi.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.570
Not only that,
his Jutsu surpasses mine!

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.670
The terrifying ability of
the Kekkei Genkai.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.270
In other words,
I have acquired a sophisticated tool.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.550
Unlike the scrap you're
carrying around.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.480
I'm not one to be afraid just
because I failed once!

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.550
I'll do it as many times as it takes!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.420
The Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:30.550
Stop!

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.160
W-What the hell is it…?!

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.960
I-It was just slight but…

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.210
I could see the trails of his movements…

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.470
One more try!

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.140
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.230
Don't you understand that it's useless?

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.640
Just because I see the trail,

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.110
doesn't mean that I can keep up
with his speed.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.590
The water…
is being repelled.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.690
But, what if that wasn't water…?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.000
All right…

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.300
The next one is going
to be my one shot!

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Just because a bunch of scrap
got together

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.940
doesn't mean that
they can defeat Haku.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.540
He is….
He is the best tool!

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.150
There's nothing boring than
a stranger bragging…

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.620
It's about time…
I make my move.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.750
Now wait.
As long as we're talking…

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.560
Let me brag about another thing…

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.560
Hmm?

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.530
In the battle before,

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.900
I didn't just let you defeat me
like a fool.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.050
It's over…

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.690
Haku, who was hiding in the corner,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.960
was observing part of the battle.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.130
Haku is quite smart.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.960
With his ability to analyze,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.930
he is able to plan a counterattack
after observing a technique just once.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.610
I've been anxious to copy your line.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.750
"I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsu
won't work on me twice."

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.380
Was that it…?

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.320
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.080
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.750
This is...?!

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.430
What is this…?
This really thick fog?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.940
The visibility is close to zero...

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.500
Sensei…!

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.540
Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.310
That's right.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.550
I have to trust Sasuke,
Naruto and Kakashi Sensei right now…

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.350
And I should do what I can do!

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.420
Huh?

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.190
Oh! Sakura!

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.830
Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,
 don't move away from me!

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.260
Yeah… I soo know it!

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.540
I know… 					Zabuza…

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.300
I'll finish them off soon enough…

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.840
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.550
You just don't learn, do you?!

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.560
What? The Fire Style Jutsu!

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.300
It takes…too long!

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.510
This is good!

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.780
Bit by bit, I'm figuring out
the timing...

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.720
I know it's called Hidden Mist,
but the fog is way too thick…

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.360
Even Zabuza himself shouldn't
be able to see anything...

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.540
Good job on dodging it…

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.140
Just what I expect of Kakashi
of the Sharingan...

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.610
He's….

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:02.680
closing his eyes!

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.020
But…the next time you see me,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.350
that'll be the end of it all…

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.020
You overrate the Sharingan too much.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:12.920
What…?

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.800
You spoke as if you saw through
everything, but…

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.400
Why?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.940
Could it be possible that
you can see the future…?!

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.710
You are going to die.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.550
Your foresight was wrong, after all.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.550
Kakashi...

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.390
You can't read my mind or
my future...

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.860
The Sharingan is merely a diversion
that makes you believe that!

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.760
Those who have the Sharingan...

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.770
possess both
perceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes…

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.340
Using these two powers and
bringing out Jutsus one after the other..

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:09.680
you were just acting as if
you can read the future!

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.020
First with the perceptive eyes,
you copied my movement right away.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.820
And this is the Image
Replication Method.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.670
You first got me in
a ruffle with it…

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.940
Once you make sure that
I'm flustered,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.310
you nail the "heart's voice."

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.810
– This is the Mind Imitation Method.
– It's only an imitation, after all.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.380
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!
– You can't defeat me! You monkey!

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.390
That imitating monkey mouth...

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.550
I'll make sure that you won't be
able to open it any more!

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.660
And…

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.960
You judged the right timing when
my frustration was reaching its height

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.460
W-What is that?

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.600
You set a clever trap.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.260
Me...?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.970
You used the Genjutsu with
your hypnotic eye and

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.270
made me weave the signs first...

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.540
This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.110
The Giant Vortex Jutsu!

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.360
R-Ridiculous!

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.500
Then that makes it easier.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.170
First vanish into the thick fog,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.900
and make your
perceptive eyes useless….

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:40.140
Huh?

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.980
Darn! The guard is falling behind!

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.610
I will close my eyes as well!

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.180
I will shut off your ability to use
your hypnotic eye

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.850
in a close-distance battle.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.720
Why?

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.560
That also means that
you will lose your ability to see.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.090
Did you forget...?

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.800
That I am a genius in Silent Killing,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.800
a technique to find
the target just by sound.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.750
He read my movement...
No way could he do that.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.650
Darn! We were so close!

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.390
Naruto, can you still move?

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.660
Of course! I'm totally fine!

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.560
He's pretty much spent…
and it's no wonder.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.700
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.570
But thanks to him,
I found our way out.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.930
I found the way to break through!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.400
Hah!  Impossible!

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.580
That was just a coincidence.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.680
Naruto! Run!

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:58.550
What?

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.150
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.920
A-All right!

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.420
You won't be able to...!

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.340
I-I'm not going to lose!

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.480
There!

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.540
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.970
Darn!

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.540
T-That was good just now!

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.540
What?

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.980
We're doing it one more time!

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.550
All right!

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.150
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.220
To prove that,
he's little by little…

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.600
This won't go as you've planned.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:24.500
First, I'll get you!

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:31.540
Sasuke!

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:45.190
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.390
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:59.440
Be calm… Think...
What will he come after?

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.640
Oh no!

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.260
What?!

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:19.660
Too late!

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.530
Why? Why is it?

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.540
Why did this happen?

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:21.610
I never asked for your help!
I hated you!

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.550
But you…

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.550
Darn! I won't forgive you!

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.760
