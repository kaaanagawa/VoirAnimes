WEBVTT

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.560
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.060
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.690
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.270
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.690
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.690
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.350
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.190
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.480
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.850
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.150
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.730
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.310
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.810
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.440
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.020
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.730
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.150
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.520
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.890
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.520
even though I can't
use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.890
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.150
All right!

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.150
I’m going to do my best again today!

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.810
Oh! Bushy Brow!

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.480
Oh… Good morning, Naruto.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.310
Hey, hey, did you already get checked out
by Old Lady Tsunade?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.400
How was it, how was it?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.980
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.690
so we must do our best!

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.020
You’re right.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.400
Bushy Brow, you should get better
as soon as possible

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.650
and succeed in your mis--!

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.350
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.400
What’s the matter?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.440
It’s Konohamaru!

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.730
Huh? What’s wrong with Konohamaru?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.890
He’s in trouble.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.400
In trouble?!

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.230
The Will of Fire Still Burns

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.650
At this rate,
we will have to open it by force.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.980
Try it! Who do you think I am?!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.520
I am the grandson of
the Third Hokage!

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.650
If you go against me, then…

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.440
It means you’re going
against the Hokage!

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.650
We need Lady Tsunade
to assume her position immediately.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.770
Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.020
You'll get something even more terrible
if you come close to me.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.100
Honorable grandson! Even for you…

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.890
There are things that can
and cannot be forgiven!

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.890
Shut up!

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.230
What is all this commotion
so early in the morning?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.440
It’s hurting my head.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.480
Lady Tsunade…

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.980
It's just one kid…
What're you doing?

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.980
Yes…

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.350
Get rid of him!

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.890
But it’s the grandson
of the Third Hokage!

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.650
It doesn’t matter if
he’s the grandson or the great grandson.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.890
I am the granddaughter
of the First Hokage!

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.810
He might just open his eyes
if he gets roughed up a little.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.980
Now move it!

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.940
– Yes! 					– Yes!

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.850
Wait!

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.890
Naruto?!

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.890
Hey, hold on there.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.770
I don’t really know
what's going on,

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.890
but don’t be so rough with Konohamaru,
Old Lady Tsunade.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.270
An acquaintance of yours?

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.940
Yes, yes…

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.190
I’ll do the convincing,
leave it to me.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.690
Then, do something
by the end of the day!

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.480
Oh, Lady Tsunade… Please wait!

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.730
Excuse me.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.730
Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has already
been discharged from the hospital.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.730
I’m actually here to see Lee today.
ls he in the rehabilitation room?

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.770
Not yet.
That’s not like him to be late.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.900
I see.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.150
The probability of a successful surgery
is 50%, at best.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.310
And if it fails, you'll die!

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.770
Hey, Konohamaru.
What are you doing in there?!

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.190
Hurry up and come out.
Then let’s go eat some ramen.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.890
Don’t worry. It’s on me!

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.890
You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.150
All right! You can have eggs too!
How about that!

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.400
At least answer me!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.810
Shut up, you fool!

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.980
You called me a fool!

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.480
Open up already! I’ll break in! Hey!

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.730
Try if you can!

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.650
W-Why you--!

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.810
– Naruto… 					– Naruto!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.940
Oh, Lee… You’re here.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.400
S-Sakura!

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.480
I wanted to bring you this.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:37.980
F-For… me?

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.890
Th-Thank you very much!

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.650
I-I’m sorry, Sakura.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:46.810
No worries.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.850
Sasuke is now recuperating at home.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.560
Thanks to Lady Tsunade.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.890
At this rate,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.900
seems like he’ll be able
to get back to his duties very soon.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.150
I see. That’s very good.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.190
Lady Tsunade is great, after all.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.060
I think if you had her take a look,
you’d get better very quickly.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:14.890
Yes…

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.600
But if there is something
that I can do,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.020
please feel free to tell me.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.850
Thank you very much, Sakura.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.810
Then I’ll see you soon.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.900
I would think that at least
one bar would be open.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.440
There’s no way.
What time do you think it is right now?

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.480
I can’t drink sake, and I can’t gamble.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.600
This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,
is no fun at all.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.020
Just like the Third Hokage.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.270
Lady Tsunade!

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.890
Oh, I’m tired.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.270
I just want to sit down and
have a drink somewhere.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.190
I understand.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.560
I will take you to a place where
you can sit and have a drink.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.730
What?

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.890
But I will have you do your work!

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.060
Here now, go ahead. It’s hot.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.890
Shizune…you’ve suddenly
become very strict!

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.900
I haven’t gotten strict.
lt’s probably that you were not aware.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.770
Not aware?!

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.810
“If I can’t get in the room,
then I don’t have to work.”

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.850
Isn’t that what you were thinking?

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.900
And that’s why
you left it up to Naruto.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.480
Humph! Could be…

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.980
This is the most recent list
of Ninja.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.060
The names and lineups of
the groups have changed a lot.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.600
So please look through them.
And I mean, look through all of it!

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.480
Oh bother.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.690
They have sweet rice cakes, too.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.440
I don’t like sweet things!

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.810
Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.810
At least tell me why you’re doing this!

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.900
Konohamaru!

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:33.810
Darn!

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.850
Everybody came here because
they’re worried about you!

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.690
If you don’t come out,
I’m going to drag you out of there!

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.310
Naruto Sacred Technique...

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.890
Sexy Jutsu!

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.650
Konohamaru, come out!

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:56.190
Konohamaru, hurry!

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:07.900
Hey! Say something at least!
This is so embarrassing!

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.850
Don’t fool around with me!

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.850
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.980
– Stop it already, Konohamaru!
– Stop it already, Konohamaru!

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.810
One, two…

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.520
– Uh, what is this?
– What the--?!

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.020
What's going on?!

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.020
Are you okay? Naruto?

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.650
This is the Old Man’s room.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.060
Eight D-rank missions,
three C-rank missions…

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.350
I see, very much like the Kurenai team.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.900
We can easily figure out
what the Third Hokage was thinking.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.810
This is the same as
their parents’ team.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.400
I see.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.890
Oh, I see. This team has their own specialty
and is well-balanced.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.520
My shoulders are stiff.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.520
I’m going to go get
some fresh air outside.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.520
Success…

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:14.980
Success…

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.940
Naruto…

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.520
Uh… Darn!

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.900
If that’s how you’re going to be,
then I’m not going to go easy on you.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.890
This is the Old Man’s room!

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.900
I won’t let anybody
use this room besides him!

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.890
The Old Man’s…?

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.900
That’s why, as his grandson,
I’m going to protect it!

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.600
Fool! This isn’t the time for that!

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.940
The Leaf Village is in great danger!

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.100
So what?! It doesn’t matter to me.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.890
Are you seriously saying that?!

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.850
Oh, now I’m mad!

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:08.440
And I can easily tear down one
or two doors with my new powers--!

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.890
– Naruto! 					– Naruto!

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.560
Old Lady Tsunade…

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.730
Oh! Watch out!

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.600
W-Wow…

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.230
Listen Konohamaru.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.850
The Hidden Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now!

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:36.060
Our forces have dropped to almost half,
and we have to finish our missions!

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.890
That’s what I taught you!

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.890
Yeah… um… well…

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.690
But if we don’t accomplish
our missions,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.890
that’s letting other countries know
that the village has been weakened.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.890
That’s what Iruka Sensei taught you!

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.100
Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.690
It’s not that!
lt’s not that at all.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.690
Then what is it?

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.940
Soon, nobody will call me
honorable grandson.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.850
Then I’ll just become
plain old Konohamaru.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.350
So what’s wrong with
plain old Konohamaru?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.150
No…

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.770
Why, why?! You hated
being called honorable grandson!

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.020
Everybody’s going to forget
about the Old Man.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:34.980
The Old Man.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.690
They’re going to forget what
a great Ninja he was,

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.980
they’re just going to put him away
like an old ashtray.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.650
The new Hokage will make all kinds
of changes in the Leaf Village.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.890
That’s not true!

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.730
The Hidden Leaf Village is
the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:54.230
And besides,
nobody will forget about the Old Man!

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.100
No! They will never forget about him!

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.230
They will forget, I guarantee it.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.890
They won’t forget!

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.850
That’s a lie!

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.190
It’s not a lie!
You can’t believe what I am saying?!

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.560
That’s right, I can't!

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.850
Oh boy!

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.850
Come with me, Konohamaru!

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.810
We just have to get Old Lady Tsunade
to promise

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:17.310
that she won’t change
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.480
And then on top of that,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.730
we can get everybody to promise us
that they won’t forget about the Old Man!

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:22.600
What?

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.890
Isn’t that what you want?

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.190
I can’t believe that I let
Lady Tsunade out of my sight!

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.890
Did you find her, Tonton?

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.810
Revitalizing the cells, I see.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.190
I’ve found you Lady Tsunade.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.100
What?

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.890
Lady Tsunade is studying?!

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.690
Be quiet! I can’t concentrate.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.730
Concentrate?!

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.770
I’ve never heard you use that word
except when you're gambling.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.890
Is that Shizune’s voice?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.890
Shizune…

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.890
Do you remember that Medical Ninja
by the name of Kabuto?

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.890
What about him?

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.810
His ability to create new cells.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.100
I was researching ways to use
that power on the patients.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.900
For Lee?

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:59.890
If the 50% chance becomes 51%,
it’s worth a try.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.150
It really depends on the individual’s traits.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.190
Even for you,
it might be hard to acquire those powers.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.520
I’ll just have to try.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.890
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.890
It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.900
I am the Third Hokage, after all.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.770
If you don’t like it,
you should just quit!

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.060
Everybody from the village
is my family.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:44.270
To protect the family,
that is the duty of a Hokage.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.650
Oh! Old Man!

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.900
Just for today,
I’m making a special exception.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.350
What’s the matter Konohamaru?

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.890
Don’t you want to see
Old Lady Tsunade?

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.900
No.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.890
I’ll just have to do it.
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.890
It can’t be helped, Konohamaru.
I am the Third Hokage, after all.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.480
It can’t be helped.
I am the honorable grandson, after all.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.810
Huh?

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.890
I am Konohamaru of
the Hidden Leaf Village, after all!

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.440
H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.810
What’s going on with him?
Hey Konohamaru!

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.060
Lady Tsunade?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.270
Nothing…

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.150
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.650
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.810
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:38.440
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.940
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.890
That hold us together

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:58.560
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.230
you say laughingly

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:07.100
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:12.020
Like a comet,

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:18.230
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:25.440
You bring light into my heart

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:35.890
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:44.730
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:48.810
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.600
Back then, Sensei taught me

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.480
that I would grow up to become
a great Ninja

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.690
through lots of effort and
competition with my rivals.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.810
His words put me at ease.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.400
A path opened up for me
just when I was unsure of myself.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.730
I realized that all I had to do
was try my best.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:11.150
But now…

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.770
Next time: "Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi"
