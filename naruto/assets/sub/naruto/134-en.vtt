00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.700
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.450
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.490
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.580
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.000
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.450
All the kids said

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.660
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.330
All the kids said

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.160
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.790
All the kids said

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.250
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.080
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.410
All the kids took off

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.830
into this windless night

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.370
Because they want to change something

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.450
The End of Tears

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.200
By special…

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.490
By special,
you meant that?!

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.490
I don’t feel like I’m gonna lose.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.000
Sasuke…you…

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.620
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.580
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.370
When they have entirely
eaten you…

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.290
you will lose yourself…forever.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.490
This body…

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.330
It looks like there’s no time to waste.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.580
I don’t have any feeling
in my left arm…

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.950
That power you have…

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.500
seems to involve
some risks too, huh?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.120
Did you know…?

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.490
That this place…

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.790
is called the Final Valley.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.490
I think this is the perfect stage,
don’t you think…Naruto?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.830
Oh yeah…

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.000
I said there’d be
no more talking, didn’t I?

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.410
Well, in that case,
how about we bring it to a close…?

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.540
This battle.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.200
All our battles up to now!

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.620
Next for Squad Seven.
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.160
Sakura Haruno!

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.200
Yipeee!

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.080
With Naruto…?

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.410
And Sasuke Uchiha.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.000
Yipeee!

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.120
With Sasuke…?

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.290
Try not to slow me down, loser.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.540
You…!

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.490
But…but…but…you told us…

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.200
That’s why they……

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.330
Aren’t we a three-man squad?

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.120
That’s right! We three are one!

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.410
Hey!

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.490
Are you hurt? 					Scaredy Cat?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.080
Hey…are you hurt?
Scaredy Cat?

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.080
You are one of the ones
I want to fight.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.870
Sasuke!

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.490
I want…to fight you, too.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.490
I don’t want to see
any more deaths

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.490
of my precious comrades.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.490
Summoning Jutsu!

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:07.490
I…will protect Sakura!

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.490
What’s so funny?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.660
Nothing’s funny, believe it!
I'm happy!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.490
When I think I can finally
beat you here!

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.290
What did you say?!
Don't talk foolish, you failure!

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.080
I’m not going to be
a failure forever!

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.040
Just bring it, now!

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.160
Put on your headband before that!
I’ll wait.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.490
I don’t need such a thing…

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.120
Just do it!

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.660
You wouldn’t even be able
to put one wound on my forehead!

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.200
You’re wrong!

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.490
I’m saying this is a testament

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.870
to fighting on equal terms
as a Leaf Shinobi!

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.490
Naruto!

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.620
Sasuke!

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.750
I’ll win no matter what!

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.870
Don’t flatter yourself!

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.540
Stop it!

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.790
And from this time onward…

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.660
Chidori!

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.200
Rasengan!

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.160
– Rasengan! 					– Chidori!

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.490
– Chidori! 					– Rasengan!

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.080
This Chakra…

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.490
This isn’t good!

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.330
Naruto…

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.450
I…

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.490
It’s started to rain!
Will it erase the scent?

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.490
No problem.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.870
We’re already close.
This way.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.910
Was I too late…?

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.870
Naruto!

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.870
Why did things come to this?!

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.200
This is Sasuke’s…

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.490
I didn’t make it in time…
please forgive me.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.830
Naruto…

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.330
I know the kind of person you are…

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.910
You must have made
a desperate effort.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.000
Sasuke…

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.040
That’s my boy…

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.910
With me, you’re all
your father talks about…

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.490
You are my one and only brother.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.490
I will continue to be for you…

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:23.290
a wall that you must find
a way to cross over.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.580
Even if you were to hate me…

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.000
You are someone

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.490
who can obtain Mangekyo Sharingan
just like me…

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.450
However, on one condition.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.000
Your closest friend…

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.910
The Final Valley…

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.620
To think that Sasuke and Naruto
would battle it out here…

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.490
How ironic…

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.290
Yeah…

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.160
When I look at
the flow of this water,

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:28.490
it’s as if I’m being confronted
by an eternal, never-ending battle…

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.910
Just like the fate of the two people
depicted in these statues here

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.120
who founded the Village Hidden
in the Leaves…

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:49.490
Naruto and Sasuke,
as long as you both live…

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.660
You have to kill…

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.290
your closest friend!

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.490
I'm not gonna…

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.490
abide by everything you say!

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.540
I will get my hands on power
doing it my own way!

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.790
I will surpass you
doing it my own way!

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.490
Without fail!

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.490
The rain’s…let up, hasn’t it?

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.870
Yeah.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.580
With that much rain,

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.830
I won’t be able to pursue
the scent anymore.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.370
Naruto is more important now
than pursuing Sasuke.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.290
Yeah.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.750
It’s gotten interesting, hasn’t it?

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.490
Yeah…

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:28.580
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:35.040
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:45.500
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:55.450
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.200
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:11.490
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:23.200
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:33.500
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.410
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.290
I’m sorry.
I’m really sorry, Sakura.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:00.250
I made a once-in-a-lifetime promise
that I would bring Sasuke back.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.120
But, I’m not finished yet!

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:06.250
I’ll fulfill my promise,
no matter what!

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.490
Since that was what
I was always saying…

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.250
that I won’t go back on my word.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.410
That’s my Way of Ninja!

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.490
