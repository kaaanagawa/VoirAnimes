WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.220
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.120
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.000
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.170
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.210
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.420
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.750
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.850
I’ll show you there are walls

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.560
which effort alone can
never break through.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.940
Sakura Blossoms!

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:29.560
Huh?!

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.870
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.440
But our Jutsu exceeds that
and is the speed of sound!

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.110
Lee!

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.320
My left ear...

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.390
There’s a little gimmick I have.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.230
Evading won’t work...
on my attacks.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.910
What is he going to do?!

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.980
It’s sound.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.610
Even though you evaded my fist,
sound assaulted you.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.520
Sound?

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.560
Do you know what sound is
all about in the first place?

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.760
Vibration?

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.200
Correct. In other words,
hearing sounds means,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.840
that the eardrum is
catching vibrating air.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.080
And the human eardrum breaks
with sounds over 150 Mhz.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.650
Also, by assaulting the semicircular canal
which is located even deeper,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.690
I can make you totally lose balance.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.000
You won’t be able to move your body
freely for sometime.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.540
Something old and tired
like Taijutsu don’t work on us.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.970
Well, you were doing good
up to a certain point,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.280
but I brought forth my Jutsu.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.880
It’s just not gonna work anymore.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.590
I freely manipulate ultrasonic waves
and air pressure,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.920
and have the power to
obliterate even boulders!

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.090
Primary Lotus!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.630
I can send air into the ground

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.600
and change the dirt into
a cushion as I please.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.900
It’s different from
your silly Jutsu.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.810
Blast it!

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.860
Lee, it is all right to use
this Jutsu

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.560
to protect someone precious.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.870
Protect... someone precious?

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.000
In any case,

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.340
I’m impressed that you
were able to master it, little man!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.550
You did it quite well, Lee!

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.180
Darn it!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.550
Okay, then!

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.550
Next is...

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.890
You!

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.090
Darn it!

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.120
He’s coming!

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.860
What?!

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.600
No way!

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.630
Lee!

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.500
Leaf...

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.340
Hurricane!

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.510
It looks like my earlier attack
is having an effect!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.540
I’m somewhat surprised...

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.550
but there’s not even a trace of
that flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.890
This arm amplifies sounds
from within to its maximum.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.260
It’s a speaker of sorts!

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.970
Lee!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.400
And the assault sound isn’t limited
by the direction of my arm...

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.340
it always converges on
the targeted prey by my Chakra!

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.640
Lee!

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.920
Now then... 					The final blow.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.520
I won’t let you!

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.030
Oh, well.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.560
Hey, let’s get outta here!

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.900
Those guys are pretty dangerous!

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.170
It looks like Sasuke and Naruto
are only unconscious, but...

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.970
even that guy Lee’s been
messed up and Sakura’s alone.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.010
What’re you gonna do, Ino?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.480
What do you mean?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.350
Well, Sakura’s in deep trouble!

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.850
You’re all right with that?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.020
Huh?!

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.460
You two were once close friends,
weren’t you?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.930
By the way...

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.470
What Sakura, don’t be so stiff!

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.380
Well...

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.810
Ino, I hear you also...

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.110
What is it?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.690
...like Sasuke.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.400
Then, that means from now on,

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.270
you and I are rivals.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.520
Why... why am I recalling things
from that time?

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.550
Hey, Ino!

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.990
What’re you gonna do?!

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.560
I know, but there’s nothing I can do!

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.560
I can’t heedlessly
go out there, can I?!

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.000
Even if I went out now...

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.640
I’d be taken down without a doubt.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.540
I also...

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:49.970
I also...!

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.020
Air pressure!
The shurikens got bounced back?!

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.560
Your hair’s shinier than mine.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.630
Hey! If you have time to worry
about your hair,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.070
you should practice!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.840
Getting all spiced up like a woman...

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:26.580
Why don’t you kill that Sasuke guy
right in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.650
Yeah! That sounds great!

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.550
Hey hey...

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.650
I won’t let you do such a thing!

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.250
Don’t move!

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.060
Sakura.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.560
My body... It has no strength.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.610
I...

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.550
Again... I’m just pulling everyone’s feet!

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.250
I’m always being protected.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.420
It's so frustrating!

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.260
This time for sure...
I had thought!

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.930
This time for sure...

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.530
I must protect people precious to me...
so I thought!

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.470
So...

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.540
Let’s do this!

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.400
Hey! Sasuke and Naruto are
gonna get it, too!

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.870
W-What should I do?!

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.110
That’s pointless!

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.180
That won’t work on me!

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.990
What are you saying?

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.190
Huh?

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.560
What?!

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.450
I always...

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.560
act as if I’m a full-fledged Ninja.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.460
I always say that I like Sasuke.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.400
I always act like I know everything
and lecture Naruto.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.540
I always just... watch them from behind.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.520
And yet...

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:20.980
Tazuna, get back!

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.630
Get back!

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.540
Now then...

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.540
Let’s get wild!

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.690
This is the only way to
take him down!

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.590
Sasuke!

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.510
Here it is!

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.540
Those two always covered
my back and fought for me.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.120
Lee, you say that you like me...

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.100
I’ll protect you until I die!

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.740
Primary Lotus!

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:48.940
With me at your back...

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.540
you risked your life and
fought for me.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.550
I have a feeling that you taught me...

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.550
Sakura!

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.350
Sakura!

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.520
Humph!

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.690
I want to be like all of you!

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.230
This time...

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.540
I want all of you...

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.310
to watch me...

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.940
...from behind!

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.550
Sakura?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.150
Sakura...

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.260
Kin! Kill her!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.560
Huh! That sign...

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.540
Substitution Jutsu!

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.670
On the right, huh?
You think I’m a fool?

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.940
With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.040
you think you can come at me?!

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.380
Kin, get out of the way!

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.320
Useless!

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.890
Air pressure 100 percent,
ultrasonic waves 0%, output...

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.090
Is that all you can do?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.760
Slicing Sound Wave!

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.400
You’re easy to spot...

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.400
You’re above!

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.070
I’ve said it two or three times that
that won’t work!

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.640
This is enough... for you!

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.040
Where next?

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.450
Huh?!

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.120
What...?!

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.550
This time... it’s not a substitution!

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.460
Get off me! Hey!

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.340
Sakura...

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.650
You’re always being called
“Billboard Brow” and being picked on.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.550
Who’re you?

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.360
I’m called Ino Yamanaka.
How ‘bout you?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.930
I’m... Sakura.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.740
Huh? I can’t hear you.
Say it louder.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.210
Sakura Haruno!

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.110
Huh, I see.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.650
You have a wide forehead.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.380
So, Billboard Brow, huh...?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.990
That’s why you hide
your forehead with your bangs.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.590
Like a ghost...

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.430
Sakura, was it?

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.570
Uh-huh...

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.140
Come back here tomorrow.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.910
I’ll give you something nice.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.210
Huh?

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.540
Darn, let go!

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.820
See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.220
I’ll give you that ribbon.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.760
T-Thanks.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:27.860
But...

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.560
But what?

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.560
My forehead...

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.300
You hide it, so people make
more fun of you, you know?!

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:41.840
You have a cute face Sakura,
so you should be more confident!

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.970
More confident!

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.180
Ino...

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.480
Hey, who’s that?
Who’s she, Ino?

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.090
Her name’s Sakura.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.550
Hey, say hello!

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:00.560
Hello...

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.560
Listen everybody! Listen!

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.500
There’s someone I like!
Who do you think it is?

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.970
Hurry up and tell us!

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.010
Don’t say it’s Sasuke?

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.480
Huh? Why’d you know?

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.210
What’re you talking about?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.680
Sasuke’s really popular,
he’s the most popular!

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.550
Huh? Is that so?

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.560
Oh no! I’ll have a lot of rivals.
What should I do?!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.300
Hey, Ino! Sakura’s been upbeat lately!

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.100
She’s just acting brave
and romping around!

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:53.180
Ino! I’ve heard Sasuke
likes girls with long hair.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:59.680
...likes girls with long hair.
...likes girls with long hair.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.250
Sakura...

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.260
I’ve heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.430
From now on, we’re rivals.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.530
Your hair. It’s grown quite a bit.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.300
Ino...

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.840
Why...

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.510
Why are you on the
same team as Sasuke?!

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.310
I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:37.590
Me too! I won’t lose to you, Sakura.
No matter what!

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.640
...Sakura!

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.210
I will...

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.750
I will...

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.460
Give it up!

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.570
It’s really bad...

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:25.900
Hey, Ino...!

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.680
I must... protect everyone!

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.550
You punk!

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.630
Huh?

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.760
Huh! More strange ones.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.570
Ino...?

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.640
Sakura! I promised
I wouldn’t lose to you, didn’t I?!

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.330
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:31.530
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:41.040
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:49.420
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.360
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.130
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.770
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:12.610
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:18.180
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:22.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.560
Just sing.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.800
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.130
The two are one

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:40.540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:46.110
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.550
Wow! This is Ino team’s battle?!

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.020
What a formation based on calculations!

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.150
I hate to admit it,
but they’re strong!

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.560
Even the Sound Village ones
would be no match for them!

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.730
We’ll protect Sasuke...

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.570
Huh?! What’s this feeling?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.600
Next episode: "Battle Formation:
lno-Shika-Cho!"

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.570
What in the world is going on?!
