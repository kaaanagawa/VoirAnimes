WEBVTT

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.880
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.790
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.090
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.250
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.420
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.960
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.840
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.880
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.130
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.800
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.790
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.340
Heh! It’s over…

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.090
Losing is not an Option

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.340
What?!

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.670
Just barely…

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.460
That was a close one.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.790
But…I was able to throw it off
just a little.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.170
There’s no mistake.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.250
He’s now realized the secret
of the Byakugan.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.420
What’s the meaning of this?
How?!

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.050
How was he able to throw it

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.130
a whole six inches
from his vital point?!

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.300
I see… That Chakra!

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.790
He was emitting Chakra
the whole time

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000
and covered the area surrounding him!

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.790
And in a wide range to that extent.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.630
No wonder he was able
to detect the arrow and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.790
throw off the trajectory of it.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.960
But constantly emitting that
much Chakra is a death throe…

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.790
If he doesn’t go that far,
he can’t dodge.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.090
In other words, there’s no mistake.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:29.920
It’s as I hypothesized…

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.670
The arrow earlier was
totally invisible to him!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.800
He doesn’t carry out useless attacks…

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.550
And from the results,
he accurately examines the information.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.550
And…he’s also discovered
the weakness of my eyes…

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.710
Impressive.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.210
Of all the enemies
I’ve fought until now,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.050
this guy’s the strongest!

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.090
He has 360-degree sight.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.800
And he unfailingly detects attacks

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.670
that penetrate the roughly
150-feeot circumference around him.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.130
But for some reason,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.000
there were Kunai Knives
he couldn’t evade completely.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.210
Why couldn’t he evade them?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.000
Because he couldn’t see them!

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.590
In other words, even his Visual Jutsu
has a slight blind spot!

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.800
Being unable to see Kunai Knives
entering that blind spot,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.210
he’s unable to react.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.630
So he was dealing with attacks
from the blind spot

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.790
with that defense technique.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.630
And I analyzed all the attacks
I carried out

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.550
and grasped them perfectly.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.920
Right behind his first thoracic vertebra…

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.550
there exists a blind spot expanding
from a very small point.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.590
Indeed, if he moves and
doesn’t stabilize the blind spot,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.340
it becomes difficult to aim there
with an arrow.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.840
But such a trick…doesn’t fool me!

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.750
Gentle Fist is pointless if
you don’t come close to your enemy.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.790
And you can’t afford to think about
approaching me at this point.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.000
It’s about how to escape now…

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.250
Though whether you struggle or not,
you’re going to die anyway.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.130
Heh… It seems you only
have a little Chakra left.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.550
The fate of the small fry character
in an easy game

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.500
is to be destroyed right away!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.550
It’s useless!

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.590
A thread?!

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.800
I see, with this thread…

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.840
This time, the trajectory was thrown off
slightly by the trees, huh?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.880
If that’s the case…

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.210
I’ll add some rotation this time.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.500
So even if it hits a tree,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.170
it’ll just cut through and the trajectory
won’t be thrown off.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.630
And as before…

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.840
I’ll control the arrow up until
150 feet away from him

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.790
using a thread with Chakra
flowing through.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.380
I’ll take aim at the moving target…

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.590
and plunge the arrow into
the blind spot with a pinpoint attack!

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.460
He’s still standing up?

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.960
He’s strong…
He’s much stronger than me.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.790
I hardly have any Chakra left now.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.550
I probably won’t be able to evade
his next attack completely.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.790
Is this it?

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.800
I’ll win no matter what!

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.790
Naruto… I wonder what you’d do.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.710
I’ve had enough.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.790
I can’t dodge it anyway.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.170
He’s stopped moving…
Has he given up?

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.630
But just to make doubly sure…

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.460
Maximum destructive power
with 120% accuracy.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.170
I’ve got him!

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.960
This is it.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.340
Gentle Fist!

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.790
Wh-What? He still…?!

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.000
No! My attack just now
should’ve made the kill.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.050
Substance with Chakra base…

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.300
It’s meaningless against Gentle Fist.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.790
Gentle Fist…

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.800
I see, in his final moments,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.420
he funneled the last Chakra
through the thread!

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.630
Eight crows…

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.170
Again I couldn’t see one of them.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.790
What happened to him?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.670
He damaged several of
my internal organs.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.380
But…I can still move.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.790
You failure…

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.790
I told you… I don’t know when to quit!

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.790
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.790
Because I was called…a failure!

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.790
But if you’re going to say it’s futile,
you don’t have to do anything!

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.790
After I become the Hokage,
I’ll change Hyuga!

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.630
The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.790
I was careless…

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.670
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu
I stunk at.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.300
Don’t be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.170
and how it can’t be changed!

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.340
Unlike me,

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.340
you're not a failure.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.920
Naruto…

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.170
Now it’s become the three of us…

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.800
Don’t worry about such things.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.590
Both Choji and Neji will
catch up right away.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.790
Choji had the trump card.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.790
And I’ve fought Neji
in the Chunin exam, so I know…

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:48.460
Know what?

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.790
That he’s…a true genius. Believe it!

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.250
I cannot lose…

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.380
Whether he’s an enemy
much stronger than me…

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.130
or even if this body should fail me…

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.500
I cannot lose!

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.630
I have a reason why I cannot lose!

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.790
I’ve had a hard time of it this time.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.300
I played too long…

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:35.880
Huh?

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.420
I can’t build up Chakra…

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.960
How? You should’ve
been instantly killed!

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.960
How come you’re alive?!

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.790
I couldn’t completely
evade it anyway.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.000
So I was prepared to deliberately
take the hit.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.210
And I knew of my own weakness
much more than you do…

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.170
There were eight crows, huh?

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:30.710
This Byakugan has a blind spot.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.790
However, if I knew that your attack
would only come from there…

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.790
I could release my Chakra just
to that blind spot and detect the attack.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.880
It’s not so difficult to make

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.550
a move of just a few inches
to throw off the aim.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.790
I’d suffer a serious injury,
but instant death can be avoided.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.250
So you took the hit deliberately…?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.710
It doesn’t change the fact
that you’re going to die here.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.670
How can you go that far?!

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.170
“Of all the enemies,”
you’re the strongest I’ve ever fought…

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.790
But, there’s a reason why I cannot lose.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:21.130
Of all those I’ve ever fought,
the strongest one said this to me…

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.550
– Unlike me…you are not a failure!
– Unlike me…you are not a failure!

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.920
He said that.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.380
I’ve been called a genius all along.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.710
So I cannot lose.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.790
And for the sake of those guys
who believe

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.790
that this humdrum and small me
is a genius!

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.790
“The fate of the small fry character
in a game is to be destroyed right away.”

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.710
You said that, didn’t you?

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.210
Look at this situation!

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.670
Things like fate,
isn’t determined by someone!

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.500
I wonder…

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.790
You also look like
you’re going to die!

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.790
Neji, live.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.460
More than anyone in the clan,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.000
you’re the man loved most
by the Hyuga ability…

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.800
I cannot die so easily.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.500
Even if you act tough,
you can’t stem the current now…

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.590
Master Sasuke ran to
the Sound Village by his own wish.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.170
Sasuke is now in the darkness…

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:20.790
No…

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.210
Naruto… You’ve got better eyes than me.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:35.670
There’s a person who can find him
in the darkness and save him.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.090
Master Sasuke belongs
to Lord Orochimaru.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.420
No matter who it may be,
they can’t save…

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.500
He can save him!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.630
Because…Naruto…you…

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.050
You saved me from the darkness!

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.050
Talking rubbish until the end…

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.460
But…

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.630
I haven’t been pushed this far
since Kimimaro.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.170
Damn it…

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.790
Everyone…

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.710
I'll leave the rest…

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.210
to you.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.790
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.790
And you smiled

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.420
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.170
In my own words

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:41.790
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.380
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.960
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:58.790
You listened without turning away

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.920
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:12.000
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:15.250
I feel so sad

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.210
But…

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.790
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.790
And you smiled

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.500
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.590
In my own words

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.960
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.210
And you smiled

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.790
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.790
In my own words

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:43.380
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.000
Yahoo! The enemies are quite close!

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.420
All right! We’ll catch up in a burst!

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.000
Speaking in terms of number,
we’ve got more!

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.790
If things go well,
we can get him back next!

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.710
Yeah! I don’t feel like losing
with four against two!

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:04.710
Four against two?

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.790
That’s twice the opponents’ number!

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.210
Say-say. Were there four of us?

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.000
Are you an idiot?!
Me, Akamaru, Shikamaru, and you!

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:12.920
No matter how you count,
there are four!

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.250
