WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:09.740
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.990
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.280
One more time

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.990
Are you really happy

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.240
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.940
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.780
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.940
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.940
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.990
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.940
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.940
One more time

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.940
Assassin of the Moonlit Night

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.570
T-This guy…

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.940
Sasuke!

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.940
So we were too late…

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.490
Those guys…

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.320
Sa…Sakura…?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.400
You guys…

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.700
T-This…

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.400
He probably fought recklessly…

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.280
like that time!

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.650
Sasuke!

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.900
Kakashi Sensei said there was nothing
to worry about with the bruise!

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.110
So tell me…Sakura…

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.240
Sakura!

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.990
What do you want?!

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.940
This guy… Who is he?!

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.400
His outward appearance
is different, but…

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.610
he’s that guy called Gaara.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.700
When I came into this world, I took the life
of the woman some might call my mother.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi…

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.280
my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.610
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.030
I was born a monster.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.110
So that's what he was saying…

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.200
He’s the one who hurt Sasuke…

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.740
Hey young girl!

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.860
I want you to know that
I’m not the fighting type!

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.610
I can see that by looking at you!

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.940
In any case,
I need to get away from here

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.400
and somehow take Sasuke to
where Kakashi Sensei is!

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.940
You…

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.650
Sasuke…!

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.940
Well! Your limit is two shots…

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.200
That’s about it…

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.780
The third shot won’t be activated…
Remember this well.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.780
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.200
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.320
but your Chakra will deplete to zero…

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.280
and in the worst case, you’ll die!

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.110
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.240
Especially in your case…

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.780
Is it the Curse Mark…?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.940
If you let your hatred take over you,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.320
and rely on the power
of the Curse Mark…

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.150
your development will stop there.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.360
If that happens, you won’t
be able to beat Itachi.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.400
In any case,
I need to get control over this.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.940
Sasuke!

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.940
I see you’re…

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.400
the one I failed to kill that time.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.450
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.990
And as long as there are others to kill…

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.490
I will never disappear.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.940
L-Let’s run! Everyone!

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.650
Die! Sasuke Uchiha!

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.320
Sakura!

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.240
Out of the way!

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.940
Sakura!

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.070
How could she stand
in the way of that Gaara…?

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.200
Darn! Darn!
What the heck should we do?!

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.530
Just with him, I don’t want to…

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.650
Now, let me feel it!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.320
Why…?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.490
Gaara, Please calm down.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.940
It’s no use after all…

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.610
The sand gets in the way.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.280
Gaara…

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:29.570
Yashamaru!

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.490
I may not look it,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.360
but Lord Kazekage charged me
to look after your physical condition

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.940
as a member of medical corps
and to be with you.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.400
Please do not do such things
in front of me.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.030
Although the sand will protect you…

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.940
Yashamaru… I’m sorry…

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.940
Oh, this..? It’s just a scrape.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.940
A scrape…

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.150
Is it painful?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.860
A little bit… But it’ll heal in no time.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.940
Hey Yashamaru…

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.200
What is it?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.650
What is pain?

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.940
I’ve…never once had a wound so…

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.150
I wondered what it’s like…

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.940
Well…

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.610
How can I explain it?

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.700
It’s like it’s distressing, or difficult…

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.450
In other words, to be hit or cut…

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.780
Maybe I should say it’s a feeling
of not being able to bear it,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.530
of not being able to stay normal…

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.320
I can’t say it well,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.900
but I suppose it means a situation
that’s not very good.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.700
Yashamaru…

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.740
Yes?

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:20.200
So, do you dislike me…Yashamaru?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.200
People live their lives while
hurting others and while being hurt.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.530
But it’s not so easy for
people to dislike others.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.780
Thank you, Yashamaru.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.570
I think I sort of understand
what pain is now.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.940
I see…

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.320
So…maybe I’m injured too?
The same as everyone?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.610
I'm always…in pain.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.700
I’m not bleeding, but…

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.490
I’ve been having a lot of
pain around…here.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.940
Blood does flow from a wound
on the body

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.900
and the wound may appear painful.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.530
But as time passes, the pain
naturally disappears.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.240
By using medicine,
the healing is even faster.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.610
But what’s dangerous is
a wound of the heart.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.280
Nothing has more trouble healing.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.780
A wound of the heart?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.240
A wound on the body and
a wound of the heart are slightly different.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.570
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.780
it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.780
But there is one thing that
can cure a wound of the heart.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.940
However, this is a complicated medicine.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.820
It can only be given to you
by another person.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.110
What? What must I do to…?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.570
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.280
That is…

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.570
love.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.530
Love?

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.700
Yes.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.490
H-How can I get it?
What do I need to do for this pain to be…?

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.400
It has already been given to you, Gaara.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.700
Huh?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.200
Love is…a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.940
to love and watch over that person,
just like my older sister did.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.360
I believe that my older sister
loved you, Gaara.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.940
Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a living
 person used for the purpose of attacks.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.940
The sand which automatically tries to
protect you is like the love of a mother.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.320
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother’s will.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:25.780
My sister…probably wanted to
protect you even more after dying…

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.110
Yashamaru…

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.950
What is it?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:37.030
Thanks for what you did earlier…
for stopping me.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.200
You are welcome.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.650
You are a precious person
who is near me, Gaara!

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.780
Can you understand…my pain?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.940
It tastes like iron…

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:37.570
Twenty!

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.490
Twenty-one!

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.530
Leaf…Hurricane!

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.940
How many did you take
down Kakashi?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.450
Twenty-two.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.030
Huh, it seems I win again!

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.780
That was my twenty-third.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.360
Yeah, yeah all right…

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.940
That poser attitude of yours
still makes you cool!

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.940
That’s the reason you are my rival!

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.610
– Let’s go! 					– All right!

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.110
Hey, Yashamaru…
I have a favor to ask!

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.940
What is it?

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:53.990
I want some ointment.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.990
Sorry about earlier…
lt must’ve hurt.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.860
This is medicine.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.950
If you want it--

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.030
Go home…freak!

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.650
Oh, what the--?!

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.650
Hey, be careful, you brat--

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.940
Y-You are…

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.740
– Again… 					– Go home, freak!

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.070
These eyes…

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.990
Y-You are…

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.530
Why…? Why?!

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.950
H-Hey!

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.940
What the--? What’s going on?

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.240
It’s…it’s Gaara!

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.700
Hey! This guy's dead.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.990
Father…

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.450
As I thought… Things don’t go well…

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.940
Why is it…that only I’m such a freak?!

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.030
What…am I?!

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.990
The thing that can cure
a wound of the heart is love.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.940
Yashamaru!

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.530
Huh?

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.650
Why? Why me…?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.900
Why always me?!

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.820
Who…? Why…?

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.940
Well done…Gaara.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.490
Yashamaru…!

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.320
It’s those eyes…

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.240
What’s the matter?
Weren’t you gonna run away?

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.610
Sasuke…

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.900
Naruto…

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:31.450
What are these two…to you?!

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:38.400
T-These two are…my friends!

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.900
Try laying so much as
another finger on them!

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.450
I’ll clobber you!

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.820
So…what’s the matter?!
Weren’t you gonna clobber me?

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.070
Hurry up and come at me…

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.400
Darn it!

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:28.070
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:39.400
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:55.070
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:00.110
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.530
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:10.780
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:20.940
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:31.740
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:42.280
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.940
Forge on strong

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.320
I know this guy’s strength.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.450
I may seem like a senseless
weakling to him.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:13.030
But…what’s…?
What’s this feeling welling up inside me?

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.940
I don’t know…

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:21.450
I don’t know,
but I just don’t want to lose to this guy!

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.900

The Two Faces of Gaara”
