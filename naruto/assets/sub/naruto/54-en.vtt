WEBVTT

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.810
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.060
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.360
One more time

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
Are you really happy

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.610
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.980
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.610
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.850
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.850
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.900
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.060
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.850
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.900
One more time

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.270
Master Jiraiya…I believe in you.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.690
The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.190
Well well…

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.690
You don’t sleep at all?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.940
What do you want?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.150
I thought I’d crush you now.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.150
If I do that,
there’d be the possibility for me,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.850
after the first battle,
to be able to fight Sasuke.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.150
I know your Sand attack.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.940
I wonder which is faster,
yours or my Sound.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.810
In the full moon…

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.110
in the full moon, his blood boils.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.810
W-What the heck…are you?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.770
Amazing… So that’s his true form?

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.850
But…is it okay?
He’s a Sound Ninja …

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.190
It’s all right.
He’s long since served his purpose.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.850
I thought he was a guinea pig
in order to see…

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.850
the power of the boy
called Sasuke or something…

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.020
Why…is he with the Sand Ninja?

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.150
No, that’s not necessary anymore…

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.850
Actually, I’d already been ordered
to seize Sasuke.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.400
But I failed…

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.060
What did you say?

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.900
That’s right.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.020
…for the likes of you?

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.440
Are you looking to take me on?

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.310
You willful little brat…
Don’t mess around with grown-ups.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:30.860
Don’t be so arrogant.
The situation is in my favor.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.850
It’s also been found out that
I’m a minion of the Sound.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.850
Then…if they find out that you’re
having a secret meeting here with me…

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.520
the plan to destroy the Leaf Village
and everything will be for naught!

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.560
I heard…
that you’re Orochimaru’s right-hand man.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.060
Being revealed to them and coming
nonchalantly to meet with me…

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:05.360
You must be a fool.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.610
Well…to be exact, my true identity
wasn’t found out…

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.360
I let them find out.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.060
I wanted to see how far
the Leaf Village would go…

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.310
Even after that it wouldn’t
be too late to seize Sasuke.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.690
If you guys are going to fail,
we’ll back off immediately…

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.440
It’s a plan that was originally
posed by the Sound, so.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.480
The Sand is invisible until
the last moment.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.850
This is the will of the Kazekage.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.850
Holy smokes…

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.980
That’s fine.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.690
This is the carry-out plan from Sound.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.850
Okay.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.730
And please…tell them about
this plan soon.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.480
Yeah.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.850
I know.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.190
Okay, I’ll be going.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.850
To think our allied nation,
the Village Hidden in the Sand,

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.060
has been already associated
with the Sound…?!

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.850
I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.770
Oh, by the way…

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.860
I’ll take care of the clean up.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.610
No, I’ll do it…

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.610
As the member of Sand Village
of the Land of Wind,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.980
I must do what I can for my allies…

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.110
Besides…it’s just one mouse.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.190
It’ll be easy.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.270
Well well, it’s Mr. Proctor.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.060
What in the world are you
doing here alone?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.520
It seems I have no choice,
 but to fight.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.360
Leaf Style…

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.810
Crescent  Moon Dance!

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.940
I can’t pull it out.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.610
This technique is…
the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.110
Being able to manage it
at such a young age.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.850
As expected,
this village is full of talented Ninja.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.850
Your talent with a sword is superb.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.020
But, a real sword with substance
can be stopped.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:21.230
However…a Wind sword can’t
be stopped by anyone.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.020
Take that!

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.730
That does it!

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.270
Nice, nice.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.850
Hey…

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.850
This is paradise.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.230
Hey, I said.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.980
Isn’t it time for you to turn
this way already?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.900
If you join my training,
I’ll give you lots of “service.”

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.850
P-l-e-a-s-e.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.610
So you finally came out…
I was waiting for you.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.690
What?!

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.190
Are you making fun of me?

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.310
Right back at you.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.520
I’m hungry.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.440
Let’s get back to the inn.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.310
Owww, darn it!

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.230
Okay…I’ll teach you a technique.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.190
Do you really mean that?

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:07.270
Do you remember what I told you
yesterday about the two types of Chakra?

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.850
Huh? Yesterday’s talk?

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.900
You know, what you said about blue
and red Chakra or something.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:17.850
Oh… What about it?

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.400
You said that when a great power
came out, you felt red Chakra.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.520
Yeah, it was like that.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.190
Try building up that red Chakra right now.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.110
Hmm. Even you say so…

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.360
I’ll give it a try, but…

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.980
How about it?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.850
Hmm, it’s not right.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.900
It’s the same Chakra as always.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.850
Jeez, you have no talent.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.900
Don’t be talking all high and mighty!

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.940
In the first place,

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.560
I really don’t understand those
two types of Chakra myself!

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.060
Just keep trying.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.150
Humph… So he doesn’t understand it…
himself, eh.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.310
It seems Naruto himself still hasn’t
realized that

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.060
the red Chakra is
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.860
Well, guessing from his story…

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.520
it seems the excitement of danger
and heightened emotion

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.440
are the key to summon
the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.060
No good, not good.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.850
Only the usual Chakra’s coming out.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.850
Say, Pervy Sage…

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:51.060
What the heck does the red Chakra and
the technique you’re going to teach me

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.270
have to do with each other?

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.850
Listen, boy.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.770
For the technique
I’m about to teach you,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.400
the Chakra you’ve had until now
is not nearly enough.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.610
Therefore, you’ll have to able to
pull out and use the “other” Chakra

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.730
that has been dormant within
you at any time you need.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:19.110
But how do you know that
I have such a Chakra?

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.980
Oh, just what I wanted to hear.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.400
Actually…

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.560
it’s because I’m a sage.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.310
Jeez…that’s no answer.

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.520
Anyway, the special Chakra
that only you have

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.850
will become your greatest weapon.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.900
Greatest weapon?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.850
Not using that is like wasting treasure.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.520
There’s no need to forcedly do
the same training as everyone else.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.020
Everyone has what they’re good at
and poor at.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.980
You have your own style.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:14:00.770
Your training until now, maintaining
and releasing a set amount of Chakra,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.150
was in other words,

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.650
training to control the suppression of
Chakra so that you wouldn’t get exhausted.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.610
But you who have a lot of stamina

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.360
should be about power rather
than a cheap trick.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.730
You, who has two types of Chakra
and doesn’t exhaust easily,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.850
should release the largest amount
of Chakra you can

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:26.400
and train to increase the absolute amount
of Chakra that you can use.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.900
Then there are tons of Jutsu
and techniques you can use.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.730
What, for example?

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:41.230
For example…summoning Jutsu
that I’m going to teach you now.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.150
Summoning?

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.520
Right.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.850
It’s a type of spatio-temporal technique

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.360
where you sign a contract in blood
with all kinds of living creatures

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.310
and summon whenever you like
with Ninjutsu.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.770
Oh! That sounds awesome.
Teach me quick!

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.980
Before that…

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.730
first, it’s necessary to
use up all of your usual Chakra.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.770
Okay!

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.850
Leave it to me.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.060
Well… So you can use the
Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:34.310
I have a good idea how to get rid
of my Chakra quickly.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.940
Well, you’ve multiplied quite a bit.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.650
Listen up. We’re going to have
a battle royal now.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.150
The last one left will be
the strongest me…

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.520
We’re going to determine
the me among me!

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.110
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.850
I see.
Good thinking considering he’s stupid.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.650
Okay, let’s go!

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.270
My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.770
The finale is near at last.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.850
Well done.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.850
Sure enough, I’m the strongest me.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.810
It looks like you’ve finally used up
almost all of your Chakra.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.850
Now, at last I’ll teach you
the technique.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.520
Oh, I’ve been waiting!

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.850
First, I’ll show you.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.850
Watch carefully.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.860
Summoning Jutsu!

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:43.980
Ooh, so cool.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.150
Open that scroll.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.850
It’s a contract with the
summoning toads

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.310
that I’ve taken over from generations.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.900
Sign your name in your own blood

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.480
and stamp the fingerprints of one hand
in blood under that.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.440
Then build up Chakra in the place
you want to summon

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.690
and set down the hand you contracted.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.230
The Sign is
Boar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:34.190
NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.060
Okay…This is fine, right?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.730
It’s easier for you to release
red Chakra right now.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.850
So give it a try.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:57.850
I already am.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.060
Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.770
Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.480
A tadpole…

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.650
This kid…has no talent, after all.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.940
Hayate…what in the world happened?

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.690
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.940
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.560
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:46.230
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:53.610
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.440
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.850
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.110
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.520
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:23.810
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:31.060
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:37.730
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:44.850
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.400
Ino! When I was going to visit
Sasuke at the hospital by myself…

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.650
why are you coming along?

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.850
Besides, what is that flower all about?

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.850
A "rose for love"?
That's so lame.

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:10.440
I chose this daffodil for him,
hoping Sasuke will get better soon.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.850
Next time, "A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope"

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.110
Cha! This is it!
