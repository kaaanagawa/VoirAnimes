WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:09.730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.280
One more time

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.980
Are you really happy

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.900
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.770
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.770
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.820
One more time

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.770
Naruto…!

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.650
He came in totally late.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.770
Hmm? Where’s Sasuke?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.320
The Dosu guy I’m supposed
to fight isn’t here, either.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.480
Hey, you guys over there.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.820
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.110
You guys are the stars
of this “final round”!

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.770
Sasuke hasn’t been found yet?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
A team of several Anbu members
are searching all over,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.770
but they have found nothing.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.360
He might already be in
the hands of Orochimaru…

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.400
If that’s the case,
we may never find him.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.190
I understand.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.610
Well-well… Lord Kazekage.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.440
You must be tired having
come all this way.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.030
No…I’m glad the arena
is in the Leaf Village.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.570
Even though you’re still young, it would
probably be a tough journey for you

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.320
if you had to go to the trouble
of traveling someplace else.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.770
Shouldn’t you decide on
the Fifth Hokage soon?

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.980
Please don’t treat me
like an old person.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.690
I’m still planning on
being Hokage for another five years…

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.940
Now then, I guess it’s
about time to begin.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.770
Everyone, thank you very much
for coming

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.610
to the Village Hidden in Leaves
Chunin Exam.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.480
We will now begin the
“final round” matches

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.230
for the eight who made it
through the preliminaries!

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.770
Please watch until the end!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.070
If there are supposed to be eight,
it looks like there’s one missing.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.610
I have something to tell
you before the match.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.360
Look at this.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.400
Huh?!

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.440
There was a slight change
to the tournament.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.820
Check who you’ll be facing
one more time.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.770
Here, I had more preliminary
matches than the others…

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.440
So the Dosu guy dropped out?

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.770
I thought I’d pound you here…

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.860
If I did that,
there’d be the possibility for me,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.770
as the one remaining after
the first battle, to fight Sasuke.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.770
W-What are you?!

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.070
Say…

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.360
…say.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.980
What?

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.320
Umm…Sasuke still hasn’t come.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.770
What’ll happen?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.070
I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak out
of the hospital room at that time.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.190
Something could’ve happened to him…

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.480
In case a competitor does not arrive
by the start time of his match…

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.280
he or she will lose by default!

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.650
It doesn’t make sense.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.770
Knowing his character,
he’d come even if he had to drag himself.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.730
Where are you going, Gaara?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.610
To verify my existence…
one more time.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.770
One more time.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.070
What’s wrong?
You should still be able to move, right?!

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.480
Sasuke! Come on!

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.400
Could it be…?

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.110
Even after I warned him to avoid
doing anything to stand out…

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.440
He didn’t kill that Sasuke Uchiha
also, did he…?

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.940
Listen up, you guys.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.070
The terrain is different,
but the rule is that there are no rules,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.570
the same as
in the preliminaries.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.770
The matches will continue until one
or the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.900
However, if I judge that it has been settled,
I’ll stop the match there.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.150
Arguments will not be allowed.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.280
Understood?

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.230
So the first match is…

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.110
Naruto Uzumaki.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.730
Neji Hyuga.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.110
Just those two remain and
the rest of you go to the waiting room.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:22.110
Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.230
Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:35.770
Uh-huh.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.770
This match will be quite interesting!

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.280
Naruto…

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.770
Say, Sakura.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.570
I understand that you’re worried
about Sasuke.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.770
But why don’t you cheer
for Naruto at least a little bit?

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.650
Hmm. You’re right.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.980
That being said,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.980
with Neji as his opponent,
Naruto has no chance of winning.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.770
That is…!

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.320
Not so, is what you’re
going to say?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.280
But to think that brat would
survive until this point…

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.940
I wonder if this is
as far as it goes

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.860
for those who survived
just by luck, after all.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.770
That Naruto.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.110
This is not a good opponent at all.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.730
No matter how you look at it,
he can’t beat the Hyuga clan.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.610
Well, that’s what I thought
at the beginning…

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.770
But you’ll all be surprised
if you underestimate him.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:43.900
Akamaru, what’s wrong?

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.150
What did you say?!

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:51.770
What?! Where?!

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.820
There!

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.780
What’s Anbu, the Black Ops,
doing here?

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.530
Is something going on…?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.480
You seem like you want
to say something.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.770
I said it before, too, didn’t I?

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.860
A failure is a failure.
You can’t change.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.280
I promise …

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.070
I’ll win, no matter what!

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.190
He has the look…
of being sure of himself…

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.900
It’s as if he’s not all worked up…

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.780
That makes it
more worthwhile for me.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.650
I look forward to your look
of disappointment…

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.440
when you know the true reality…

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.770
Stop whining.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.110
Let’s…get started!

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.860
Now then, round one.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.690
Begin!

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.650
Watch carefully, Hanabi.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:51.690
Nobody has inherited such
a strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.770
To say nothing of your older sister.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.190
More than big sister?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.860
Perhaps more than you, too.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.770
This time, it’s not an opponent
that can be managed easily.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.360
He has that Byakugan.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.900
Close combat is no good…

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.770
Does Naruto know that?

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.070
Idiot! Why would anyone
attack from the front?!

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.900
No! Naruto.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.770
The opponent can see
your Chakra Points!

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.820
They're called Chakra Points.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.230
If those pressure points
are pressed accurately…

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.070
the flow of an opponent’s Chakra
can be stopped,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.360
amplified or controlled at will.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.070
Uh-oh!

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.770
I missed, huh…?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.110
In other words, he’ll press
the pressure point if I get too close

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.770
and I’ll become unable
to use Jutsu.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.150
That means all I can do
is fight from a distance.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.530
You understand, right?
You have no way of winning.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.280
Heh… All I did was to verify your power.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.690
The real fight is just getting started!

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.400
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.530
You used your head,
didn’t you, Naruto?!

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.280
With the Shadow Clone Jutsu…

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.190
Heh. He’s an interesting kid.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.820
Shadow Clone Jutsu is
a Jonin level technique.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.280
To think he could use
such an Jutsu…

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.650
Who knows how this’ll turn out?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.980
Shadow Clone Jutsu?!

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.770
I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributed
among the clones,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.320
indeed, I can’t detect the
real one even with my Byakugan.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.070
But there’s only one real one,
after all!

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.690
Heh. Don’t be acting tough!

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.610
If you’re going to come,
then come.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.770
It’s pointless.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:22.770
In front of that Neji’s defense,
it’s not just all attacking.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.730
Hey!

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.190
Don’t…you…underestimate…

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.480
…me!

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.780
Here they come!

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.530
He hit!

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.770
Fool.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.770
Wha--?!

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.730
Dang it!

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.030
I’ll get you next time!

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.980
Here!

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.690
This guy…

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.770
Does he have eyes behind him…?

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.530
You’re going to become…
the Hokage…?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.730
With this level, it’s impossible.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.770
I can generally tell
with these eyes…

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.070
Intrinsic abilities are set.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.860
Figuratively speaking,
everything inherent about people is set.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.230
Why…?

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.440
Why are you always so
judgmental like that?

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.440
Then…are you going to say
that anybody can become the Hokage…

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.770
if they just work hard?

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.860
Only a very small percentage of
Shinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.400
Look more at reality!

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.190
Those who become the Hokage
are born with a destiny.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.650
It’s not something you become
by trying to become it.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.480
It’s determined by destiny.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.190
People must live within
their different respective currents

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.150
that can’t be defied.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:26.070
The one single…
destiny everyone has equally…

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.320
...is death.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:44.780
Those eyes…

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.980
He still holds a grudge
against the head family, huh?

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.940
So…

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.320
So what?!

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.480
I don’t know when to give up!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.820
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.440
