WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:09.730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.280
One more time

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.980
Are you really happy

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.900
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.770
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.770
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.820
One more time

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.690
Hey! Open up!

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.190
Huh?

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.280
What’s all this noise at this hour?

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.570
Idiots! I told you not to let
your eyes off him, didn’t I?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.360
Could Gaara have…?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.860
Where on earth did he go?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.480
I hope nothing bad happens, but…

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.980
Hospital Beseiged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.730
Wow, he’s sound asleep…
I wonder if he’s dead?

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.610
If that’s for Sasuke,
he’s not back yet.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.400
Hmm.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.530
Ino…

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.980
I’m way ahead of you on
Sasuke information.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.280
Missed your chance on that one,
eh, Billboard Brow?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.070
No! This is for Lee!

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.770
Huh?

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.780
The one from before should
be wilted by now too…

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.530
Oh.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.770
Lee! Stop it!

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.860
191…

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.770
Don’t touch me!

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.480
I’m…not…done yet…

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.770
Here.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.730
Thanks.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.530
I hope Lee’s better.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.770
Yeah.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.900
Huh?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.360
What the…?

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.770
Oh man, it’s all clogged up.
What a drag…

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.650
Yo!

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.770
You finally woke up, eh?

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.030
Where…am I?

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.320
In the hospital!

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.770
They told me that you’ve been
sound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.770
Three days…

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.860
Three days and three nights?!

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.730
W-What?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.530
Shikamaru! When does
the final competition start?

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.770
T-Tomorrow.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.110
What?!

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.770
Why didn’t you wake me
up earlier!

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.280
I can’t be just snoozing through
in a place like this!

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.770
And what about Pervy Sage?

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.650
Where’s Pervy Sage?!

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.770
I’ve got to have him watch
over my training.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.980
Huh? What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.770
I don’t know what’s got into you.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.360
Huh? My clothes are missing!

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.400
Where are they?
Where, where?

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.280
– Sleeping away like you’re in a coma,
– Gone!

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.150
– then running around out of control.
– Where're my clothes?!

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.480
Settle down a little!

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.820
You know what?
lt isn’t gonna make a difference

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.610
if you rush around
one day beforehand.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.650
Resting is training, too, you know…

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.320
Huh? Hey…Naruto.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.570
What in the world
is going on?

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.820
I’m…so…hungry….

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.150
Don’t keep scaring me like that…

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.690
Oh yeah.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.320
It’s such a drag but…

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.940
I bought this fruit basket as
a get-well present for Choji.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.980
But the doctor said he couldn’t have it.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.440
So let’s eat it together.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.820
Choji? Is he that sick?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.770
No, no, don’t be fooled.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.770
He got sick from eating
too much BBQ.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.070
That’s just like him!

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.940
Yeah well, and neither of you are the type
to have female visitors.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.150
So here…

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.440
Looks good.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.570
W-What is it?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.780
Since Choji can’t have any,
let’s eat in front of him.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.690
What a drag this guy is!

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.900
Huh?

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.650
No one’s here.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.770
Out to lunch?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.280
Oh well…

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.770
Okay!

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.780
Hmm?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.360
Lee, I’m putting the
flowers here, okay?

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.570
I’m still hungry!

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.780
Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.070
Oh yeah.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.770
Why…save him?

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.150
He’s an important subordinate
whom I care for.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.770
My body…isn’t moving.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.150
You jerk!

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.770
What the hell do you think
you’re doing?!

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.940
Hey Naruto…

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:20.690
During Shadow Possession Jutsu,
it’s moving me too! Okay?!

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:22.820
Sorry! Shikamaru.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.570
What the hell were you
trying to do?

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.770
Choji, are you better?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.610
Oh, Ino!

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.780
All right! The age of
the chubby has arrived!

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.940
What were you trying to do
to Bushy Brow here?!

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.770
I was trying to kill him.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.030
What?!

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.070
How can he be so calm?

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.730
Especially when he is not able to
move with my Shadow Possession Jutsu…

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.190
Why’d you have to do something
like that?

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.070
You beat him in the match, right?

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.770
Do you have a personal grudge
against him or something?

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.320
I don't have anything like that.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.650
I just wanted to kill him, that’s it.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.820
How can you say something
so selfish, you bastard?!

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.400
You…you had a lousy upbringing,
didn’t you?

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.770
All you care about is yourself.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:45.730
Or there’s something weird about him.
lt gives me the chills!

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.820
If he tries anything, it’ll be too much
of a burden for me and Naruto…

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.150
What the heck should we do?

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.070
If you get in my way,
I’ll kill you both too.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.030
What?! Go ahead, if you can!

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.690
Hey Naruto, hold on!

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.820
Should I try to scare him with a bluff?

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.610
I know you’re strong from seeing you
in the competition with him…

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.480
But…we can keep up with you.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.770
We didn’t show you our best skills
in the preliminaries.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.150
And it’s two against one!

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.360
You’re the one who’s at a disadvantage.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:28.770
If you’re smart, you’ll do what
I tell you and just get lost.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.480
I’ll say it again…
if you get in my way…

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.650
I’ll kill you.

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:36.900
Where the heck do you get off…?!

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.860
There’s no way in hell
I’ll let you do that!

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.610
I’ve been telling you
to back off, haven’t I?

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.320
This guy has the strength of a monster.
You get it, don’t you?

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.280
I have a real monster in me!
I’m not going to lose to this guy!

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.360
Huh?

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.360
I heard Naruto was here too,
so I came to see, but…

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.570
What a mess…

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.770
Well, I guess this means he’s okay.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:15.770
Huh?

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.770
What’s worth making him mad,
you idiot!

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.980
A monster, huh…?

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.230
Me too, actually.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.770
It’s just like you said.
I had a terrible upbringing.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.770
When I came into this world,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.610
I took the life of the woman
some might call my mother.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.650
So that I could become
the strongest Shinobi…

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.230
my father brought his
Ninjutsu upon me,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.610
and so I became possessed
by a Sand Spirit.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.770
I was born a monster.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.360
A Sand Spirit?

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.980
It's called Shukaku, the living wraith of
an old monk

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.770
from Village Hidden in the Sand
who was sealed inside the tea caldron.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.650
It must be a type of
cacodemon possession Jutsu,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.190
performed to a baby before it is born.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.360
To go that far…
they must have been totally nuts.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:25.110
Is it possible…that there could be
something inside him too?

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.530
What a thing for a parent to be doing!
Such a twisted kind of love.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.360
Love?

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.320
Don’t measure me by your standards.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400
Family, huh…

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.230
Let me tell you what kind of ties
I have to my family.

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.530
They’re ties of hatred,
ties of murderous intent…

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.480
My family’s just lumps of flesh.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.770
Nourished with the life of my mother,

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.070
I was crafted as the
ultimate masterpiece of the village…

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.770
The Kazekage’s child.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.530
I was taught by my father
the innermost secrets of the Shinobi…

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.150
spoiled, over-protected,
and left on my own.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.610
And I thought that was love…

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.360
Until that incident happened.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.770
That incident…?!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.770
What are you talking about?

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.780
Just what happened?!

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.770
In the six years since the time
when I was 6 years old…

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.400
My real father has tried to assassinate me
more times than I can count!

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.360
But I thought you just said that
your father spoiled you…

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.150
What’s going on here?

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.650
Those who are too strong are
apt to become feared.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.770
Born through the Jutsu,
my mind was unstable…

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.940
I guess the idiots in my village

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.980
finally realized that
I had emotional problems…

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.280
For my father, Kazekage,

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.190
at the same time I was
the ultimate weapon for the village,

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.940
I was also a dangerous,
fearsome presence.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:27.770
It seems I was labeled a dangerous figure
as soon as I turned six.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.940
And I was treated politely simply because
I was feared.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.400
To them, now I’m just a relic of the past
that they want to see disappear.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.780
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.480
When I asked myself that,
I couldn’t find the answer.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:51.770
But, as long as you’re alive,
you need a reason…

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.770
If you don’t have one,
it’s just the same as being dead.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.070
What’s this guy saying?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.770
I…can understand that…

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.780
He…is the same as me.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.860
So this is the answer I came to…

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.690
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.570
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:20.610
finally I became calm.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:28.280
By killing assassins, I finally
comprehended the reason why I live…

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.770
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.770
And if I see that all other people
in this world exist

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.770
only to make me realize that,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.150
there could be no world
more wonderful.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.530
And as long as there are
others to kill

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.400
who can make me feel
this happiness to be alive,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.900
I will never disappear.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.070
W-What’s this freak talking about…?

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.860
He’s real gone!

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.110
I was also alone…

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.820
And suffered ‘cause
I didn’t know why I was alive…

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.280
But Iruka Sensei recognized me
for who I was…

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.770
and that was the first time
I realized why I lived…

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.900
But this guy…
this guy grew up alone.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.770
And he ony feels alive
when he kills other people.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.730
H-How can there be someone like this?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.150
The worlds we live in
are too different…!

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.860
There’s no way…
that I can beat a guy like this!

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.730
W-What’s wrong, Naruto?

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.770
What? Shadow Possession Jutsu should
have stopped him from moving, but…

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.770
Naruto!

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.030
Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.110
What a drag this guy is!

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.570
Naruto!

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.320
Now, let me feel it…!

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.770
Oh no!

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.230
Stop right there!

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.360
Tomorrow’s the final round!

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.570
There’s no need to rush like this!

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.770
Or do you just want to
stay here starting today?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.770
Don’t leave me alone!

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.530
I’m not bleeding, but
it hurts a lot right here.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.610
What…am I?!

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.110
I will…kill you all without a fail.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.440
Just wait.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.820

All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:53.480
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.320

his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.770

All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:30.940
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:37.610
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:44.770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.150
Hey! Konohamaru!
How could this be the ace route?!

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.770
I'm already late!

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.650
And you're making me later
by taking a longer route to get to the field!

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.280
The final competition
will start anytime now.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.770
Darn it!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.280
Run, run, run, run!

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.770

Rush to the Battle Arena!"

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.480
I can't trust your "ace" route at all!
