WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.220
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.030
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.520
It will come, closer

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.530
Now

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.790
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.550
Now, let the tenth round begin.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.520
Do your best!

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:50.720
Fatso!

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.230
Damn it!

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.790
Those two better watch out!

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.530
I’ll end this match quickly and
turn you into mincemeat!

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.070
Then let's not play around...

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.200
I’ll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.540
You bandaged cucumber roll!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.210
I know his Achilles heel all too well
from my last battle with him.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.520
Those holes in his arm emit
a pulsing sound, so…

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.520
Ninja Art!

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.790
Expansion Jutsu!

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.190
Followed by the
Hidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530
All I have to do is to prevent him
from aiming at my ears!

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.530
Human Boulder Jutsu!

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.700
Hooray for Big-Boned!

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.770
Good!

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.470
Squash him, Choji!

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.080
This guy can attack sonically without
even touching the opponent…

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.450
But that’s only when ears are showing!

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.520
With Choji’s whole head buried,
it’s like he’s wearing ear plugs.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.560
how does anyone make a sonic attack
on a meat ball,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.930
let alone one that’s rolling?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.200
The way you are…
you can barely move, can you?

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.400
That’s where I attack!

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.270
It’s no use, I’m wearing ear plugs.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.510
No, this is the end!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.040
Oh?!

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.520
The human body is made up of 70% water,
and water is able to transmit sound waves.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.230
In other words, your whole body is like
one big ear.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.900
And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.840
Lord Orochimaru…no, Orochimaru!

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.510
I’ll have you know that...
I’m more than a mere guinea pig.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.680
Are you all right?

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.190
I-I want to eat meat…

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.060
Oh man...
And the guy went easy on him, too.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.660
Although he lost, the least we can
do for him is take him for some BBQ beef.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.930
It’s finally over.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.330
At long last, the Final Round…

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.810
With this, the preliminaries for
the third exam is completed.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.510
A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.390
I wonder what’s happened to Naruto?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.060
Let’s go outside now.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.690
Iruka Sensei hasn’t been alert recently,
so now’s our chance.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.760
Hey!

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.330
Konohamaru!

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.700
You intend to sneak out again, do you?

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.940
I-I need to go to the bathroom!

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.300
Liar!

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.170
To everyone who has advanced to
the Final Round

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.180
of the third test of the Chunin Exams,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.510
there’s one person who’s missing,
but, congratulations.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.450
Sensei…

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
Hmm?

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.520
I have a question.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.560
About Sasuke?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.090
Well, I’m sorry, but I don’t know much.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.530
But don’t worry too much.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.300
From here on, it’s up to Sasuke.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.940
Sakura, I have to step out
for a moment.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.040
Please inquire about the
details of the Final Round!

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.280
Sure.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.390
Here, in our house,
including Sasuke who’s not here,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.550
we have five Leaf,

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.360
three Sand,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.530
and one Sound.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.270
Well, I will begin the explanation
of the Final Round.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.500
Finally!

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.510
The preliminary battles have
ended without incident.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.310
It seems they’re now entering
the Final Round.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.520
This land really has become
peaceful, hasn’t it?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.990
This peaceful time has put
this country in slumber...

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.690
while all the other lands are busy racing
to expand their military.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.430
Would it be possible for us
to take it now?

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.530
Humph, I suppose.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.370
Though, I don’t know how much fun
it would be to take out that old man.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.570
Is that so?

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.320
To me, it looks like you are still have
a hesitation about it.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.350
From now on, the power of
each Hidden Village will clash

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.350
with one another in a long
and violent manner.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.620
The Sound village is also one of them…

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.530
You intend to be the trigger
for all of that…

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.530
And use him for a bullet.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.770
Our Sasuke…right?

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.510
You guess well.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.240
So well that it’s a bit creepy.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.510
Not in the slightest.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.350
I still had no idea about
Dosu, Zaku or Kin.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.320
In gathering information on Sasuke,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.390
I desired to learn their skills

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.160
and carried out tactless things like
deliberately subjecting myself to an attack.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.430
You overestimated me.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.630
It seems that you…

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.040
you don’t trust me completely…yet.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.170
Was it necessary to tell you,
my right-hand man,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.510
about the likes of those three?

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.650
You see, therein lies
the very proof of my trust.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.620
And because I do…

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.530
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.860
The Curse Mark that was given to him…

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.100
appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.600
Though, that won’t matter much.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.940
While there is still some
darkness left in his heart…

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.540
I want you to abduct him.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.710
That’s an uncharacteristically
hasty request, is it not?

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.520
There’s a little something troubling me…

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.020
Is it Naruto Uzumaki?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.530
You’re quite a sharp one,
aren’t you?

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.870
Sasuke has lived for revenge
against his older brother Itachi,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.870
and will not rest until he
has achieved that aim.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.940
Nevertheless, in battle with me,

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.540
he was aware that there were things
beyond his power and

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.680
faced death without fear.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.210
I didn’t think he’d be the type of
person who would be in a hurry to die.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.780
According to your information,

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.490
contact with that Nine-Tailed kid has
altered Sasuke’s heart and mind.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.030
So much so, that he possesses
some influence over Sasuke.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.060
The best thing to do is to get Sasuke
away from him immediately…

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.570
And quickly turn him in my color.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.410
Well, then…

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.450
Kabuto…

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.520
You...

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.150
If you wish to stop me…

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.530
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.070
You can’t possibly kill me…

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.540
Though you are strong, you’re only
in the same league as Kakashi.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.990
Just kidding…

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.290
Now, run along.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.660
I trust you.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.530
That face…

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.070
I wonder what could possibly
be going on in his head?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.970
The Final Round is where
each one of you

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.510
will show off your battle skills
in front of everyone.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.510
I want you to satisfactorily demonstrate
and show off your ability

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.110
as representative battle forces
of your respective lands.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.450
Accordingly, the Final Round will
commence one month from now.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.320
W-We’re not going to
do it here, right now?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.830
This is so that there’s
a suitable period of preparation.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.790
What do you mean?

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.660
That is to say…

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.470
Along with the announcement of
the conclusion

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.270
of the preliminary match to each
country’s Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.170
readying the summons for
Final Round requires preparation time—

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.640
not to mention the time it takes
for you examinees to prepare.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.010
This old man always has such
a roundabout way of saying things.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.520
I don’t quite get what
you’re trying to say.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.820
What do you mean?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.550
In other words,
in order to know your adversary,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.620
in order to prepare yourself,
time is necessary.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.930
Time to analyze what you learned about
the adversaries in the preliminaries...

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.530
time to take stock of your successes.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.430
The battles until now were
like actual battles-

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.970
it presupposed situations in which
you can’t know your adversary.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.100
That’s for sure…

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.510
I never dreamed that this guy
could make sand into a weapon.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.010
However, this is not the case
in the Final Round.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:46.480
Some of you might have already
revealed everything in front of your rivals…

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.550
In the spirit of fairness and equality,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.190
you will have a month to
train yourself to further your skills.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.740
Now, I can’t be thinking of this

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.510
as some sort of month-long
holiday and do nothing! Believe it!

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.610
Seriously! Seriously!

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.200
It might not be good idea to
excel too much, is it?

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.500
We failed to stay out of Orochimaru’s
watchful eye,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.270
and it was unfortunate for us both.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.770
Under this gentle exterior,
a seed of evil took root –

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.910
and it was this seed that was exploited…

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.510
Some day, through that Ninjutsu…

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.580
this child will as well…

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520
Kabuto…

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.790
Who knows?

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.930
Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.940
I have to give it you, Kakashi…

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.510
Stopping my attack from your blind spot…

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:29.520
But, you’d better ready at least
10 of your men next time.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.530
The Anbu that I prepared were
taken out without difficulty…

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.230
You’re not an ordinary Genin are you?

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.500
You caught a whiff of me and immediately
readied your weapon…

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.900
you’re quite impressive.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.440
No, I’m not all that.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.540
What do you want with Sasuke?

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.710
Depending on circumstances,
I’ll haul you off to questioning.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.720
I wonder if that’s possible
for the likes of you…

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.450
Are you looking to take me on?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.360
You are the son of the chief of the
Leaf medical corps, aren’t you?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.900
Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.140
Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.310
If you arrest me here now,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.680
you might never be able to prove
my connection to Orochimaru.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.580
Shut up and confine your answers
to my questions.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.650
What if I say “No”?

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.720
I’m the one asking the
questions around here.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.620
Now give me some answers.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.690
You’ll find out before long anyway
if you let me go,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.160
so can you make an exception
just this once?

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.530
You, willful little brat…

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.730
Don’t mess around with grown-ups.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.370
Don’t be so arrogant.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.510
The circumstances are in my favor…

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.070
I should have known.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.510
A shadow clone!

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.400
Darn…I've let him escape.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:05.740
Impressive…

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.080
As I suspected...

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.880
This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.890
where one temporarily animates
and controls the heart of a dead body.

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:20.520
Meticulously transforming even the face…

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.760
and also stopping his heartbeats
and eliminating all traces of his body odor…

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.630
in order to prepare an escape by
impersonating a murdered Anbu…

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.810
He wasn't raised as the adopted son of
the chief of the medical corps for nothing.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.640
If someone this good is working
for Orochimaru…

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.980
I can’t stay as I am now…

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.650
Now that that’s done…

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.020
I’d like to let you take your leave…

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.520
But first, for the Final Round,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.930
there is one more important
matter to take care of.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.400
Let’s get on with it,
so we can get to training!

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.530
Now, now. I want you all to
calmly take one slip of paper

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.200
from the box that Anko is holding.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.640
I’m going to go around in order…
take only one.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.220
Good, everyone has taken
a number.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.120
Then, from left to right, tell me
 the number on your slip of paper.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.530
I’m eight.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.760
I’m one.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.100
Seven.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.530
Five.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.730
Three.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.730
Nine.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:36.530
Two.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.500
Six.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.770
In other words, he has number four.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.140
Uh-huh.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.810
Very well, I will tell you

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.940
about how the Final Round
tournament will work.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.450
Huh?

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.450
Is that what these
drawing lots were for?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.620
Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:56.650
Yes, sir.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.600
He’s so far away.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.200
Is that all the Final Round is,
a tournament?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.940
Shoot! I have one extra round.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.510
Vendetta for Choji?
Give me a break!

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.180
I’m so relieved to know that
I won’t be in the same section as Gaara.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.310
Sasuke Uchiha…

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.480
Perfect.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.490
Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.520
This couldn’t be better!
Believe it!

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.590
Sasuke has to go up against him…?

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.030
Could I ask a question?

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.200
Go ahead.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.570
Does this mean that there will
only be one winner of the tournament?

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.310
That only one of us will be
able to become a Chunin?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.510
No, on the contrary.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.450
The judges of the Final Round,
of which I am one,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.680
will be made up of the Kazekage,

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.550
the Daimyo from various countries
who will assign you your missions,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.660
and the Shinobi Leaders.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.860
Through this tournament,

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.230
these judges will be able to make
a thorough evaluation,

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.430
and come to a decision as to
whether each one of you

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.330
possesses the qualities incumbent
of a Chunin.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:22.170
Even if someone loses the first round,
they can still become a Chunin.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:27.410
So there’s a chance that all
of us will become Chunin?

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.450
Correct, but conversely,
there’s also a chance that none of you will.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.520
To “advance” in the tournament,

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.490
means maximizing chances
to appeal yourselves to the judges.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.390
Understood, Shikamaru?

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.530
This is all a real pain in my…

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.230
Thank you for your patience.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.500
We will adjourn until next month.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.910
The second round will either be
No Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.540
That guy is so strong he kicked
Bushy Brow’s butt.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.650
Sand Coffin!

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:11.290
I want to fight you, too.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.530
Now that it’s come to this,
I’ve got to see Kakashi Sensei.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.330
Umm, where’s the room
that Sasuke’s in?

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.700
I’m sorry. Mr. Sasuke
is not allowed visitors.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.410
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that?!

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.870
I’m sorry, those are the rules.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.510
Why, Sis, tell me why?

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.310
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.510
Kakashi Sensei!

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.880
Say! Say!

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.450
I’ve got a favor to ask!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.850
You don’t need to say it all.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.350
Well, I thought it would
come to this so…

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.520
I searched for someone
to watch your training.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.260
Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.530
I have some matters to take care of.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.130
I don’t have the time to trouble
myself with you.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500
Oh! Aha...!

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.970
You’re going to train
Sasuke, aren’t you!

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.540
Well, don't say that.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.510
I found a sensei who’s
more reliable than I am!

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.450
Well…who is it?

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.120
It’s me!

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.150
Huh?

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:17.220
You!

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.160
The Closet Perve!

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.520
Such insolence!

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:28.130
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:36.510
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:46.320
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:54.520
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:01.260
Or else I’ll cry

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.400
You won't have to search around you

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.940
It’s all ok now.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:17.780
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:23.350
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.690
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.530
Just sing.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:36.970
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.300
The two are one

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:45.540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:51.280
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.820
Darn! I’m not satisfied with this!

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.020
I don't care if you’re elite tutor
or whatever,

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.330
but there’s no way
I’m not going to get stronger

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.460
if I’m to learn from the Closet Perve
weaker than me!

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.600
I have to get strong by any
means necessary, no matter what!

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.270
If you’re really a strong ninja,

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.500
just try to convince me
with your sheer strength!

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.510
Next episode: “Ebisu Returns:
Naruto’s Toughest Training Yet!”

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.010
I’m gonna win this time around, too!
