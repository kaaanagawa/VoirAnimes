WEBVTT

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.980
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.190
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.350
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.940
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.980
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.440
I’ll let you out of here.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.600
And I’ll grant you one wish, too.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.690
You don’t have to worry.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.890
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.690
It’s not like you’ll lose everything.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.890
Now then, your flesh is mine.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940
With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body
has once again

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.650
become unable to reanimate
for several years.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.890
However there’s a next time…

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.890
I-Indeed. My body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.480
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything…

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.020
to find my own calling.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.940
I’ve finally understood that.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.230
Even if it’s not me…

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.730
I’ll bring in the new “vessel,”
even if it costs me my life.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.020
That’s my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.850
That’s the only redemption for me…
who was worthless.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.890
Miscalculation: A New Enemy Appears!

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.060
They’re fast.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.890
Akamaru.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400
Come quick after you’ve set the bombs!

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.400
Oh no!

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.350
All right.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.350
Great.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.350
Akamaru, well done.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.940
Messing with me.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.690
Akamaru.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.230
Don’t you “arf” me, you mutt!

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.560
I’ll waste you.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.600
Hold on.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.440
You!

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.020
Kiba! Akamaru!

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.890
Damn it.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.100
What’s happening?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.890
You punks!

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.350
Where are Kiba and Akamaru?!

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.150
Another one’s come.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.400
We have no choice.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.890
I’ll take care of this, so you take
the coffin and go on ahead.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.940
Shikamaru…

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.890
Get going already.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.650
Wh-Why are you…?

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.890
I’m sorry, Naruto.
lt’s my miscalculation.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.310
Kimimaro.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.350
You were taking too long, Tayuya.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.020
And what happened to
the other three?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.890
Being none other than those
of the former “Sound Ninja Five.”

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.400
Why are you…?

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.890
Your body… Your body’s no longer…

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.810
I’m not moving with the flesh anymore.
lt’s mental power.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.850
Man, you cheater of death…

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.810
I understand a little now,
that feeling…

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.020
of being information that has escaped
from the prison of the flesh.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.730
The feeling of experiencing
a taste of Lord Orochimaru’s dream.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.520
Orochimaru…!

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.060
This vessel…is an important vessel
for the dream…

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.440
The flesh that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.890
But you guys were a bit too late.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.100
Some dangerous guy
has appeared again.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.230
That air about him is
nothing ordinary.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.520
Anyway, we need
to sort out the situation.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.270
If we were to carelessly
plunge in…

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.890
You jerk.
What’re you babbling nonsense?

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.730
Naruto!

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.310
Give back Sasuke!

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.690
Hey, wait!

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.190
Tayuya.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.890
The reason why I won’t kill you now

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.600
is because you have a mission
you have to complete.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.310
And my mission is to deliver
that to Lord Orochimaru.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.890
Isn’t it too late now?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.020
Humph. I told you.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.440
That’s the body that Lord Orochimaru
truly desires.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.890
The next vessel, huh?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.270
That’s right…

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.400
And this is the only thing that
I can do at present.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.600
I leave those two pieces
of garbage to you.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.940
Sasuke…

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.190
That punk!

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.520
Calm down, Naruto.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.980
How can I calm down?

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.270
At this rate,
Sasuke will get far away again.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.850
Naruto’s right.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.890
This is a mission to bring Sasuke back
to the Leaf Village.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.890
We must choose what would be
the most rational means

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.440
to execute the mission.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.480
Damned punks.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.020
I’ll finish this in a flash.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.150
Naruto, listen up.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.400
Please move according to the plan
that I’m going to tell you.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.400
He’s a classic close-range
combat-type fool

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.810
with Shadow Clone Jutsu
as his only saving grace.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.440
And he’s a middle-range
combat type

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.890
who binds his enemies with
a Jutsu using shadows…

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.560
and a sharp squad leader, huh?

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.600
Got it?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.350
Yeah.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.810
Come on already, you punks.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.400
It’s two versus one.
We’ve got the upper hand.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.890
It’s an opponent we can beat
if we team up.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.100
Let’s go, Naruto.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.190
All right.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.060
With garbage like you jerks,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.230
it doesn’t matter how many
of you are there.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.940
Don’t underestimate our teamwork.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.190
Let’s go!

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.890
Bring it.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.400
Now... Naruto.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.020
I’ll blow you away.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.890
Gotcha. The strategy is a success.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.940
Farewell.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.730
Blast.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.060
You tricked me.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.600
Teamwork, my foot. You little punks…

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:00.890
Blast.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.270
You wouldn’t fall for the same trick
over and over, huh..?

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.810
Small fry… You’ve got nerve.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.890
Well, I guess I’ll settle for just
having been able to let him get away.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.020
Remember this.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.890
It’s not just Jutsu that are weapons.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.890
I’m counting on you, Shikamaru.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.150
Hang in there, Sasuke.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.890
But that kid,

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.060
how wonderful it is that
he can move with that body, eh?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.560
Kabuto, I don’t know what kind
of order you gave him,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.350
but it’s a bit harsh.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.230
Not at all.
lt wasn’t an order.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:07.650
I don’t like to force things.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.810
He acted on his own.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.890
For you whom he reveres.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:22.890
Kabuto…You’ve really got
a hateful personality, don’t you?

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.770
Lord Orochimaru.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.890
To you,
Kimimaro was a perfect existence…

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:34.400
His thoughts were steeped in darkness
in the same way as yours.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.520
And he sanctified you.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.810
And he fanatically admired
and revered you.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:46.890
Moreover, he was of the Shinobi clan
with the strongest and perfect bodies

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:53.020
being the legitimate bloodline
of their Kekkai Genkai…

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.890
until a short time ago.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:56.890
Yes…

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.060
When I think about having lost him,
I still get a chill down my spine.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.690
I think about it even now…

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:12.770
The man I truly wished for…
The body I wanted the most…Kimimaro.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.400
And if only he hadn’t been stricken
with disease,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.020
the assassination of the Hokage
would’ve gone smoother.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.940
Seal!

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.890
My arms….

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.020
Now…you can no longer use
either of your arms…

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.150
And since you can't use your arms,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.310
you can't weave Sign…

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.560
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.400
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.060
Orochimaru, you fool…

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.890
It's unfortunate that we can't leave
together but, my disciple…

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.890
Let's meet in the other world
one day…

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.770
Sasuke…
Sasuke’s not here yet?

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.650
We wouldn’t have needed to go
through such an experience.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:56.400
In the world, very often things don’t go
as we want them to.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.890
It’s only a matter of time,
Lord Orochimaru.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.600
When Tayuya…comes back,
I’ll kill her.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.480
Hold it.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:28.690
Hey…!

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.900
Now then, how shall I defeat you?

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.890
You…

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.060
Those eyes…

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.270
It seems he possesses
a peculiar Chakra.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:12.730
What does Orochimaru want to do…?
Why’s he after Sasuke?

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.100
Lord Orochimaru has already
obtained Immortality Jutsu…

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:30.770
A long time is necessary to get every Jutsu
and obtain everything in the world.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.440
What does that have to do
with Sasuke?!

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.850
“Immortal” doesn’t mean that
the flesh is being maintained as is…

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.890
Before his body decays,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.890
a strong and new flesh will be made
into a vessel for his soul.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.270
That’s…

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.890
Are you saying that’s Sasuke?!

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.310
Yes… That’s right.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.350
I won’t let such a thing happen!

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.350
Idiot… What will come of sending
one shrimp punk in pursuit?

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.310
And looking at things
in terms of time,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.690
up until now you probably sacrificed
one member each time

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.690
in order for the group
to move forward.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.600
Is that guy called Sasuke
that important?

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.890
How many of your men do you intend
to sacrifice for the sake of just one person?

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.520
You incompetent punk.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.440
Heh… Indeed…

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.890
For me, this is my first mission
as a platoon leader.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.520
It’s very disquieting having
comrades gradually whittled down,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.890
and I didn’t know if my own judgments
were correct or not.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.890
As a squad leader with
the lives of the party in my hands…

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.770
respecting the lives in
the four-member party,

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.400
rather than the life of one person
taken by the enemy…

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.270
and deciding to abort a mission
that’s too dangerous, would be by the book.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.230
Then, why didn’t you do that?

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.270
The world doesn’t go
by the book very often…

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.980
Since not one person in my squad
would do something like

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:33.890
abandon a captured comrade and give up
fighting for the sake of their own safety.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.150
Me included.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.150
Being the cloud-loving loafer myself,

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.890
I am not cut out to be a squad leader
who gives orders to comrades.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:56.650
The only thing I can do for them...
is to have faith in them.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:01.230
Listen. I’m not thinking anything
like they were sacrifices.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.310
I’m not thinking anything
like they’ve died.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.600
Don’t mock my comrades.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:15.890
I got you.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.190
Summoning Jutsu!

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.020
This doesn’t…look so good.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.890
I’ll play a melody of death for you.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.890
Don’t you mock us,
you damned punk.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.020
I won’t let you take Sasuke,
no matter what.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.270
Interesting.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.560
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.690
And you smiled

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.100
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.890
In my own words

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:40.650
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.060
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:51.890
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:57.560
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.850
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:10.890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.940
I feel so sad

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.900
But…

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.480
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.520
And you smiled

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.190
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.270
In my own words

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.890
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.900
And you smiled

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.560
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.520
In my own words

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.060
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.270
Damn it! What'll I do?!

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.480
He's trouble enough yet,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.890
but his Chakra has increased
several ten-fold!

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.480
It's no good. I can't use it here yet.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.150
But if I stay like this, we'll…

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.810
I get it, Akamaru.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.560
It's like you said.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.480
I have no choice but to use it!

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.890
Next time: "Roar and Howl!
The Ultimate Tag-Team!"
