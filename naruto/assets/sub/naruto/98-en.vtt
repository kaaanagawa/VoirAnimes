WEBVTT

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.480
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.980
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.190
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.600
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.600
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.270
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.100
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.400
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.770
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.060
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.230
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.350
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.940
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.440
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.310
Tsunade's Warning:
Ninja No More!

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.020
Good work, Akamaru!
You nailed it!

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.520
Midair Dynamic Marking!

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.650
Next, three twists!

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.940
Aim carefully!

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.810
Can one call that a walk?
No, I don’t think one can.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.230
I can’t gather insects at ease.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.690
It’s so great…

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.480
that the three of you have things
you’re good at and that you love…

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.150
I hope you’ll find
something like that too, Hinata.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.440
You're right…

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.940
And, what is it?

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.900
You had something
to tell me, didn’t you?

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.810
Umm…

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:55.890
Yeah…

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.890
So, using that as a hint,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.560
think about the fastest way
to get to the destination.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.690
Start!

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.150
Everyone!

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.810
I’m sorry this happens all the time,
but class is over for today.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.890
Yippee!

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.890
– Why? 					– Huh? Not again.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.560
The handout is your homework!

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.060
– What?! 					– Huh?!

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.270
I’m so happy we didn’t have
the class for Taijutsu.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.400
But these days,
class either finishes in the morning

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.230
or we have the whole day off…

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.100
I wonder if that’s really okay.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.270
What’s up with acting like
a serious student?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.150
Right, Konohamaru?

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.770
Huh?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.890
Konohamaru?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.900
Konohamaru!

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.900
What do you think you’re doing
with Grandpa's things?!

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.890
Honorable grandson…

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.230
Those belong to my Grandpa!

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.190
Where are you taking them?!

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.980
Uh…you mean these?

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.890
They are no longer used,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.440
so I thought I’d put them into storage
in a different location.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.100
No longer used, you say…

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.890
You think it’s okay to take Grandpa’s
things away without permission?!

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.310
The Fifth Hokage will be using
the chambers, you know.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.190
The Fifth Hokage?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.400
Y-Yes.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.650
The next Hokage
has finally been decided.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.190
The village can have peace of mind now.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.480
That person apparently
doesn’t smoke tobacco…

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.230
What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.100
It’s too soon for that!

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.350
When you depended on
the Old Man up to recently!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.980
What a lovely fragrance…

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.060
Huh?!

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.560
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.230
That’s exactly my question for you!

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.980
You perverted kid…

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.650
I dare you to say that again!

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.400
Huh? You want me
to say it again?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.600
Per-vert-ed kid!

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.890
Don’t call me that!

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.890
Lady Tsunade!

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.810
The elders are all waiting,
so we had better hurry.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.890
Yes, I know.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.600
Be careful, little boy.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.940
Please be more conscious
of your actions.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.690
I’m the person
who has to deal with the complaints…

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.890
Okay, okay.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.900
I’m not a little boy!

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.890
Who the heck are you?!

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.480
That’s my question…

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.900
Naruto!

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.890
Konohamaru?

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.850
Long time no see!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.480
Hey, more importantly, have you seen
a big-boobed, scary old lady…

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.600
I mean, young lady?

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.890
I did see her!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.730
– Where did she go?!
– Who the heck is she?!

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.890
Who is she?

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.940
She has to go
to the hospital straightaway!

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.730
Hospital?

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.230
That lady may not look it,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.890
but she’s an awesome
Medical Corps Ninja!

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.310
She finally came back to the village
to become the Hokage, so…

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.150
what is she taking her sweet time for?!

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.810
Hokage…

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.940
The Fifth Hokage.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.020
She better do what
she promised to do.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.480
You’re lying…

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.230
Huh?

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:17.900
I don’t believe you!

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.890
It’s a lie!

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.890
What?

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.770
There are seven birds within 50 meters
behind me in the direction of the “2.”

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.270
Tenten…?

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.060
Neji!

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.730
I just heard that that Lady Tsunade
has returned!

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.810
It’s the real McCoy.
Wanna go see her?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.560
Sorry.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.650
But I’m not interested.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.190
Huh?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.400
So there were…

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.270
eight birds, huh…

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.270
Listen carefully, Tsunade.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.440
We must call the feudal lords

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.890
and announce the fact that
the Fifth Hokage has been chosen.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.850
We will start preparations today
for the inauguration ceremony in the village.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.770
Feudal lords and ceremonies
are just a big pain.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.890
Tsunade!

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.890
Yes, yes, I know…
This is also the job of the Hokage.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.900
– Genma! 					– Here!

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.520
– Aoba! 					– Here!

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:55.890
Issue an official notice and

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.890
convey this matter to those in the village
within the next few days.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.900
We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.770
– Yes, ma'am! 					– Yes, ma'am!

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.480
I hate you, Grandpa!

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.890
Why did you have to die?

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.850
The Fifth Hokage…

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.890
Gimme a break,
my shoulders are so stiff.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.890
I wish I could just down
a nice cup of hot sake and relax.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.890
Lady Tsunade!

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.350
Wait a second!

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.810
Before you do that,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.100
you have something else you need to do,
Old Lady Tsunade!

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:39.560
What was it?

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.440
I told you, didn’t I?!

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.440
About Kakashi Sensei and
Sasuke and Bushy Brow!

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.890
Oh…right, right.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.650
Hey, if it isn’t Naruto!

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.060
Huh? Shikamaru?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.100
Why are you in a place like this?

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.520
That’s my question–

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.650
Why are you in a place like this?

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.850
I have no idea why,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.730
but my father told me
to come along with him.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.270
What’s up with that?

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.230
Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:10.940
Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.310
Are you taking proper care
of the deer?

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.600
The antlers of the deer from
that area make very good medicine.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.350
Yes, I’m somehow managing.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.650
Hey, Naruto, who’s that person

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.890
who acts like such
a big shot when she's so young?

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.020
That’s apparently the new Hokage.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.890
Huh?!

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.890
Despite her appearance,
she’s an old lady in her fifties.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:30.890
Yikes!

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.150
Well, see you again sometime.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.310
Yes, ma’am.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.350
All right, to the hospital!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.890
See you later, Shikamaru.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.060
I’m will show you an awesome
new technique I learned!

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.730
That’s the new Fifth Hokage…?

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.100
Hey, Shikamaru.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.400
That person is the strongest
and most beautiful person in the world.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:53.560
Huh?

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.400
I mean, she’s the lone female
amongst the Legendary Sannin.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.890
Huh… A female Hokage?

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.980
I’m not very comfortable with women…

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.600
Huh?

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.850
Even though they're unusually frank,
they always hang around and

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.770
you're never quite sure
whose side they're on.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.890
They always think they can make
men do whatever they want.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.770
Anyway, they’re just a pain.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.890
Hey Shikamaru…

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.350
Without women,
men wouldn’t be born.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.600
If women weren’t around,
nothing good would come of men.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.730
No matter how hard-edged
a woman might be,

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.600
she’ll show her gentle side
to the man she loves.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.520
I can’t believe that Pa’s saying that…

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.650
when he's tied to Mom’s apron strings.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.230
You’ll understand once
you reach that age.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.480
Oh no!

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.890
Let’s hurry up and
get our business done…

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.100
because Mom will chew us out
if we’re late.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.350
Hurry up, Shikamaru!

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.690
Looks like nothing will come
of some men

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.900
even if they have a woman.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.890
Konoha Hospital

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.350
I’m coming in.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.770
Who are you…?

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:30.600
What a beautiful woman…

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.060
Sakura, Sakura!

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.770
Everything will be all right now!

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.650
I brought along an awesome person.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.650
Sasuke will be fine now!

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.100
Naruto…

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.150
Those two flowers aren’t from
the same day.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.270
So this kid is coming here
every day, huh…

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.890
I heard from Guy Sensei…

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.690
Please save Sasuke.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.770
OK, leave it to me.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.060
Sasuke!

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.650
Sasuke…

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.190
Sasuke!

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.060
Sasuke, you…!

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:30.190
Hmm, despite his appearance,
that Naruto is pretty considerate.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.600
Huh?

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.150
Next! Next!

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.100
How disgraceful!

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.730
To be taken down by
just two insurgents.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.560
And here I thought you were a genius.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.440
I’m sorry…

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.890
All right! Kakashi Sensei’s done!

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.560
Next, Bushy Brow!

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:57.350
Please hurry up and
take a look at my disciple Lee!

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.690
Lee!

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.650
I brought Lady Tsunade here!

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.690
That’s your disciple?

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.310
Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.560
I see…

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:27.650
Naruto.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.440
Huh?

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.520
Is it really okay for you
to be idling away your time here like this?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.890
Uh, I almost forgot!

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.890
I had an appointment to
meet Iruka Sensei!

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.230
Go on!

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.900
OK! I’ll leave the rest in your hands!

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:40.890
All right!

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.190
Hey, Naruto!

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.150
You’re late, Iruka Sensei!

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.600
Sorry, sorry.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.350
There were lots of things to do
with respect to the Fifth Hokage.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:55.100
I guess…

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.850
Thanks for waiting!

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.890
I’m digging in!

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:07.810
Naruto.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:08.560
Huh…?

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.400
You have really developed compared
to the time when you wanted this.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.600
I have, haven’t I?

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.520
You think so too, right?

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.480
This headband that I received
from Iruka Sensei

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.940
suits me perfectly, don’t you think?

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.690
Stop being so cocky!

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.890
You still have a long,
long way to go!

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.020
You have lots of work to do!

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.020
Listen carefully, Naruto!

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.270
The Leaf Village is in
a very difficult situation right now.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.900
Starting with the Third Hokage,
we lost many fine Shinobi.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.900
The current strength of the Leaf
is less than half what it normally is.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.890
Despite that, we must continue
to carry out our missions.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.440
Why is that?

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.440
If you don’t have enough manpower,
you should turn it down.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.020
No, that won’t do…

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.100
If we turn down our missions,

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.310
it would be like announcing
to other countries our weakened state.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.850
Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailing
will probably be assigned to missions.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.350
I see…these are difficult times.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.850
Hey! This concerns you too!

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.890
You need to play an active role
and carry out your duties

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.100
in order to aid Lady Tsunade.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.890
Yeah.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.100
But, before I do that,
I need to satisfy my stomach.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.890
That’s just like you.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.190
Do your best!

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:32.900
Seconds!

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.890
Hey, hey!
How'd you finish so fast?!

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.560
I'll be straight with you.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.060
Give up being a Shinobi.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.480
L-Lady Tsunade…
don’t joke like that.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.890
There are numerous bone fragments
in the area around important nerves.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.440
Moreover, they are deeply embedded.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:14.600
You’re not physically capable
of carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.270
Come now, Lady Tsunade,
don’t joke like that…

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.520
Even if I were to operate…

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.190
Don’t be fooled, Lee!

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.650
That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.520
You changed yourself
using the Transformation Jutsu,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.690
you evil woman!

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.480
Who the heck are you?!

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.600
Don’t I have any…chance?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.810
There is no one besides me
who is capable of doing the surgery

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.440
and it would take too much time.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.600
Furthermore, there is a huge risk…

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.310
Risk?

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.890
The probability of
a successful surgery is 50% at best,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:05.890
and if it fails…

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.890
You’ll die.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.650
Guy Sensei!

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.890
I’m not at all ready
to throw in the towel!

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.890
Guy Sensei, what’s this god-awful
bitter rice dumpling?

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.600
They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.600
If you eat one hundred of them,
they should heal your wound.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.400
I see, if I don’t eat
one hundred of them,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.060
my wound won’t heal, right?

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.730
N-Not in a single day!

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.150
It’s better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:57.890
Lee…

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:25.520
Lee…

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.150
If I knew this was going to happen,
I shouldn’t have brought you to him.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.650
Don’t say that…!

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.850
I am painfully aware of how you feel,
but it’s better to be clear.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:00.060
Because it’s something he’ll have
to understand sooner or later.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.400
The longer we wait…

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.890
the harder it will be for him.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:24.400
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.890
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.890
On your still shoulder

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:38.690
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:44.190
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.940
That hold us together

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:58.810
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.480
you say laughingly

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:07.350
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.270
Like a comet,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:18.480
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:25.690
You bring light into my heart

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:35.900
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:44.890
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.890
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.020
Konohamaru, just come out
from there already!

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.890
Shut up!

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.270
Listen, I'll treat you to
a bowl of ramen!

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.520
Don't want any!

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.480
OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:04.890
You're such a pest!

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:06.520
What did you just say?!

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.440
In that case,
I'll pull you out by force!

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.890
Be ready for that!

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.980
Next time:
 "The Will of Fire Still Burns!"

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.850
Don't miss it!
