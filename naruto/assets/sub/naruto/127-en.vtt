WEBVTT

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.580
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.790
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.950
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.120
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.660
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.540
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.580
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.830
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.500
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:28.490
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.620
That form…?!

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.580
So that’s the extent of
the rumored “Absolute Defense”?

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.700
How disappointing.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.370
I see… You were wearing sand, eh?

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.620
Your opponent’s not just him!

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.450
I’m here, too!

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.790
Th-That attack just now…

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.160
It would’ve been dangerous
had I not been protected by sand.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.950
M-My body is still…

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.490
I’ll just be a hindrance like this.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.370
Annoying sand…

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.000
You’re first, Gaara.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.410
He yanked out his spinal column?!

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.870
Vengeful Strike:
                              The Bracken Dance

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.950
Dance of the Clematis Flower.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.120
Vine!

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.580
Flower!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.080
A bone of the strongest calcification…

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.120
It will pierce you,
sand defense and all…

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.950
No time…huh?

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.580
Ultimate Defense: Shukaku’s Shield!

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.620
Kabuto…

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.660
How much longer will
Kimimaro hold out for?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.080
I think he should still
be okay for a while…

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.490
I did all I could with the treatment…

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.910
But there’s not nearly enough
information about his body.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.950
I think it’d be quite different
 if we had something

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.540
like the medical history
and treatment data of his clan.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.000
What came out after looking into it

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.910
was the bloody history of how
the Kaguya Clan became just him…

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.870
Fools who provoked the great land of
the Village Hidden in the Mist into battle

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.950
with just their clan
and were annihilated.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.660
The Kaguya Clan was
a foolish clan that liked battle.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.790
The battlefield was the only place
where they could be at peace.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.490
But it was long ago when
a simple-minded group

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.250
that only enjoyed slaughter
was acceptable…

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.790
The times are different now.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.200
Doing something like fighting
only with power

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.830
against a governed organization
like the Mist…

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.160
can only be called an act of fools
rushing towards death.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.500
And then you saved only he
who was the youngest

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.790
and the most exceptional
among the Kaguya Clan…

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.490
That kid possessed the power that
would be feared even by the fighting clan.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.700
So it seems he was kept
in prison the whole time.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.490
It would’ve been a waste to let him…die.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.490
Who wouldn’t want
that rare Kekkei Genkai?

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.870
He possesses a strong
and firm bone structure

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.490
and a defensive power to
repel all kinds of physical attacks.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.250
And if turned to offense…

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.660
the bones become
a most powerful weapon.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.580
It’s because I’ve fought him once
that I understand this.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.000
That sand shield is
an absolute defense, no less.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.790
And that unusual form…

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.160
It’ll be okay.
There’s no way it’ll be broken!

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.660
It’s hard…

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.490
I gathered minerals with
great hardness from the ground,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.490
applied pressure with Chakra
and mixed them into the sand.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.250
You… that unusual Jutsu…

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.490
It’s the Kekkei Genkai, right?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.120
The Kaguya Clan…

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.660
The ability which now
only I possess.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.330
The last one of the clan, eh?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.700
Then it’ll die out here today.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.580
Indeed, that might happen.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.620
Due to sickness,
my body will not last so long…

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.620
But, the clan will not die out.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.620
Besides I’m not alone.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.620
This is the “Earth” Curse Mark…

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.410
With this…

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.830
I can become a part of you,
Lord Orochimaru.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.370
Let’s get everything, Kimimaro.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.660
And let’s see the truth of
this world together.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.540
Yes.

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.950
You’re my “Vessel of Dreams.”

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.540
I’m counting on you.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.620
They are presents from me.
I hope you like them.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:15.250
Would you rather…die or obey?

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.040
Obey…

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.540
You will!

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.080
Is this the best a team
of four can do?

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.660
I’ll ask just once more…

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.200
Which would you rather choose?

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.450
Very well…

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.290
As of now, we’re the Sound Ninja Five.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.750
Not alone, you said…?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.870
That’s right…

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.870
As an existence shouldering
one part of Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.660
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru’s soul…

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.870
for all eternity.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.620
Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.580
You’re a pitiful guy.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.450
I used my big moves too much.
I don’t have much Chakra.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.160
This is the last of it.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.870
What an amount of Chakra…

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.120
You are something…

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.160
I’ll sink and confine you
200 meters into the ground.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.660
By the pressure of the sand
stuck to your body,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.500
you’ll soon be unable to move,
not even a finger…

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.490
You did it…!
This time for sure you did it.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.160
Dance…

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.120
Bracken Dance!

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.490
It is annoying…

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.490
It feels like a long time

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.750
when waiting eagerly for
something you want.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.200
Kabuto…

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.000
Stop talking like
you’re humoring a child!

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.250
I’m sorry…

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.490
But you should know
this the most, Lord Orochimaru.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.160
Nobody can beat Kimimaro,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.620
no matter what hindrance
should appear.

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.000
Thanks for saving me…

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.830
Being able to do something like this;
very impressive.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.080
All I did was ride the sand
I’m always controlling.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.870
You just have to know how you use it.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.870
Lord Orochimaru…

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.410
I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru…

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.540
At last… The destruction of
 the Leaf will begin…

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.700
Third Hokage…
I’ll teach you a thing or two.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.700
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.080
What’s the matter, Kimimaro?

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.910
No… It’s nothing.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.580
Even the Kazekage of
the Hidden Sand Village

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.330
is no match against us.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.410
Of course…

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.160
Kimimaro, it’s thanks to you…

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.490
Kimimaro!

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.000
Kimimaro, so you can’t go on, huh?

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.490
I’m sorry, Lord Orochimaru.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.160
If I can’t be of use…

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.950
then there’s no significance
to my living.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.080
How is your condition, Kimimaro?

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.490
The “Destruction of the Leaf”
resulted in an unfortunate near-miss.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.160
But the Sound Ninja Four
have gone to pick up a new vessel…

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.750
Lord Orochimaru’s new
 “Vessel of Dreams.”

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.830
Orochimaru’s brainwashing, huh…?

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.870
You’re a pitiful guy…

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.700
You’re wrong… Far from it!

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:33.540
There’s no significance to living…

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.580
But…you might be able to discover
something interesting

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.580
by continuing to live…

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.490
Like how you discovered that flower…

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.500
Like how I discovered you.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.660
This is the “Earth” Curse Mark!

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.290
With this… I can become
a part of you, Lord Orochimaru.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.490
Let’s get everything, Kimimaro…

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.490
And let’s see the truth of
this world together.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.790
I’m going to discover
the truth of this world!

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.410
With Lord Orochimaru!

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.490
He was a persistent guy,
but this is the end.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.790
He won’t ever come out again.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.830
R-Right…

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.950
I can’t go on…

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.200
We’re getting off…

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.910
It’s not brainwashing!

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:58.700
That person…
Lord Orochimaru understands me!

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.750
What do you guys know?!

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.040
He’s dead…

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.200
Could it be? Has Kimimaro…?

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.200
The likes of Kimimaro makes
no difference now…

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:47.490
Sasuke… I can hardly wait for him.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.490
He’ll come here even by himself…

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.410
I would have been totally hammered.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.490
That’s not the case.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.490
My sensei said it often…

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.160
Luck is also a part of strength.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.700
That backseat driver?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.910
He’s not a backseat driver!

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.620
It’s because…

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.910
I wasn’t good enough at that time!

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.490
I’m grateful for you saving me.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.490
But please don’t talk like that
about my sensei!

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.500
You, too…?

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.410
When you feel that

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.120
the honor of someone you revere
has been hurt,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.830
you yourself are hurt badly
and become enraged.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.870
The more important the person
you revere is to you,

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.370
the greater the feeling…

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.620
The clan won’t die out…
I’m not alone.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.200
I will remain inside
Lord Orochimaru’s soul for all eternity.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.000
That person,
Lord Orochimaru, understands me!

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.160
What do you guys know?!

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:09.290
Fighting for the sake of someone
important to you…

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.450
He was also the same
as Naruto Uzumaki…

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.490
But…the person who is important
to oneself

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.000
might not always be “virtuous.”

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.450
I wonder…

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.580
There’s no way someone evil
can be thought of as an important person.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.790
No. Even if you know they’re “evil”…

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.250
People can’t defeat solitude…

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.160
Sasuke!

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.750
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.870
And you smiled

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.490
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.290
In my own words

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:40.830
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:46.490
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:52.080
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.750
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.040
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:11.120
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.370
I feel so sad

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.330
But…

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.660
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.700
And you smiled

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.490
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.490
In my own words

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.080
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.330
And you smiled

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.750
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.700
In my own words

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.490
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:52.200
You gotta be kidding me!

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.490
What do you mean
“for achieving your goal”?!

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.870
Orochimaru wants you
only as a “vessel”!

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.750
There’s no way
 I can let you go to him!

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.410
This is no joke!

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:11.580
If you insist on going,
I have to take you back by force!

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.120
