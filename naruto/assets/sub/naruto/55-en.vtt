WEBVTT

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.750
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.000
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.290
One more time

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.000
Are you really happy

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.540
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.250
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.920
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.540
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.790
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:02.870
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.870
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.000
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:26.870
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.870
One more time

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.790
Hey! Geez.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.750
Hey, Pervy Sage!

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.630
Weren’t you going to
watch my training?!

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.870
I’m researching now.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.420
Do it yourself!

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.080
All right, then I’ll summon a frog,
a frog so big you’ll be shocked!

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.210
The Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.290
Hmm? What’s wrong?
Did a frog appear?

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.500
W-Wait a minute!

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.630
What part of that’s a frog?!

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.040
If you don’t get serious,
I won’t help you!

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.540
Shut up! I am being serious!

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.290
Then somehow find your Chakra
as if your life depended on it!

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.380
That’s what I’m doing!

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.380
Huh?!

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.870
Sasuke…

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.920
Hey Sakura!

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.830
Huh?!

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.790
Sakura! It’s about time you wake
and help me over here!

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.670
I’m not sleeping!
I’m busy right now!

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.670
Yes, yes…
Then when won’t you be busy?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.460
Later!

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.870
I can’t believe it… Geez!

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.330
A Feeling of Yearning,
A Flower Full of Hope

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.870
Some of you have probably
already heard but…

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.170
Gekko Hayate’s corpse was
found near Kikyo Castle…

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.130
What… Hayate?

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.500
No way…

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.870
That’s ridiculous!

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.210
Is the opponent Orochimaru?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.500
No…we shouldn’t jump to
that conclusion so easily.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.130
The one Hayate was following
was likely a Sound spy called Kabuto…

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.500
Well, it’s certain that Orochimaru
is trying to do something but…

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.920
So…we’ll cancel Chunin Exam
and go after Orochimaru…?!

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.040
No, he revealed his identity to Anko…

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.870
sending us a threat not to cancel.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.870
Not to cancel the Chunin Exam

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.080
for which all of the Ninja of
the Alliance have gathered!

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.960
What does it mean?

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.500
Orochimaru possesses enough power
to take down a small Land on his own.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.920
He’s a Ninja that probably
every land has eyes on.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.130
Moreover, he conveniently holds
a grudge

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.870
against this Village Hidden
in the Leaves.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.580
Any Land would desire him.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.870
So could it be…

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.290
that any Land in the Alliance
would unite with Orochimaru

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.250
and betray the Village Hidden
in the Leaves?!

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.880
Well, the Alliance Treaty is at
the same level as a verbal agreement!

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.870
As was in the former Great Ninja War…

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.290
In any case,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.790
there’s too little information
right now.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.080
Let’s end these unnecessary
suspicions.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.290
We’ve already dispatched Anbu,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.710
the black ops to each Land
to collect information.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.250
It’s dangerous to act carelessly…

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.460
That could be what the enemy
is aiming for.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.750
And also…

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.870
I trust all of you!

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.870
When the time comes,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.830
we’ll bring all the powers of Hidden Leaf
Village together and simply fight!

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.330
At that time…

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.210
Be quiet about this bruise!

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.710
Should I have stopped him forcefully…?

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.960
No visitors…?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.870
That’s correct.
I’m sorry but…

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.870
I know he’s been hospitalized,
but no visitors…?!

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.250
What’s going on?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.080
We’re also not aware of the details so…

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.210
There’s no use worrying about it here.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.170
Huh?

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.830
Should I bring get-well flowers?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.920
So pretty.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.960
Oh no!

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.670
Oh… How unusual for you to come
by to buy our flowers.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.920
N-Not really!
Why would you care?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.460
Besides, isn’t it unusual that
you’re minding the shop?

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.080
I’ll choose quickly.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.870
People don’t like flowers with
roots when they’re in the hospital

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.870
since they don’t want to
be “rooted” in the hospital…

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.630
So cut flowers are fundamental.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.630
W-What are you talking about…?

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.330
Playing dumb won’t work.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.080
You’re going to see Sasuke, right?

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.630
Mom! I’m going out for a bit!

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.870
I-Ino?!

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.830
I won’t let you be the first to visit!
I’m going with you!

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.380
A get-well visit!

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.750
Shucks… Ino pig!

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.380
I’m taking this flower…

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.710
One “rose” of love!

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.210
That’s so cliché…

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.790
Then I’ll make mine this.
“Narcissus”!

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.540
A noble flower that doesn’t
succumb to the cold of the winter,

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.250
but hopes for the spring and
waits with dignified presence…

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.880
with the wish for release from
the hospital as soon as possible.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.790
You’ve gotten pretty knowledgeable.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.790
I told you I wouldn’t lose to you!

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.000
Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.870
Uh… I need two.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.750
Why? One is fine.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.130
No… One for Lee too.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.540
More please!

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.460
– Huh?! 					– Huh?

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:36.920
Ten orders of kalbi!

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.080
You sure can eat.
Just watching you makes me feel ill.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.880
Here you are!

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.870
It’s here!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.870
This is mine, all right?
Don’t eat any of it, Shikamaru!

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.130
I won’t eat any!

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.380
What’s going on with you guys,
barbecue in the middle of the day?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.420
– Oh…? 					– Huh?

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.000
Ino and Sakura…

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.540
Shikamaru, shouldn’t you be going through
some special training or something

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.870
to prepare for the final exam?

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.080
I am…

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:13.880
Every single day…

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.670
Asuma is so persistent.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.670
Actually, Choji’s been joining us
in the special training.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.080
Really?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.250
So you took it on?

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:31.580
Yup! In exchange, he’s treating me
to as much barbecue as I can eat!

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.420
I see…

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.040
Oh, I shouldn’t have held on
for the Final Round.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.870
Don’t be ridiculous!

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.870
There are numerous people who
want to participate, but can’t!

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:43.880
That’s right!

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.210
From what I’ve heard,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.670
they’re doing some awfully
difficult things

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.380
over at Guy and Kurenai’s team!

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.460
W-What’s that?

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.630
Even though we’ve made
it this far,

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.130
to get totally thrashed
wouldn’t be very cool…

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.420
Aw man, what a drag…

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.790
Whatever the circumstances,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.830
we’ve exceeded
a human being’s limits.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.250
So I’ve used too much Chakra…

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.460
Neji, are you all right?!

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.870
Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.460
What?! A tadpole again?!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.880
You haven’t made
any progress whatsoever!

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.380
See how it’s bigger
than the ones earlier?!

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.580
How the heck should I know?!

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.150
So you want to see Sasuke Uchiha…?

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.960
Just five minutes.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.710
I can’t allow you to visit
any longer than that.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.830
His body still needs to rest…

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.880
Yes…

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.870
Sasuke. You have visitors…

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.790
Two cute young ladies…

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.750
Oh…!

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.630
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.750
Sasuke, Sasuke?

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.500
His clothes are gone!

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.290
– What?! 					– What?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.580
It’s terrible! He’s in no condition
to be walking outside yet!

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.870
Doctor! Doctor!

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.380
Sasuke…

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.420
No way…

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.170
Sasuke will, without
a doubt, desire me…

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.040
Sasuke… Where in the world
have you gone…?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.170
Could cliff-climbing be so taxing…?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.870
Damn, my body is sluggish…

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.880
Will I make it in time…?

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:06.000
Open!

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.290
Huh?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.870
Yo!

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.540
Huh… You finally made it here…

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.920
We’ll search for Sasuke
on our end.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.080
But if you happen to see him,
please contact us.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.170
– We will. 					– Yes.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.750
And also…you wanted to see Lee, right?

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.630
– Yes. 					– Yes.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.630
He’s also in no condition to move,
so please make your visit brief.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.040
Lee, you have visitors.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.420
Two cute young ladies…

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.670
Oh?!

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.580
– Huh?! 					– Huh?!

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.870
Really… even Lee!

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.000
Lee! Lee!

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.290
Lee…

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:10.330
Huh?

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:11.870
Look!

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:12.870
Huh?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.380
Lee…?!

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.170
Sakura, let’s go!

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:21.460
Okay!

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.960
200 one-armed pushups…

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.580
If I can’t do them,
100 one-legged squats…

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.710
190…!

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.750
Lee! Stop it! 					Lee! Stop it!

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.870
191…

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:49.880
Lee!

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.420
Please don’t touch me!

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.420
Don’t…interfere…
with my training…

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.380
I need two…

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.920
Why? One is fine.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.630
No… One for Lee too…

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.630
Speaking of which, Sakura,
did you hear about that Lee?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.750
What? Hear what?

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.870
Well, that Lee…

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.790
his injuries were serious and
he can no longer…

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.960
continue as a Shinobi.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.870
195…

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.330
196…

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.710
197…

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.870
198…

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.210
I’m…not finished…yet!

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.500
There’s no value in making
an effort for someone

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.500
who doesn’t believe in himself!

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.870
One…one hundred…ninety…nine…

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.870
One… One more…

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.170
One more time…!

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:43.460
– Huh?! 					– Oh!

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.170
Lee…!

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.830
I’ll…go get the stretcher.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.960
Please keep an eye on him.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.000
Yes.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.420
Hey…lno…

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.830
Huh?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.000
Why do boys…
have to push themselves?

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.420
Don’t ask me that.
I’m a girl you know!

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.130
Sorry…

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.750
The Human…Boulder!

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.920
Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Ju…!

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.870
Darn it, I don’t have enough Chakra!

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.080
What’s the matter, Shikamaru?!

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.710
Have you hit your limit already?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.710
Man! What a drag…

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.130
All right, Choji!
One more time!

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.250
Who brought that…?

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.670
The rose I went to the trouble
of bringing was a waste.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.170
My narcissus too…

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.870
Oh… How boring.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.870
Hey, Naruto!

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:57.580
The swimsuit gals have gone,
so why don’t we call it a day?

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.870
What? Let’s stay a little longer!

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.130
Come on, a little longer…
Just a little longer!

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.580
I’m hungry. And I’m pretty tired too.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.460
You haven’t even done anything.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.040
You should be thankful
I hung out with you!

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.000
He’s getting ticked off at me.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.170
All right, I got it… Sexy Jutsu!

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.380
Oh!

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:32.880
What, that’s it?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.830
What I want to do isn’t the Sexy Jutsu,
but Summoning Jutsu!

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.670
All right, all right…
Then try it out.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.210
Here goes--!

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.380
Summoning…Jutsu!

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.290
I did it!

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.290
You should die!
You have no talent!

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:55.870
Take a careful look!

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.670
Huh?

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.000
See, it has rear legs!

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.000
You idiot! Conjure one up with
hands, feet and ears!

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.960
Shut your mouth!
Having legs is better than before!

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.870
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:33.170
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.790
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.920
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:46.460
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:53.830
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.670
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.880
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.330
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.750
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:23.870
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:31.290
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:37.870
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:45.000
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:55.330
Ichiraku's ramen is
as good as usual!

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.460
If the training continues like this,
I don't mind doing it forever!

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.580
Eat, keeping eating more because
this will be the last…

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.870
What? Did you say something?

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:03.870
Do you like the food?

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:04.870
Hey master, one more bowl
of ramen please!

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.920
Good. Just keep eating away so
you'll have no regrets about your life.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.710
Next time, "Live or Die:
Risk it All to Win it All!"

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.920
Is this sage hiding something from me?
