WEBVTT

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.030
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.270
Being chased by something

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.710
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.380
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.110
For no single one,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.720
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.130
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.900
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.400
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.770
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.740
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.210
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.780
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.290
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.900
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.000
Rockin' my heart

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.780
He's late.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.730
Naruto!

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.830
Stay still.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.330
Why's it that only
our squad's teacher is late?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.240
The other squads have gone off
somewhere with their new teachers,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.810
and Iruka Sensei's also left.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.970
Don't look at me.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.810
Hey, what're you doing, Naruto?!

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.920
Hey!

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.950
It'll be his fault because he's late.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.160
Man! You're asking for it!

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.160
I like stuff like this!

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.340
A Jonin wouldn't get caught
in such a weak booby trap.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.870
That's right. You're such an idiot...!

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420
I got him, I got him...

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.350
I-I'm sorry, sir.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.790
I tried to stop him,
but Naruto did it on his own...

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.220
It's all good.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.760
Get real.
ls he really a Jonin?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.670
How can I put this?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.810
As for my first impression
of you guys...?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.710
Well, I hate you.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.450
Pass or Fail: Survival Test

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.920
Let's see.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.820
First off, let me have
you guys introduce yourselves.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.720
Introduce ourselves...

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.160
What should we say?

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:44.500
Your likes, dislikes, your future dream,
hobbies, things like that!

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.710
Hey!  Before that, please tell us
about yourself.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.610
Me? My name's Kakashi Hatake.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.480
I don't feel like telling you
guys about my likes and dislikes.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.190
I've never really thought
about my future dream...

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.830
As for my hobbies, I have many.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.400
In the end,
isn't all we know his name?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.230
Yeah.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.500
Next is you guys.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.200
Let's start with you.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.810
I like instant ramen,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.010
but what I like even more
is the ramen from Ichiraku

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.780
that Iruka Sensei treats me to.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.150
What I dislike is the three minutes

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.150
after pouring hot water
in the instant ramen.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.820
My hobby is eating and
comparing ramen!

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.490
And my future dream...

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.190
is to surpass the Hokage!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.730
And so I'm going to get
the entire village

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.830
to acknowledge my existence!

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.630
I see...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.800
this kid's grown up in
an interesting way.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800
Okay, next.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.540
I'm Sakura Haruno.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.040
What I like... I mean, who I like is...

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.150
And, my hobby is, 					I mean...

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.350
My future dream is...

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.790
And?
What about your dislikes?

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.290
Naruto!

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.330
Girls at her age are probably
more interested in love

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.830
than the Ninja Arts.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.930
And lastly.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.270
My name's... Sasuke Uchiha.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.240
I have lots of dislikes,
but no likes in particular.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.140
Oh...

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.810
And...

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.820
I don't feel like summing up
my ambition as just a dream

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.020
but I do have an ambition!

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.820
The ambition to restore my clan
and without fail...

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.290
to kill a certain man!

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.670
He doesn't...

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.540
mean me, does he?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.170
Sure enough, Sasuke's cool.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.170
I knew it...

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.280
Good!

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.810
The three of you are very distinctive
and interesting!

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.080
We'll have a mission tomorrow!

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.820
Yes, sir! What kind of mission?

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.820
First, we'll do what we can do
with just four people.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.320
What-what-what?!

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.730
A survival exercise.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.900
Survival exercise?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.830
Why are we doing an exercise

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.670
even though this is supposed
to be a mission?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.100
We've had more than our share
of exercises in the Academy!

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.270
This is no simple exercise.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.410
Then... then what kind of exercise is it?

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.750
Hey! What's so funny, Sensei?

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.860
Uh, well, if I tell you,
I know you'll grow disenchanted.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.160
What?

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.660
Of the twenty-seven graduates,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.200
only nine will be recognized
as junior ninjas.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.710
The remaining eighteen will
be sent back to the Academy.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.810
In other words, this exercise
is an extremely difficult test

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.480
with a failure rate of 66% or higher!

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.820
See, see?

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.150
You got disenchanted!

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.150
That's crazy!

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.820
To have suffered that much!

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.420
T-Then, what was
the graduation test for?

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.830
Oh, that.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.360
It was just to select those who have
the potential of becoming Genin.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.760
Whaaaat?!

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.570
Well, that's the way it is.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.440
I'll be determining whether
you pass or fail.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.770
Bring your complete set
of Ninja tools!

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.440
We meet at five in the morning.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.950
N-No way am I going to be
dropped now!

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.850
I've got to have my strength
recognized for real.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.320
I'll be separated from Sasuke
if I fail this test.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.360
This is an exercise of love!

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.030
Okay! You're dismissed.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.800
Oh... And you'd best skip breakfast.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.870
You'll throw up.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.780
Morning.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.610
Hi, folks. Good morning!

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.320
You're late!

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.820
Well, a black cat crossed
my path, you see.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.630
Ahem! Oh well...

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.330
Okay, it's set for 12:00!

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.810
Today's assignment is to take
these bells away from me by noon.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.650
Those who can't do it won't get lunch.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.380
They'll be tied to that...

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.820
and I'll eat my lunch
before your very eyes.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.820
So that was the point...

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.120
for us not to eat breakfast...

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.820
But, hold on.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.830
Why are there only two bells?

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:44.960
There are only two,
so at the very least,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.560
one will have to
go to the logs.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.730
That person will be disqualified
for failing the mission...

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.670
and will return to the Academy.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.470
It might be one person
at the very least,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.070
or it could be all three of you.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.810
You can use your Shuriken.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.150
You won't be able to take the bells
unless you come with the intent to kill me.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.820
But, that's dangerous, sir!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.650
Y-Yeah, that's right!

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.820
You couldn't even evade
a chalkboard eraser!

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.990
In this world,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.820
those who aren't skilled enough
tend to complain more.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.360
Well, just ignore the loser...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.830
Begin when I give
the "ready-go" signal.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.830
Loser, loser, loser.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.620
Don't be so hasty.
I didn't say start, yet.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.030
No way...!

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.830
I didn't see him at all.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.130
So this is a Jonin.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.830
But, that's fine.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.200
At least you came with
 the intent to kill me.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.740
How can I put this...?

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.910
I feel like I'm finally starting...

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.240
to like you guys.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.780
We're going to start.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.120
Ready... start!

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.820
What do you want to know?

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.090
I didn't think you just
came here to drink tea.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.400
The Jonin in Naruto and company's
Group Seven...

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.730
What kind of teacher is he?
ls he strict?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.170
You mean Kakashi?
Does he concern you?

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.480
I heard a rumor that concerns me.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:47.820
What's this?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.490
It's a pass-fail list of
the junior ninjas

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.660
Kakashi has been
in charge of up until now.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.890
Let me have a look.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.940
T-This is...!

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:12.280
Fundamentally, ninja must mask
their presence and hide.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.690
Okay, everyone is hidden pretty well...

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.960
Alright! Let's face off
fair and square!

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:30.960
Oh?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.960
That goof.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.030
Say, aren't you a bit
off kilter?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.870
What's off kilter
is your hairstyle!

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.750
I'll teach you the first
Shinobi Battle Jutsu...

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.820
Taijutsu.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.860
Taijutsu...?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.830
That's ninja hand-to-hand combat...

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.360
That being said...
he's going to use weapons?

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.440
Make-Out Paradise

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:16.910
What's the matter?

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.440
Why don't you come at me?

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.280
But hey... what's with the book?

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.810
Why do you ask...?

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.280
It's because I was curious
about what happens next.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.620
Don't worry.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:30.790
With you guys as opponents,

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.120
it makes no difference
if I'm reading or not.

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.830
I'm going to rip you apart!

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.400
Darn! This time a spin kick!

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.800
Man!

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.610
Wha--?!

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.980
Ninja shouldn't let the enemy take them
from behind multiple times, fool.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.080
The way his hands are positioned...

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.880
Is that the Sign of the Tiger?!

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.920
No way!

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.380
With Naruto as his opponent,

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.320
that's too strong a Ninjutsu
no matter how you look at it.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.520
That Sign...
lt's a fire-style skill.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.990
That idiot teacher's doing more
than just running around?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.690
Naruto, get out of there quick!

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:11.860
You'll die!

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.860
Too late.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.370
Leaf Village Secret!
Ultimate Taijutsu!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.710
One Thousand Years of Death!

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.950
Oh, it's not a Ninjutsu.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.450
Those two are idiots.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.090
Alright...

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.500
Even so, isn't that against the rules?

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.270
What're we supposed to do
about his strength?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.740
Darn it!

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.080
It wasn't supposed to be
like this.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:13.120
It... can't be!

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.990
This is more than just a rumor.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.830
Kakashi's test might
be a bit difficult...

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.870
Even so, this means absolutely
no one has passed...!

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.240
That's right...

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.870
Kakashi has never had someone pass.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.070
They have all...

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.810
been annihilated...

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.880
What's the matter?

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:43.650
You won't get lunch if you can't
take the bell by noon.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.720
I know that, I say.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.960
You're not very energetic,

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:50.830
considering you said that
you'd surpass the Hokage.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.900
Darn it! Darn it!
I can fight even if I'm hungry.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.770
I didn't even have dinner last night.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.440
I shouldn't have gone on a diet.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.280
I just got a bit careless earlier!

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.420
Darn! I'm hungry, so my strength...

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.720
But... I've got to take the bell,
no matter what.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.820
No matter what...

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.730
I'm... not...

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.360
turning back now!

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.800
I'm going to become a Ninja!

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.810
Security is your greatest enemy!

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.480
Now for my favorite
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.290
Seven... Narutos?

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.830
What? They're not just images?

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.830
Are they all real?
The real thing?

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.710
Not the clone,
but the shadow clone, eh.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:14.810
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.110
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.660
Those aren't just images
but actual clones!

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:29.830
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.870
It's the forbidden Jutsu
that did in Mizuki.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.200
Judging from your ability,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.770
that Jutsu should have
a one-minute limit.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:44.740
Even if you talk trash,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.810
Naruto is Naruto
after all is said and done...

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.650
You still can't beat me with that skill.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.820
W-What?! Behind me?!

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.490
Ninja shouldn't let
the enemy take them from behind.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.260
Right, Kakashi Sensei?

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.330
Using the Shadow Clone,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.830
I had one of them come up

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.840
from the bottom of the river
and sneak behind you!

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.270
Here's one for that attack
on my butt earlier!

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.380
Naruto, not bad!

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.810
So... a diversionary tactic, eh?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.820
Now... allow me to punch you!

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360
What?!

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.630
The one who got punched was...

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:46.900
Naruto?

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.810
Ouch!

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:50.940
You...!

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.980
You're Kakashi Sensei, right?!

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.450
You used the Transformation Jutsu
to change yourself, didn't you?!

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.280
It's you!

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:58.820
You're Kakashi Sensei, I say.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.450
You smell like Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.620
The smell of an old guy!

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.290
Why you--!

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.860
Hey! For the time being,
let's try undoing the Jutsu.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.830
If we do that,
only the two will remain... so...

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.830
You should've realized that sooner,
you idiot!

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.070
You're me, you idiot!
Just undo the Jutsu!

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:26.810
Naruto...

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.450
You're embarrassing to watch...

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.780
That was the Substitution Jutsu,
you fool.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.350
Essentially, it's a skill used
to quickly switch one's own body

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.450
with an object or animal.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.860
This makes your enemy think
you're being attacked,

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.090
but then you strike during
their unguarded moment.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.200
After letting himself get caught
by the real Naruto,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.940
the Jonin fool switched bodies
with one of the clone Narutos.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.800
Not only did he make Naruto
think he'd been nailed...

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.740
he used Naruto's own attack on him.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.280
A bell?!

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.690
You really must have been in a hurry.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.350
You've dropped a bell!

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.030
What the heck is this?!

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.770
Of course it's a trap...

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.900
H-H-Hey!

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:30.840
That jonin doesn't lower his guard
even when he's fighting Naruto.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.110
The bell!

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.820
You have to think when using Jutsu.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.820
They can be used against you.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:45.790
Also...

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.290
...don't get caught in
an obvious trap, you fool.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.900
A Ninja must see
through deception!

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.900
I know that, I say!

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.040
You know, I'm telling you
because you don't get it.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.070
Listen up!

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.410
Your movements are wasteful.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.980
Now!

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.480
He finally dropped his guard!

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.150
You're so...

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.490
No way!

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.130
You jerk Sasuke!

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.830
You're overdoing it!

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.370
Darn it!

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.130
At this rate, there's no way
I can beat Kakashi Sensei.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.540
But if I don't take the bell...

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.340
I won't get lunch...

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:15.670
No... I'll fail the test!

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:18.780
He says a Ninja must see
through deception,

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.710
but I have no idea what that means.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.810
How in the world can I take
the bell back

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.810
from Kakashi Sensei?!

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.820
Next episode:
 "You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision"

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.520
Don't miss my outstanding performance!
