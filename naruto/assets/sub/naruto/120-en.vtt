WEBVTT

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.270
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.100
Yahoo!

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.890
Roar and Howl!
The Ultimate Tag-Team!

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900
Got you!

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.890
Damn!

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.350
What’s going on?!

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.600
I felt a response to my attack,
but it didn’t work.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940
And where did his attack
come from?

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.020
Listen, Akamaru.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.100
We’re gonna attack from both sides
with Fang Over Fang.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.230
Here we go!

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.900
Fang Over Fang!

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.600
Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.850
This doesn’t look so good.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100
I’ll play a melody of death for you.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.440
What’s with this guy?

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.480
What?!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.940
Two on two is perfect,
right, Sakon?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.900
How could the Sound Ninja Four
take so much time?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.690
Did they send such strong people
after them who could hold them up…

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.310
or are they playing around too much?

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.060
Well, the one that’s probably
delaying things is…

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.060
either Jirobo who gets hungry a lot,
or Kidomaru who likes to play.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.350
But the one that’s
the most dangerous

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.020
when he loses his temper
is Sakon.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.560
He’s not satisfied until
he kills his opponent,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.600
even though he should
just leave things be.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.890
He thinks he’s the strongest of
the four, so he shows off.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.480
I wonder if that’s so…

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.440
Tayuya has a personality that’s
neck and neck with Sakon.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.310
But in any case,
nothing bad will happen

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.400
since we sent that kid…

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.480
Kimimaro.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.890
He’ll surely clean up anything that is
not good for me.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.600
I will never let you take Sasuke!

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.270
There’s a lot of trash scattered about.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.480
But after all, trash is trash.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.020
It simply needs to be cleaned up.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.890
Shut up!

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.810
Come on.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.890
I’ll crush you!

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.020
So this is the so-called
melody of death.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.440
So she’s manipulating them
with the sound of the flute.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.560
Damn! She’s getting
further and further away.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.230
What should I do?!
What is it that I should do?!

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.350
Huh?!

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.560
This is really looking bad!

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.890
Akamaru!

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.400
Oh, so you’re the real one!

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.560
Multiple Fists Barrage!

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.850
One more!

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.690
My brother and I get along very well.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.480
Usually, my older brother Ukon
sleeps inside of me,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.350
but when there’s a fight
he comes out and helps out.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.650
This is this guy’s ability.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.770
Ukon can stick out
his arms and legs, his head,

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.230
from anywhere in my body
and attacks or defends.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.810
Like this you see…

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.150
Multiple Legs Barrage!

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.900
It’s a three-legged kick.
Works well, doesn’t it?

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.560
So next, it’s…!

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.560
There’s no time to waste, Sakon.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.060
We’ll finish this quickly!
Get into the second state!

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.890
All right, all right…

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.350
You’re too impatient, bro.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.600
I see, you’re saying those horns
aren’t just for display, huh?

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.890
As soon as that right one came out,

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.270
his Chakra increased
by several tenfold.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.900
Shoot!

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.730
It seemed hopeless before,
but now it’s really bad.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.980
What’s your liking, bro?

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.440
In pieces.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.600
So now,
perhaps it’s time to get serious.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.440
I’ll take care of you all at once.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.890
Such confident words!
But those are my lines!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.560
Shoot! These guys are persistent!

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.230
But it’s starting to
get clearer to me.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.310
But the problem is
from here on out.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.850
Damn! Am I completely out of hands?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.270
What?! You’re saying
we’re gonna do that?!

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.890
No, Akamaru!

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.270
It’s too dangerous to do it here
without our comrades!

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.150
You understand, don't you?

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.480
If we use that Jutsu,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.890
both you and I will use up
most of our Chakra

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.310
and won’t be able to move.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.560
If we miss, we’ll die here in vain.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.890
Akamaru…

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.890
What a pitiful master I am…
that you had to bite me.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.980
I understand, Akamaru.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.310
Just like you said,
we only have that left!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.400
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:45.890
Now, Akamaru!

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:47.310
What?!

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.940
Do it well…Akamaru!

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.230
Show them the results of the training!

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.890
It’s Dynamic Marking!

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.020
Playing dirty like that!

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.600
All preparations are done!

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.890
Inuzuka-Style!
Man-Beast Transformation Combo!

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.890
Two-Headed Wolf!

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.730
I wondered what it was going
to be and

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.890
it turned out to be
a drooling runt of a dog.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.190
What can a dog like this do?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.150
Take this!

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.270
Drool?!

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.150
Sakon, what’re you doing!
To the right!

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.310
Damn!

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.190
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.890
Heh! How’s that!

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.890
Wolf Fang Over Fang revolution speed
is too fast.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.980
It’s such an intense high revolution that
even our visibility becomes zero.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.770
Even without direct contact,
flesh is cut…

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:26.850
A direct hit from the blow
and you’re in pieces.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.980
Really…getting carried away…

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.890
This is perfect.
We were just thinking of separating soon.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.900
What?! He divided into two people?!

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.190
It’s true…

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.600
Had we fully received the blow as one,
it would’ve been bad, but…

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.730
The real battle begins now.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.270
Damn it…

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.890
Yeah… I know Akamaru.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.150
One more shot of
Wolf Fang Over Fang.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.400
The next one is our limit.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.600
We’ll take them down with this!

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.600
Wolf Fang Over Fang!

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.020
It’s no use hiding!

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.850
I told you we don’t chase
with our eyes!

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.350
We attack by chasing smells
we’ve marked with our noses!

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.650
– A! 					– Un!

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.060
– Summoning… 					– Summoning…

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:57.890
– Rashomon! 					– Rashomon!

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:14.270
That’s an impressive power…

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.100
To turn Rashomon,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.980
the ultimate shield to protect
Lord Orochimaru into this shape.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.350
But…

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.890
– This is the end!
– This is the end!

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.480
Akamaru!

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.060
Akamaru…
To protect me, you…

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.730
Damn! He did it again!

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:47.480
My eyes…!

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.440
Damn!

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.270
Damn…!
This time it’s not ordinary piss!

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.770
It feels like my eyes are burning
with strong acid!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.690
Where’s the other one?!

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.440
Hey…

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.060
Who are you looking for?

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.600
I’ll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.890
This is my ability…
specialized in assassination, of course.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.890
You can’t beat me by
just having a good nose and nails.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.850
You can’t beat my ability!

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.890
You know that the Chakra Network
through which Chakra flows

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.690
is deeply interwoven with each
internal organ, right?

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.020
The Chakra Network is interwoven
in a variety of complicated ways

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.690
and is linked to the tissues that
make up each organ.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.190
Also to each cell that makes up
the tissues,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.890
as well as even to proteins,
which are the main component of cells…

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.890
At the second state,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.400
I can dismantle or reconstruct these cells
or proteins as I wish by using Chakra.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.350
To put it simply,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.850
I can turn my body into tiny pieces,
enter my opponent’s body…

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.190
return to my original form
and come back out.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:11.940
Akamaru…

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.900
I’m sorry… Akamaru…!

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.150
We’ve always done things together…

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.560
we were together,
always and everywhere.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.150
Yahoo! Good boy, Akamaru!

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:37.730
Yahoo! We’re lucky that the people
who got into our trap had Earth Scroll!

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.890
With our luck like this,
we’ll reach the goal first.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.810
Akamaru is frightened
all of a sudden.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.890
He can smell the strength of
an oppoenent’s Chakra.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.060
I’ve never seen him this scared…

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.150
The people fighting over there must
be something..

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.230
The Seventh Round Battle.
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.890
Hey! First of all, don’t you bring
a puppy in here!

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.440
He’ll get in the way of our battle!

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.560
Idiot! Akamaru is fighting along with me!

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.890
Now then…

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.560
Let’s go, Akamaru!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.270
Eat this!

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:42.770
There!

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:49.350
Naruto… I'm taking Akamaru back.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.520
Wh-What?! What did you feed him?
His coating has changed to red!

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.310
That’s why his name is Akamaru.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.730
Let’s go, Akamaru!

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.730
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art:

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.900
Man- Beast Clone!

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.900
Let’s go! All-Four….

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.350
Jutsu!

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.890
An opening!

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.690
Take this!
Man-Beast Ultimate Taijutsu!

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.890
Fang Over Fang!

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.690
Akamaru!

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.150
Here, Food Pills.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.150
Akamaru! Human Mimicry Ninja Art!

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:05.310
Fang Over Fang!

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.350
However, this one time,
I’m sunk…

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.890
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.730
and I can even create parts
that are only you.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.480
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.020
A sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.890
A sharing?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.310
That’s right…and a cruel way
of killing that only I can accomplish…

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.890
The gradual scraping away
of just your cells.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.480
I see.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.310
If that’s the case…!

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.890
If I do this, what’s gonna happen?

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.890
Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.100
Die with me…

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.020
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:32.150
And you smiled

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.810
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.560
In my own words

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.100
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.770
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:54.350
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.020
You listened without turning away

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.310
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:13.400
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:16.650
I feel so sad

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.600
But…

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.940
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.980
And you smiled

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.890
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.890
In my own words

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.350
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.600
And you smiled

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.020
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.980
In my own words

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.770
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.440
What is this guy?
Kekkei Genkai?!

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.890
Damn it! I've never heard
or seen this kind of technique!

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.890
Despite the fact that
this many are attacking him,

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.890
my attacks don't even faze him!

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.900
I don't know if it's
the "Five Dances" or what,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.900
but I'll take care of them all!

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.810
Next time: "To Each His Own Battle"
