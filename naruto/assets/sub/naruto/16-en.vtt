WEBVTT

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.690
C'mon!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.630
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.310
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.980
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
For no single one,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.460
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.730
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.370
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.340
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.810
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.890
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.590
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.600
Rockin' my heart

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.590
This is good!

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.100
Bit by bit,
I'm figuring out the timing...

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.670
He read my movement.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.040
No way could he do that!

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.610
Darn! 					We were so close...!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.250
Naruto, can you still move?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.680
Of course! I'm totally fine!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.590
He's pretty much spent...
and it's no wonder.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.720
Shadow Clone Jutsu uses
a lot of Chakra.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.660
But thanks to him,
 we found our way out.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.000
I found the way to break through!

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.600
Hah! Impossible!

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.640
That was just a coincidence.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.740
Naruto! Run!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.250
Run out of here and
attack from the outside!

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.020
A-All right!

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.420
You won't be able to…!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
I-I'm not going to lose!

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.500
There!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.540
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.300
Darn!

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.700
T-That was good just now!

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:45.570
What?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.870
We're doing it one more time!

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.540
All right!

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.150
It's likely that there's a limit
to that guy's Chakra, too!

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.580
To prove that,
he's little by little…

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.630
This won't go as you've planned.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.600
First, I'll get you!

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.340
Sasuke!

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.080
Darn! It's been a while since
I've fought in such bad conditions.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.590
And I'm worried about
Sasuke and Naruto, too...

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.000
Be calm…Think...
What will he come after?

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.500
Oh no!

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.080
What?!

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.520
Too late!

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.870
The Broken Seal

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.570
That was Sakura's voice!

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.570
Did something happen?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.780
What's that Kakashi doing?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.580
Sa…kura…

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.350
Darn it… I must do something…

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.630
I'll do something about it…

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.430
T-This guy...

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.600
Here I go…

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.430
It's pointless to struggle.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.290
Naruto, behind you!!

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.090
Naruto!

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.400
It's impossible for you
to get out of here.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.660
I mean it.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.830
Can you stand up, Naruto?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.800
Y-Yeah…

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.870
From now on,
don't waste your Chakra!

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.810
You're playing right into his hands.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.510
I know.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.150
Darn it!

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.350
If things continue like this,
it's going to be really bad.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.650
I...

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.620
I have to do something.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.790
Strangely, my eyes have adjusted…

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.130
It's about the time I put
an end to this for you…

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.830
What?!

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.240
Stand up, you idiot!

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.480
I'm aiming for a vital spot...
but he's parrying all of them .

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.850
I know…
you're so persistent!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.400
A coincidence…
No, that's not it.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.930
On the contrary, he's fighting
while covering for his friend.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.940
Surely, my movements…

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.410
That boy…he can see something.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.280
What in the world...?

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.920
Okay, in that case...

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.390
He disappeared.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.590
Where, where did he disappear to?!

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.390
Naruto! Don't faint!

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.390
I can't take care of you
any more than I am now!

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.400
Who asked you to take care of me...

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.800
It seems that kid has
reached his limits.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.710
Tsk...

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.050
Amazing…
That's an amazing move.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.080
You move well…

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.590
Wha--?!

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.460
But I'll stop you
with the next one.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.960
Motor function...

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.130
Reflexes...
Ability to judge a situation...

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.340
All of these things…
should be at their limits!

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.570
He's coming!

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.840
Calm down…

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.340
Focus!

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.680
And … 					See everything!

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.260
He saw through absolutely everything?!

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.600
No way…

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.510
Those eyes…

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.280
It can't be…

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.680
Sharingan…

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.790
You are…

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.860
Only a little, but...

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.430
I was able to see!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.300
So, you also have the power
of Kekkei Genkai…

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.570
What a kid…

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.700
It's not perfect yet,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.810
but to think that in the middle of a battle
he was able to rouse this power…

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.580
If that's the case,
I can't fight him too long…

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.080
This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.590
There are also limits to retaining
the teleportation speed.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.930
Besides, the longer the fight continues,

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.600
the more my movements will enter
into the range of his "reading."

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.570
In fact, his eyes
have already captured me.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.810
It would be foolish to aim
straight at him.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.140
In that case…

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.220
I'll use that kid to lure him in!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.590
What?!

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.220
Let me make it in time!

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.440
K-Kakashi Sensei!

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.040
You were late entering
to guard, Kakashi.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.010
Your whole-hearted intent to help
those kids has gone to your head,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.580
and it seems to have clouded
your Sharingan

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.350
with even heavier fog.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.390
Even though you have
those impressive eyes,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.720
your ability to read your enemy's
movements is getting cloudy.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.130
Amuse me more, Kakashi…

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.200
I want to repay my debt in
an amusing way.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:37.980
Don't worry. Anytime now,
Haku is going to defeat those kids.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:49.020
You better apologize to them
in tears

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.220
when you are in "the next world"
for your lack of strength.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.960
Sasuke will be defeated…?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.230
That's not true!

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.230
Sasuke is…

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.600
Cha!

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.770
Not by that guy!

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.800
Cha!

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.640
He won't be defeated!

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.440
Cha!

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.640
Naruto won't either!

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.910
That's right.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.780
Huh!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:55.450
I...believe in their strength.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.390
Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja…

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.330
And Sasuke is a member of
the most excellent clan

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.770
in the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.500
That can't be!

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.870
Yes…
His name is Sasuke Uchiha…

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.580
He bears within his body...

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.180
the famous Kekkei Genkai
of the Uchiha clan!

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.580
He's a Ninja genius.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:32.190
He's the remaining survivor
of that tragic clan?!

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.100
No wonder he grows so quickly.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.570
But...

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.940
That's the same as Haku.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.650
Nobody has ever beaten
that secret Jutsu of Haku's

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.680
Not one person in the past…

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.090
Well then…

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.220
It's about time I settled this too, huh.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.660
Sakura, don't move from here.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.530
Uh... ah…okay!

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.570
No, I'm going to put
an end to this!

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.780
For God's sake, you…

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.960
just won't quit…
dragging my feet, will you?

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.060
You did it! 					Sasuke...!

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.170
W-What kind of expression
is that…

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.180
You…idiot…!

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.580
W-Why?!

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.590
You protected me…?!

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:16.290
How the hell…should I know?

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.590
Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.160
Hmph…

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.160
You...

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.900
I hated you…

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.300
Why? Why…?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.540
Why…me…?

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.680
I didn't ask for your help!!

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.920
I don't know…

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.660
My body moved…of its own accord…

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:25.600
Fool…!

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.880
Sasuke!

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:43.580
That man…

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.250
Until I defeated…my brother…

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.930
I absolutely refused to die...

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.590
That's what I decided, but...

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.340
You, don't die…

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.570
He…

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.390
To protect someone dear to him…

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.960
he would plunge in
knowing it was a trap…

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.600
He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.700
Is this the first time you faced
a friend's death?

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.640
This is the way of the Shinobi…

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.580
Shut up!

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.590
Even though I...
hated you too…

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.040
I won't forgive you…

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:08.760
I'm going to kill you!

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.000
What is this Chakra?!

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:25.640
It can't be…

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.180
For Chakras to be tangible like that…

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.090
A-And…what a ghastly Chakra that is…

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.170
The wound on his hand…
lt's healing instantly…

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.170
This boy…

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.340
Who in hell is he…?

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.950
Is it Zabuza…?

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.360
No!

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.790
This sinister Chakra was once…

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.460
It can't be!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.030
What is…this Chakra?

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.330
It feels foul…

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.510
Kakashi?
No, it's too big to be Kakashi's…

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840
Who is it?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:34.580
Naruto…!

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.020
Oh no…

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.590
At the time like this…

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.290
The seal has broken…?

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.460
I have to hurry!

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.630
He's coming!

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.570
How dare you!

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:15.870
You ruined Sasuke!
Damn you!

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.580
Sasuke's dream…

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.980
What about dream?!

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.520
Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.590
Because of your dream…!

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.590
