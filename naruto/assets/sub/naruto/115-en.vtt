00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.080
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.990
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.290
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.450
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.620
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.160
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.040
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.160
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.330
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.000
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.410
It’s close.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.910
That’s strange.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.160
There hasn’t been even
one trap set for a while…

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.200
Shikamaru, what do you think?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.790
We’re being underestimated.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.410
Those guys think the only one
following them is that big guy.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.990
They don’t need to set
a trap on their man.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.040
How dare they underestimate us!

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.870
It seems you’re right.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.620
We are being
completely  underestimated.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.990
However, this is our chance.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.990
Yeah… We’ll take them by surprise.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.080
Your Opponent is Me!

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.790
That Jirobo is late.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.990
No, he’s already here.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.990
Aw, c’mon, what took you so long?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.990
Sorry.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.160
It took time to eat the scums’ Chakra.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.750
Hey fatso, don’t you dare drag!

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.700
Hurry up and carry that coffin…

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.830
That’s your job, you vulgar swine.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000
I know.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.120
What, Jirobo…
You’re awfully easygoing today.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.540
What do you mean?

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.750
I’m just saying I’m not handing you
the coffin.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.120
Because you’re not Jirobo!

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.790
This time let me do it.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
Sakon, Tayuya, you guys go ahead!

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.540
Jirobo always corrects
Tayuya’s choice of words.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.370
Heh, I see.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.950
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.990
You!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.870
Ninja Art: Spiral Spider Web

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.450
Naruto!

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.910
Now Kiba, Akamaru!

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.410
He shouldn’t be able to
move in mid-air.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.200
Fang Over Fang!

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.790
I won’t let you get away!

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.990
That’s my line.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.330
Look at your feet.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.660
You!

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.990
It’s too soon for you to think
you captured us with a thing like this!

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.830
Shut up!

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.160
C’mon, what the hell is
that fatso doing, dammit!

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.660
It was a mistake to leave
behind the weakest of us, after all.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.540
Got it.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.540
– Neji! 					– What?!

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.250
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji…

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.950
Even though we’ve followed the plan,
it’s no good.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.540
I’m going to cocoon you.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.620
Damn!

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.040
Damn it! Damn it!

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.540
What’s with this thread?! It won’t cut.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.410
It’s useless.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.990
My thread is so strong that
even if two elephants pulled away,

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.990
it wouldn’t break.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.410
Shadow Clone… Interesting.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.500
The thread is sticking…

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.750
This stickiness is probably made

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.370
by mixing Chakra with
his special body fluid.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.990
Moreover, this strength. Even after
it’s been released from his hands…

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.620
Chakra’s continuously flowing
in the thread.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.790
It’s impossible…
The level of the Jutsu is unrealistic.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.750
Calm down… Just calm down…

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.540
my Chakra.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.290
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.830
It’s a different color than
the thread from before.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:34.790
What’s he gonna do?

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.830
It’s quickly solidifying, huh…

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.790
You are the first one,
so it’s like a little entertainment.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.000
Now I’ll play a game to see
which of you is the real one.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.660
What did you say?!

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.250
First is…you at the end.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.950
Naruto!

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.450
It was a clone, huh.
Well, this one next!

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.330
What a lucky guy.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.080
Next, I’ll do two at a time.
The odds are 2 to 1.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:48.040
This guy has a great luck,
but it's either one or the other now!

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.700
Turns out he made it to the last.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:09.790
Well, it was fun as a game,
but now the game’s over.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.990
Die!

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.330
The first one is done.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.910
What?!

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.080
I see, the real body made
its shadow clones get caught,

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.540
and hid himself and
waited for a chance, huh.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.750
For a small fish like that to make
such a plan in those circumstances...

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.750
You're not too bad…but …

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.370
You’re at the end of the line. Die!

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:05.990
What?!

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.160
Naruto, your stall was helpful.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.370
Neji!

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.990
You… How…?!

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.990
Substance with Chakra base…

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.990
It’s meaningless in front
of Gentle Fist

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.410
that destroys by pouring
Chakra through.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.250
That guy’s Jutsu…

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.950
Evidently I’m the only one
who can fight it.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.990
Go!

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.000
I’ll take care of this.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.620
What’s wrong? Hey, Akamaru.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.540
Apparently, this guy’s stronger
than the fatso before.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.410
Quite a bit stronger.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.200
If we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.790
then it’s not going to work out.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.160
That’s what you said earlier.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.080
Yeah, that’s right.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.830
Plus, we won’t be able to catch up
with Sasuke if we stall here.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.990
Choji hasn’t come back either.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.870
The reason we’re doing this

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.160
is because of the mission
to bring back Sasuke.

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.990
But that’s not all.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:56.120
What we are after and trying
to protect is the bond

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.990
of the Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.160
Do you remember Iruka’s words
at the Third Hokage’s funeral?

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:21.450
Iruka Sensei, why do people risk
their lives for others?

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.620
When someone dies,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.080
they depart with their past,
present and future.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.370
Many people die on missions
or at war.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:42.990
And their death is surprisingly
unceremonious…they simply die.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.990
Hayate was one of those people.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.910
Those who die have dreams
and goals, too…

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.160
But everyone has things that
are equally important.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.200
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers,
the people of their village,

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.250
the people important to you.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.200
The connection to the people
you trust and help mutually,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.790
the people important to you
from the day you were born.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.410
And the thread that
connects you and your people

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.580
gets stronger through time.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.830
It’s not a theory.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.120
That’s what a person does
as the thread is established

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.700
because they’re important to you…

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.250
Look, Sasuke is heading
towards Orochimaru.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.990
We can’t let Orochimaru get
a hold of someone from our village.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.660
Absolutely not.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:51.990
And…

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.080
Naruto…

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.160
Your eyes are better than mine.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.870
Right now, Sasuke is…

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.990
in the darkness.

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.540
Hurry up and go!
I’ll catch up with you all!

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.950
Gotcha!

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:47.410
Okay! Let’s go!

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.990
You along with Choji,
be sure to catch up!

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.700
Yeah…

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.250
Neji, be absolutely sure to catch up!

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.580
Heh…think I’ll let them get away?!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.830
Byakugan!

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.990
Here it comes!

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.540
This guy’s pretty good…

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.410
Neji!

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.990
That’s Neji all right!

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.250
Not yet…
I won’t let you escape that easily!

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.700
I won’t let you go any further from here!

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.290
It’s useless.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.790
Well, that’s fine.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.450
It seems you’re the strongest
out of the lot.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.200
Aw man, now I wanna play…

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.870
It’s such a waste if
a game isn't played little by little.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.620
For starters,
I’ll play and kill you in three minutes.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.200
I got you.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.990
You’re pretty good at handling Chakra
and you’ve got sharp eyes.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.830
You release Chakra from
the Chakra points in your hands

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.540
like a sharp needle.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.580
You see the thin part of the thread
with Chakra running through it, and attack.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.410
I see, I’ve heard from Lord Orochimaru…

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.990
This is what’s called Gentle Fist, isn’t it?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.830
But if you can’t use
those annoying hands,

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.120
they can’t cut my threads either.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.990
Man, games. The instant you know
the rules of engagement,

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.450
they’re no longer interesting.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.660
It’s only been a minute,
but I’m already tired of you.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.660
Die!

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.870
Ninja Art:
Gum Style Spider Thread

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.120
What?!

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.990
How did he…?!

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.660
I’ll explain, specially to you.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.000
It’s not just my hands

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:58.200
I can release Chakra from
all of the Chakra points on my body.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.700
And it’s game over.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.990
Gentle Fist: 8 trigrams 64 palms.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:32.660
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.250
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:43.540
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:53.910
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:59.410
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.450
Look like a mountain

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.120
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.990
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.290
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.540
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.870
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.990
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.620
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:46.950
Look like a mountain

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.830
The attack on his Chakra points
is ineffective.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:54.700
On top of that,

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.200
he switched to a long-distance attack
to avoid Gentle Fist.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.950
This guy blocks my every move
and he quickly reads my hands.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.990
This is bad. I’m at a disadvantage
if the fight drags on.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.250
And if he noticed that, then…

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.990

The Byakugan’s Blind Spot!”
