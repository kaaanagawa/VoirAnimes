WEBVTT

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.060
C'mon!

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.000
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.270
Being chased by something

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.670
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.340
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.080
For no single one,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.880
To none does belong,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.720
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.090
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.900
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.400
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.770
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.740
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.170
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.750
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.250
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.890
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.900
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.970
Rockin' my heart

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.020
Inari! Give me a hand.
21	02:16:45:14	02:16:46:22
I'll be right there.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.870
This mist…

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.170
Sasuke! Sakura! They're coming!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.580
I knew he was still alive.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.880
Making an appearance so soon, eh…

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.880
Say, Kakashi Sensei.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.890
This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.900
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.500
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.040
He's still trembling. Poor thing.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.450
I'm trembling with…excitement.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.320
Do it, Sasuke.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.230
I can see him!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.570
Well, well.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.440
So you discerned
the Water Doppelganger Jutsu.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.470
That brat's grown quite a bit.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.840
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.710
So it seems.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.800
Damn it!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.600
I'm totally late!

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.890
Well, well… It seems my prediction
was right on the money.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.090
Prediction?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.890
That little mask...

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.960
Oh!

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.960
I knew it… Heh!

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.230
So the Elite Shinobi of
the Hidden Mist thing

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.870
was a bald-faced lie!

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.940
No matter how you look at him,
he's gotta be a comrade of Zabuza.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.270
Standing together with him and all…

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.340
How dare he show up like that
after what he did!

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.880
I hate brats who think they're so cool…

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.520
He's better than you, Kakashi Sensei.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.180
Oh…really?

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.890
I'll do it.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.890
Huh?

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.290
With his bad acting…
I hate brats who think they're so cool!

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.700
Sasuke, you are so cool!

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.900
That Sakura doesn't take stabs at Sasuke…

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.000
He's an impressive youth.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.340
Hmm...

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.670
Even though those Water Clones

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.380
have only 1/10th the strength
of their original...

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.880
To think he went that well.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.980
However, you made
the preemptive move.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.690
Go!

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.020
Right!

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.560
What?!

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.610
Haku's Secret Jutsu:
Crystal Ice Mirrors

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.720
Are you Tazuna's daughter?

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.590
Sorry, but you're coming with us.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.400
Mom!

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.010
Don't come out!
Get out of here, quick!

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.880
What's with you, brat?!

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.880
Shall we take him, too?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.550
One hostage is fine.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.890
Hostage…?!

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.090
Then...

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.420
Shall we kill him?

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.900
Wait!

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.800
If you lay a hand on that child…

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.870
I'll bite off my tongue
and kill myself!

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.450
You want a hostage, right?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.790
Thank your mom, kid.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.270
Oh, man… 					lt's not enough…

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.870
Knock it off.
You just tried out your sword earlier.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.540
Forget it already and
let's take the woman.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.890
Mom, I'm sorry...

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.720
I'm so sorry!

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.530
I'm weak, so I can't protect you…

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.540
I don't want to die…
I'm scared!

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.980
You crybaby…

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.050
So you're just gonna cry all day
like the lead in a tragedy?

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.250
An idiot like you can just
cry forever! You crybaby!

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.860
He's probably tired of crying.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.630
So, he knows the true meaning of
the word strong.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.130
Like your father.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.240
For the things I truly hold
dear to myself…

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.710
I protect them until the end
with both these arms,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.080
even if it looks like I might lose my life!

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.720
Inari…

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.930
Can I…

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.930
can I also become strong…?

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.810
Dad!

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.250
Looking at that beautiful skin
of yours makes me want to cut you.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.350
Hey…walk faster.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.850
Wait!

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:06.920
Inari!

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.430
What? It's just the kid from before.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.130
Get…get away from my mom!

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.970
Man…This brat's hopeless.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.510
Let's do it!

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.610
If you do that, I'll bite off
my tongue and--

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.080
Shut up. Go to sleep.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.880
I…na…ri.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.260
Well, well…
He can see that speed, eh…

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.900
Yes…

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.600
Sakura, surround Tazuna and
don't move away from me.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.870
Let Sasuke handle him!

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.540
Okay.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.950
I don't want to have to kill you…

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.250
I'd like for you to back down.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.520
Nonsense…

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.360
I knew it…

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.230
But you won't be able to keep up
 with my speed.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.800
Also, I've already made
two preemptive moves.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.270
Two preemptive moves?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.640
The first one is the scattered water.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.450
And the second one was
blocking one of your hands…

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.680
Therefore, you'll just be able
to defend my attack…

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.050
What?! With one hand he's…?!

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.890
A one-handed Sign?

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.430
I've never seen such a thing before…

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.900
A Thousand Needles of Death!

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.480
So he doesn't want to kill him…eh.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.980
I wonder if that's how he really feels…

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.080
Sasuke!

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.090
Remember…that training…

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.760
Build up Chakra at one burst…

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.880
The Substitution Jutsu…?!

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.890
The woman… Hmm?

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.920
Sorry I was late.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.900
Heroes usually appear
on the scene late, so…

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.030
Naruto…!

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.640
Inari, you did well!

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.470
Huh?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.540
Thanks to you distracting them,
I was able to save your mom.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.490
Naruto…how did you know that
those samurai were here?

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.760
In the forest, there was a boar that
had been cut-up with a sword.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.530
Other than that,
there were trees with lots of cuts.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.800
They headed in
the direction of your house…

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.400
so I got worried.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.270
I see.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.870
Well…

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.010
If it isn't the no-good Ninja
that Tazuna hired…

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.440
Let's do it…

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.210
Yeah…

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:47.880
Here they come!

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.890
Hah! Something like that won't work!

00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:59.890
Fools.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.730
Prepare yourself!

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.880
W-Wow…!

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.950
It's done!

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.990
Naruto, you're just like... a Ninja!

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.190
You fool.
I was a Ninja to start with!

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.540
Build up Chakra at one burst…

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.110
to the feet!

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
He vanished…

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.900
You're surprisingly stupid…

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.140
From here on…
you'll only defend my attack!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.350
To think Haku would
lose in speed…

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.530
It seems that I'm faster than you…

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.600
I can't have you mocking our team,
calling them brats…

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:52.000
He may not look it,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.240
but Sasuke is the number one rookie
of the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.540
And Sakura is our sharpest…

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.880
Hah! Serves you right!

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.020
And the other one is
the number one hyperactive,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.390
knucklehead Ninja, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760
You have a cold?

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.300
I'm okay.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.670
Anyway...
Sorry about yesterday, Inari.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:27.870
Huh?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:35.080
Branding you a crybaby…
Forget I ever said that.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.250
You're strong!

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:49.890
Dang it!

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.530
I…decided never
to cry again, but…

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:04.170
Now you'll laugh at me again
and call me a crybaby.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.940
What're you saying…?!

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.950
It's okay…when you're happy.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.030
It's okay to cry when you're happy!

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.260
Naruto…

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.880
Now then.
I can leave the rest to you, right?

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:40.880
Yeah…

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.720
Okay, I'm going to hop over
to the bridge for a bit.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.890
Man, it's tough being a hero!
That's for sure!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.870
Haku, do you know what this means?

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.140
At this rate, you'll be defeated
by your intended victim…

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:09.810
Yes…

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.880
What…?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.980
It's unfortunate…

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.890
Is this…cold air…?

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.770
Hidden Jutsu!

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.720
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.500
What is it? What's that Jutsu?

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.920
Are these…mirrors?!

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:33.920
What…

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.430
in the world…?!

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:38.900
Damn it!

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.870
I'm your opponent, aren't I?

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:52.040
Since that Jutsu has appeared…
he's done for.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.450
Now then…I'll start.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.890
I shall show you...
my true speed!

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:08.930
Sasuke!

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.730
Sasuke!

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.690
If you make a move,
I'll kill those two!!

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.870
I'm sorry, Tazuna!

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.040
I'm stepping away from here for a bit.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.880
Sure. Go!

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.650
Sakura!

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:05.480
Sasuke!

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.690
Take this!

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.540
He caught it?!

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:45.990
What?!

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.900
Who is it?!

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:02.910
It's that idiot…that showoff…

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:09.380
The number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja…

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.460
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.600
is finally here!

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.330
Naruto Uzumaki is finally here!

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.670
It'll be okay.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.870
Now that the hero of the story
has appeared,

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.970
I'll smash those stupid
funny-looking mirrors in no time…

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.180
Huh? Why won't mirrors
made of ice break?

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.880
Why won't they melt?

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:26.750
What the heck is going on here?!

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.890
Next episode:
"The Number One Hyperactive
		 Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!"

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.890
As for me, will I be able
to kick butt once again?
