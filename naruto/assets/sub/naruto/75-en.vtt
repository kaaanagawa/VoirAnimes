WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.260
One more time

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
Are you really happy

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.890
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.760
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.840
Sasuke's Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.050
There you are!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.050
I’m here!

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.050
I’m returning them to you!

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.550
So it’s a clone…

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.430
Bastard!

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.390
Sasuke…Uchiha…!

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.350
Why won’t you come at me?!

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.800
Why…

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.510
do you flee?!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.840
Ready?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.140
Over here!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.010
Over here!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.510
Wait!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.840
Pass!

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.600
Here! Good one!

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.140
Good! Go! Go! Go!

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.760
Power shot!

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.840
What’re we gonna do?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.100
We don’t know any wall-climbing
techniques or anything…

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.600
Y-You’re…

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.350
This…

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.800
It’s Gaara…

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.760
Gaara of Sand…

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.800
R-Run!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.010
Wait!

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.840
Don’t leave me alone!

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.840
Help me!

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.600
I don't…

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.600
want to be alone anymore!

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.840
Really…

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.550
No!

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.720
Gaara! Please calm down!

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.350
Yashamaru…

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.680
No escape!

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.890
I won’t let you escape!
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.350
You’ve gotta be kidding!
What’s with that outrageous strength…?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.840
Are you afraid of me?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.300
It’s too overwhelming…

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:43.180
Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of my existence?!

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.840
Don’t forget…
You are my prey.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.430
Wait!

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.010
Why are you fixated
on me so much?

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.840
Those eyes that know true loneliness…

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.300
And eyes that know that
it is the world’s greatest suffering…

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.100
I think I told you.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.890
That you have the same eyes as me.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.430
Eyes that lust for power,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.840
overflowing with hatred
and murderous intent…

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.800
The same as me…

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.510
Eyes that burn to kill those
who drove you…

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.050
into a hell called loneliness!

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.840
Such are your eyes.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.510
Okay. Just a minute.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.840
So you’re called Gaara…

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.930
I don’t know what you know
about Sasuke, but…

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:14.800
It’s not good for you to
speak as though

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.840
you perceive everything about Sasuke!

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.720
What is it that you want to say
to him before the final round,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.510
by pursuing him so far?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.930
A battle is where…

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.970
another’s existence and one’s own
existence are put on the line…

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.840
and each tries to kill the other!

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.180
Only the winner can actually feel
the value of his own existence.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.680
In other words,
what you want to say is…

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.970
let’s have a killing bout and
not a match?

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.470
Uchiha… You really should
be wanting it, too…

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.890
in the depths of your soul…

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.840
You want to confirm
the value of your existence.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.800
Am I really, truly powerful?

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.140
Is my existence more powerful
than my opponent

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.840
who faces me with eyes
filled with intent to kill?

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.680
What’s the matter?!

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.800
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.800
Are you afraid of me?!

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.760
Your hatred and intent to kill…

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.800
have they given way to fear?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.850
Is that the extent of your existence?!

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.180
Fight me…and confirm it!

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.550
Your value! Your existence!

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.640
Experience it!

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.930
If you want an answer…

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.640
Come at me!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.890
I was allowed to live…

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.350
Only…myself.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.840
Expressly for what reason?!

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.430
No… I know the reason.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.550
The reason that man left me alive
was so he wouldn’t be tormented

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.510
by a sense of guilt for having killed
an entire clan…

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:48.180
Itachi chose me as the avenger…
in order to have me kill him!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:08.600
Now, let me have some fun…
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.140
I’ll finish it with one blow!

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.100
Hurry up and die,
release yourself from your misery.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.840
You silly old fool…

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.680
I believe I told you…
that you would die too!

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.350
Bastard!

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.510
Let go, you old fool!

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.890
I will not let go!
I refuse to let go…

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.840
until I have pulled out your soul!

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.800
At this rate…

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.350
Gaara!

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.640
Looks like it worked…

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.390
I see! That’s what it was!

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600
That’s not possible…

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.600
He countered Gaara’s attack
in that condition?!

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.760
I just realized the reason…
why it’s so fun!

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.640
This pain…

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.800
To take down an opponent
who wounded me…

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.430
and thoroughly destroy him…!

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.300
That will make me truly feel alive!

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.970
Gaara’s never had a single wound,
but he got Gaara twice.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.050
Is he…a freak?!

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.180
No…a true freak is…

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.840
After all, the only thing Gaara is
transforming is still just his right arm.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.800
More, more!

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.840
What?!

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.390
What the heck is this guy?!

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.600
One after another…

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.470
Here goes!

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.050
He’s even faster!

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.970
I can’t dodge unless
I read ahead of his movements.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.350
If I didn’t have these eyes
I’d have died long ago.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.890
I can no longer use Chidori…

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.050
Fire Style…
Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.890
So the Fire Style doesn’t
work against sand…

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.720
Not only that,
this level of Jutsu won’t…

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.840
Die!

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.140
Apparently…it needs to be Chidori!

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.840
Well! Your limit is two shots.
That’s about it…

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.390
This is as many Chidori
you can shoot in one day

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.640
with your present Chakra.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.720
After all, this Chidori is a technique
that can only be used

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.840
in conjunction with Sharingan
during actual battles.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.640
But using Sharingan and
another Jutsu simultaneously means

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.260
exploding and using up the Chakra
in your body all at once.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.890
Well! But you really are
one of the more impressive ones.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.850
Even with my Chidori…

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.050
If I use the Lightning Blade
four times in a day,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.050
I’d completely use up my Chakra.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.010
What would happen if I tried
to use more than two shots?

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.220
The third shot won’t be activated…

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.390
Remember this well!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.180
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.840
not only will the Jutsu
not properly activate,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:35.840
but your Chakra will deplete to zero…

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.840
And in the worst case, you’ll die!

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.510
Even if you were to survive,
absolutely nothing good will come of it.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.180
Especially in your case.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:17:59.930
What's the matter?

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.010
Does the value of your existence
amount to only this much?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.470
I’ll be blunt…

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.840
You are…weak!

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:16.140
You’re too optimistic.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.050
And it’s because your hatred
is weak!

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.840
The power of hatred is
the power of the intent to kill!

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.850
The power of the intent to kill
is the power of revenge!

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.720
Your hatred is weaker than mine!

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.390
Shut up…

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.850
Do you understand
the meaning of this?!

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.680
Shut up!

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.100
That means that you…
You are weaker than me!

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:02.390
Itachi chose me to be the avenger…
to have me kill him!

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.100
I am an avenger!

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.890
The Curse Mark again…

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.800
Darn…! My body…

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.640
Sasuke!

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:28.180
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:39.510
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:55.180
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:00.220
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.640
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.840
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:20.930
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:31.840
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:42.390
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.930
Forge on strong

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.840
Hey Yashamaru,
what does pain feel like?

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.100
I don’t know because
I’ve never been injured…

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.050
I was wondering what it’s like.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.430
Could it be that I’m hurt?

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.100
I’m not bleeding, but my chest’s
felt weird for a long time.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.840
It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:26.760
Next time:
“Assassin of the Moonlit Night”
