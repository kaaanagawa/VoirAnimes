WEBVTT

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.760
C'mon!

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.970
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.370
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780
For no single one,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.560
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.790
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.100
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.470
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.440
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.870
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.450
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.950
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.660
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.670
Rockin' my heart

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550
Is this the first time you
have faced a friend's death?

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.590
This is the way of the Shinobi…

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.830
I won't forgive you…

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.580
I'm going to kill you!

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.850
White Past: Hidden Ambition

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.390
There's murder in his eyes!

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.860
He looks nothing like he used to!

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.590
He's coming!

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.330
What?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.270
His Chakra repelled my attack!

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.340
Then…

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.420
This should do it!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.360
Why?!

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.600
It can't be!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.370
Could... Naruto's seal
have been broken…?!

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.140
No.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.210
This feeling…

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.250
True, the seal is almost off

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.580
and the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed
Fox Spirit is escaping, but…

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.590
Fortunately, the seal is not
completely broken!

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.590
I still have some time!

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.790
Do you hear me, Zabuza?

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.900
We're both busy people.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.800
I know it's against your style,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.870
but I think it's about time
we stopped playing around.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.570
Why don't we settle this once
and for all with the next move?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.580
Interesting.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.910
What can you possibly
do in this situation?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.650
Kakashi, go ahead. 					Show me.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.590
No good…

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.890
I can't hold his aura down!

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.570
Zabuza…

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.710
I can't defeat this boy.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.590
Zabuza…

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.120
I'm…

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.590
You…from that time…

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.590
Why?

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.790
Why stop?

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.570
Even though I killed your dear friend,
you can't kill me?

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.410
Damn it!

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.760
What happened to the
force from moment ago?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.590
You can't defeat me with
that kind of strength.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.770
Wasn't he someone
special to you?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.640
Is there someone special
in your life?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.210
I want to protect someone
special to me.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.210
I want to make that
person's dream a reality…

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.510
That's my dream.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.750
Many people misunderstand.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.590
They pity and don't finish off
the enemy they ought to finish.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.960
They let them survive.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.760
To me, that isn't compassion
or anything.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.130
Do you know?

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.340
How it feels to
not be needed by anyone?

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.110
To live day to day without a dream.
The pain of it all.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.580
What are you saying?

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.420
Zabuza has no use
for a weak Shinobi.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.020
You took away
my reason for existence.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.990
Why?

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.260
Why do you have to
serve a guy like that?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.490
He gets the money from thugs
to do bad things!

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.330
Is that No-Brow
the only person special to you?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.840
A long time ago,
I had other people special to me.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.010
They were…my parents.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:27.850
I was born in the Land of Water,
in a small village heavy with snow.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.590
My parents worked on a small farm.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.660
We were very poor,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.130
but my parents seem to
be satisfied with it.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.660
I was happy then…

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.530
They were loving parents.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:46.970
But…

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.840
When I was old enough
to understand things,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.580
something happened.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.080
Something?

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.980
What happened?

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.850
My blood…

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:05.490
Blood?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:08.990
Go on!

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.600
Tell me what happened.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.330
My father…
He killed my mother.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.040
Then he tried to kill me.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.440
Huh?!

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.140
After the experience of
the ceaseless civil war,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:30.580
people with Kekkei Genkai were
hated and feared in the Land of Water.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.920
Kekkei Genkai?

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.590
It's special powers or Jutsu
passed on through certain clans,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.590
from parent to child,
or from grandparent to grandchild.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.330
Because of their special powers,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.830
those of the clans were exploited in
all sorts of battles.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.570
As a result, all Kekkei Genkai
were feared

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.340
as harbingers of disaster
and death.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.350
After the war was over,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.120
they decided to hide
their special powers.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.420
If anyone knew of their secret,
only death could be expected.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.760
I'm sure that boy went through
so much suffering as well.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.570
The greater your power,
the more you were feared.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.240
My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.480
She kept it secret from my father.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.350
She hoped that for a while…

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.180
No, she must have thought that
they could have a simple life forever.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.460
Look, Mommy! Look!

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.590
Isn't it fantastic?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.600
Not you, too!

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
Why? Why him, too?

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.600
That hurts, Mommy!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.140
Sorry…

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.710
I'm sorry, Haku…

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.550
I'm sorry!

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.050
However…

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.220
Father had discovered our secret.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.880
When I came to…

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.590
I had killed my own father.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.260
And that moment,
what I thought of myself was that…

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.600
no, that is what I had to think.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.670
And then knew that it was
the most painful thing.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.700
The most…painful thing…?

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.440
That I…

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.580
that my existence didn't matter
to anyone else in the world.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.050
Same with me.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.550
You told me that...

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.220
You'll be the best Ninja in the village,
and make everyone respect you.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.760
If someone comes along and
accepts you for who you are,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.570
no one could be more important
to you than that person.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.970
Even though he knew I was from
a clan with Kekkei Genkai,

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.580
Zabuza took me in.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.220
My power that everyone hated...
He wanted it, needed it.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:34.290
Brats like you won't be needed
by anyone and die like dogs.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.530
You have the same eyes
as I do…

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.470
Brat…

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.880
Do you want…
to be needed by someone?

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.390
Are you willing
to give everything for me?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.770
From now on,
your power belongs to me.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.150
Come with me.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.460
I was so happy…

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.590
Haku, bad news.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.930
I have to leave the Land of Water
as of tonight.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.670
However, I'll be back in
this land some day.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.710
I will rule over this land.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.410
To do that...

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.050
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.720
What I really need is…

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.950
I already know.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.590
You have nothing to fear.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.260
I am your weapon, Zabuza.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:16.590
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.600
You're a good boy!

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.770
I apologize, Zabuza.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.210
I wasn't good enough to be
the tool you were looking for.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.580
Naruto!

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.020
I want you…

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.990
to kill me.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.140
Ninja Art, Summoning,
Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.210
Whatever you do won't work!

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.080
You have absolutely no idea
where I am now.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.350
However…

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.390
I know exactly where you are
and what you're about.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.660
Kakashi…

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.100
You are completely
in my hands now.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.880
W-What is that racket?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.020
What... Just what's going on out there?

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.960
If you can't use your eyes or ears,
simply use your nose.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.890
That's what happens

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.660
when you're closing your eyes
in the midst of fog.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.100
This is the Summoning Jutsu
specialized for pursuit.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.600
I deliberately shed my own blood

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.240
to stop your attacks both times
for this.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.080
Your weapons have a thick scent of
my blood on them now.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.020
Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.250
And their sense of smell
is without equal.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.590
You're the one who
was playing into my hands.

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.590
The fog has lifted already.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.600
And your future is… 					death.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.930
I've had enough of your bluffs!

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.570
Don't act tough!

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.540
There's nothing you can do
in this situation.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.180
Your death is certain.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.510
Zabuza.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.580
You were too full of yourself.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.680
You're too ambitious
for your own good.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.000
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.570
You left the service with
few men under you,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.600
and became a Rogue Ninja.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.580
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.550
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.680
And you needed to hide from

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.580
the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.590
Isn't that about the reason

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.120
why you hired yourself out
to scum like Gato?

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.420
Zabuza.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:38.630
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.630
Here's something I didn't copy,
a Jutsu of my own…

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.140
To enlighten you!

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.850
Lightning Blade!

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.950
What the…?!

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.620
His hand is visibly overflowing
with Chakra!

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.600
You are too dangerous.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.100
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.770
is the symbol of courage in this land!

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.370
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.910
And your ambitions will sacrifice
countless lives.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.750
That isn't how a Shinobi
is supposed to behave.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.580
Who cares?

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.990
I have always fought
for my own ideals.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.760
And that will never ever change!

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:47.760
I'll say it again.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:48.930
Huh?

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.830
Give up.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.310
Your future is… 					death!

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.510
Please kill me.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.350
What are you hesitating for?

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.020
No…

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.720
What you said is ridiculous!

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.260
You're a weapon?
Just a tool for him?

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:16.590
How can you call him
special to you?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.300
Are you really okay with that?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.270
Is that wrong?

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.200
Huh?

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.570
Tell me, what is wrong with that?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:27.840
Well, uh…

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.540
It's not…

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:34.580
Zabuza counts on me,
even if I'm worthless.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.080
He made me feel needed.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.220
But now, I've lost my usefulness
that affirmed my existence.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.220
Zabuza no longer needs me.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.730
That's why,
I am now appealing to you.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.030
Please, make it quick

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.170
W-Why did this happen?

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.440
Is this what it means to
be a strong Ninja?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.580
To protect someone?

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.050
Are you okay with that?

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.080
Are you really okay with that?

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.590
I don't get it.
I can never accept that!

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.460
