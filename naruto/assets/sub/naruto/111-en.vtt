WEBVTT

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.980
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.190
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.350
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.940
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.690
Sasuke!

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.890
It will be necessary for you
to die once…

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.940
Die once, you said?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.730
Mind Awakening Pill.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.810
You will take these.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.690
Mind Awakening Pill…?
What is that?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.810
Your Curse Mark level is
at the first state…

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.890
These pills will forcibly stimulate

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.890
the power of the Curse Marks
to the second state.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.890
However, if you move up
to the second state,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.060
the Curse Mark’s erosion
will accelerate drastically

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.190
and if things are left that way
you will die immediately!

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.810
However…

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.850
In order to control
the power of the second state,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.980
it is necessary to allow one’s body
to get accustomed to it

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.890
over the course of several hours.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890
In doing so, you will…

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.890
attain power that is
equal to ours, however…

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.560
Once awake, you can’t possibly
last more than a few minutes…

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.690
and will certainly die!

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.480
Sound vs. Leaf

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.480
Die…and what will happen after that?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.940
You don’t need to worry.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.690
That’s why we’re here.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.020
We will use Barrier Ninjutsu
to suppress the side effects.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.440
We will mitigate that phase

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.520
to ease you from eternal death
to a state of half death.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.900
You really think I can put my faith
in your Barrier Ninjutsu or whatever?

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.310
Master Sasuke…

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.270
We normally function
as Lord Orochimaru’s bodyguards!

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.350
We know our stuff when it comes
to Barrier or Defense Ninjutsu,

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.890
Curse Marks and Sealing Jutsu!

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.440
I absolutely cannot die yet!

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520
I’m counting on you.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.850
Hey!

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.310
We’re gonna lose him
if you guys are slow!

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.150
Get into position!

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.890
Begin!

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.980
– Four Black Mists Formation!
– Four Black Mists Formation!

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.900
Black Seal!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.150
All right. We're done for now.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.850
Man, I’m exhausted.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.890
I didn’t think this mission
would drag on this long.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.940
I’ll go check out the situation.
Let’s go, Raido!

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.400
Right.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.650
Darn. This has sure gotten troublesome.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.400
There’s one…

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.020
No, two of them.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.940
Here they come!

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.770
You guys are Orochimaru’s…

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.190
Judging from the direction
you came from,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.770
it appears that you are on your way back
from the Village Hidden in the Leaves…

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.890
What’s in that barrel?

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.890
Having two Jonin as opponents…

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.730
That’s a tough one.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.520
Every one of them
got the Curse Marks…

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.020
You refuse to answer?

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.770
This will be different from that time before
with your surprise attack.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.690
Shut up, you scum!

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.020
Just drop dead!

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.890
Orochimaru’s toys…

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.310
Don’t you dare monkey around
with Leaf Shinobi!

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.940
Those two are really late, aren’t they?

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.480
What should we do, Shizune?

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.900
Let’s go see!

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.730
Right!

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.150
Shikamaru!

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.270
What’s the matter?

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.480
There’s a smell of blood nearby.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.890
Wh-What’s this?!

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.900
Raido! Genma!

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.890
This isn’t good!

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.520
I can’t believe these two
could have been taken down…!

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.810
The best I can do right now is
give him some stop-gap treatment…

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.230
Shizune…

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.190
I’m gonna hunt those guys down!

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.560
No!

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.270
B-But…

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.890
W-Wait…lwashi.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.850
Th-The Jutsu that those guys have
is no longer that of mere Shinobi…

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.890
If you pursue them alone,
you'll only die.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.890
Genma…don’t talk anymore!

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.890
The smell of the other two impinged
on the five others including Sasuke…

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.690
But the five are moving away
from the smell of the blood!

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.730
What should we do?!

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.980
Just as I thought.
He has guides.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.060
This has really turned into
a real pain in the neck.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.230
Let’s hurry up and pursue Sasuke!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.020
Shut up, Naruto!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.890
That’s for Shikamaru to decide!
Don’t play the boss!

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:05.940
Shikamaru?

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.150
The fact that there was
the smell of blood probably means

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.440
that a battle occurred somewhere.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.810
If we go to that location we should
be able to gather some information…

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.770
We must be attentive
as we near the location,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.520
so we would have to switch over to

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.900
a reconnaissance pattern
and approach walking slowly…

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.890
While all that’s going on

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.900
Sasuke will cross over
the Land of Fire border!

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.890
What are we gonna do, Shikamaru?!

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.190
All right! Let’s pursue Sasuke!

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.100
All right! That’s what I was waiting for!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.850
However…

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.890
The fact that there was a battle
means they’ll have their guard up.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.480
They’ll certainly be aware

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.730
of the fact that there might
be Ninja on their tail.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:00.890
In other words,

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.690
the odds are high that
there will be traps or an ambush.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.230
Listen carefully…

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.890
Hereafter, I want you to use your visual
and acoustic senses to the fullest!

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.850
We need to locate those guys before
we get caught in an ambush!

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.690
And if we come across
anything suspicious,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.770
don't just dodge them,
interpret them!

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.770
All right!

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.940
When we find them,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.890
I’m gonna use my new Jutsu
to clobber them!

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.850
That Naruto…

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.900
Each time I see him
he’s added a new Jutsu to his arsenal.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.730
Darn! Just when I thought
I had caught up with him…

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.060
Hey! The enemy’s smell is everywhere!

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.730
Everybody! Stop!

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.480
Take a careful look above you.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.650
Paper Bombs…

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:55.980
And in five other places too!

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.520
The figuration is that of
a Perimeter Barrier.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.890
Perimeter Barrier…?

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.650
It’s one type of Booby Trap Ninjutsu!

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.100
Perimeter-type traps have a time lag
and are activated

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:13.520
when one enters the area that
has been marked by the enemy.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.690
It’s advanced Jutsu…

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.020
It was in one of the books that
my father made me read.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.980
Darn! Our only choice
is to make a detour…

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.520
Lee… Do what you have to do!

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.730
Lee!

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.190
It’s too soon to be doing that!

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.400
Lady Fifth Hokage!

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.480
I already know that
you’re a foolhardy guy.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.940
But you’ve just had an operation.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.890
You don’t need to be rushing
into things.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.190
I want to hurry up and
do even a little training.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.020
I also want to… I want to…

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.150
Building your strength isn’t
the only form of training.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.230
Don’t you agree?

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.350
It is said that Ninja are those

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.310
who can forebear and
endure any hardship.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:53.890
I understand how you feel but…

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.890
That means that this too
is one kind of training.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.650
Training…

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.890
What if you were to do something foolhardy
and you got worse?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.350
Wh-What’s that?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.100
It’s medicine that I prepared.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.850
First, drink this and get better!

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.810
Right!

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.440
Come, let’s go…

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:24.440
Yes, ma’am.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.890
Damn! Nothing but traps!

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.890
Yeah, but the enemy seems
pressed for time.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:38.560
The traps have noticeable flaws.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.890
Hey, hey, Naruto!
There’s wire at your feet!

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.520
Don’t trip on it!

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.560
I know that already!

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.020
Wait, Naruto!

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.270
Shadow Possession Jutsu…

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.100
M-Made it just in the nick of time.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.890
Naruto! I told you to be careful!

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:24.480
I see… One of the wires is
readily visible because it reflects light.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.850
The other wire has been coated
with a matte green.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.900
So it’s very difficult to see
with the naked eye.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:34.310
It’s a double trap, huh.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.440
Despite the fact that
they’re in a hurry,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.560
that’s certainly an elaborate trap.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.230
Which means that…

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.520
That they’re at rest.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.940
Perhaps they got injured,
or that itself could be a trap…

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:50.890
Byakugan!

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.230
Caught ‘em!

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.020
All right! All right!
I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:07.810
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:10.600
but I’m gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:12.690
Me too!

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.890
Don’t be so hasty.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.890
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy…

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.850
we’ll make direct contact
with the target!

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:43.560
Darn! When we’re in a hurry,
having to take a darn break…

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.150
It can’t be helped.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.270
When one fights at the second state,
one’s body gets drained drastically.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.020
More than that,

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.980
it’s an ordeal not to be able
to use one’s body for a while…

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.890
It can’t be helped with
two Jonin-class guys as the opponents.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.980
If we act in moderation,
we’ll be done in.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.270
Kiba…

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.890
In that event,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.690
don’t mess up the timing
of the Smoke Bombs.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:14.770
Got it!

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.690
Now then…

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.310
we'll split up into two teams.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.560
– Right! 					– Okay!

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:22.310
It looks like they haven’t noticed us yet.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.810
Hey, Sasuke's not around.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:30.890
It appears that…

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.890
He’s inside that “coffin.”

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.890
Is he dead?!

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.600
That barrel is secured with Barriers.
I can't see through it.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.190
I wouldn’t think that the guys
who wanted Sasuke

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.150
would kill him that easily.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.730
You might be right about that.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:32.890
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:38.480
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.770
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:53.900
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.650
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.690
Look like a mountain

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.350
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.190
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.520
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.770
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.890
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.100
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.850
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.940
Look like a mountain

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.270
Gimme a break, Shikamaru!
You're not reliable in the least!

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.480
And you still call yourself
a leader?!

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.350
But this situation sure
is a problem.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.270
Leave this kind of thing to me.
lt'll be a cinch.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.310
– I sure hope it will be.
– What do you mean by that?!

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.350
It's too much of a hassle to explain.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.690
– Shut up, Akamaru!
– Shut up, Akamaru!

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:05.850
What was that?!
Give 'em some more, Akamaru!

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.890
Well, if things come to this,
I'll use that special weapon, Rasengan!

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.890
Next time: "Squad Mutiny:
Everything Falls Apart!"
