WEBVTT

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.300
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.800
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.420
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.000
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.420
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.420
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.090
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.920
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.210
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.590
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.880
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.460
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.050
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.550
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.170
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.790
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.460
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.250
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.790
A Dubious Offer!
Tsunade's Choice

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.090
Not good…

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.460
Dang it! Dang it!
This time for sure…no matter what!

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.550
You’re the only one who can treat
Lord Orochimaru’s arms.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.790
Why don’t we make a deal?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.170
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.050
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.550
Don’t you want to see those two,
Tsunade…?

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.960
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.500
Their wishes…
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.340
And dreams…
Did you forget them?!

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.790
I’ll be straight with you.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.920
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.800
The successive line of Hokages

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.790
have protected the Leaf Village
and those living in it.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.460
They brought troubled times under control

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.960
and helped the village to prosper.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300
They risked their lives for
this dream, this ideal!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.840
You don’t have to answer right now.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.790
However, I want it in a week.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.500
Also, two human sacrifices are
needed for this Forbidden Jutsu,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.790
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.210
We are starting!

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.710
C’mon. Place your bets!

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.000
Which will you bet on, ma’am?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.800
Which one? C’mon!

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.130
Which one will she choose?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.790
If she agrees to our conditions,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.380
your arms will be healed,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.840
and the destruction of the Leaf Village
will continue immediately.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.250
Lady Tsunade will also be able to
be reunited with the two whom she loves.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.790
But if she doesn’t agree…

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.090
I’ll have to force her to heal my arms…

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.210
Will it really be that easy?

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.090
I have you.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.790
There’s no need to worry.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.210
I’m the one who knows her the best.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.790
And her greatest weakness!

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.300
She’ll definitely accept the conditions…
Definitely!

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.130
Listen, in this third step,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.050
you’ve got to use 100%
of what you have learned…

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.550
And retain them.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.630
In other words,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.460
imagine creating a single layer
within the balloon

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.420
and compressing the Chakra inside it.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.590
I know that in my head…

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.790
But no matter what,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.170
I can’t completely hold 100%
of my power in a neat ball…

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.590
Don’t give him false hope by teaching him
something he can't master.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.380
That’s why the moony kid
starts joking about becoming a Hokage!

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.960
Tomorrow, huh.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.790
Come again, okay?

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.130
I certainly will!

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.790
Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.340
To think she’d be that shaken up…

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:45.340
Something extreme must have happened.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.630
That one week bugs me, somehow…

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.790
And Naruto hasn’t come back
to the inn for nearly a week.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.500
I guess I’ll press Tsunade a little more.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.750
No good…

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.800
No good… Why?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.050
Here there’s no time…
lt’ll be too late.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.670
What’s this…?!

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.790
What happened, Naruto?!

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300
Are you okay?

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:04.710
What do you want?

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.090
The moon’s out.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.840
How about going out for a drink?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.790
Tomorrow will be the one week
you promised to Naruto.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.250
I wonder what became of Naruto?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.790
Beats me.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.500
I guess I’ll have something.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:47.790
Radish, please.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.790
Coming up.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.300
Oh?

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.380
Here you go.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.380
Ooh! This looks good.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.880
Lady Tsunade!

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.790
What happened to Naruto?

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.790
He’s quite exhausted and weakened.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.790
And his right hand is severely burned
with Chakra…

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.590
As it stands now,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.840
this kid probably won’t wake up
until the day after tomorrow.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.800
It’s as Jiraiya says…

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.050
Why did I make such a stupid bet?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.130
What am I, of all people,
getting so worked up for?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.500
How stupid.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.880
Tomorrow…

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.630
Please don’t go tomorrow!

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.920
Why don’t you say anything?!

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.590
Lady Tsunade! Please don’t be silent.
Please answer!

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.960
If you say that you’re going…

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.090
What will you do?

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.630
I’ll stop you with my life!

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.960
Shizune… Have you forgotten
who you’re talking to?

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.790
Sir! It’s morning, now!
lt’s about time you went home!

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.630
Geez.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.630
Hey! Get up, sir…

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.880
Hey! What’s wrong, you?!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.300
It’ll be troublesome if we’re disturbed
during the negotiations…

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.380
What do you want me to do?

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:55.420
It might be good to kill…
Tsunade’s attendant.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.300
It seems that you…

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.210
You don’t trust me completely…yet.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.170
Precisely because I trust you…

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.210
I would like to leave Sasuke
in your hands.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.090
Well, then…

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.790
Kabuto…

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.710
If you wish to stop me…

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.550
You have no choice
but to kill young Sasuke, now.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.920
You can’t possibly kill me…

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.340
Hey!

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.790
I said hey!

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.250
Naruto…?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.790
Oh no! What time is it?
No, what day is it?

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.960
It’s Monday…

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.420
What is it?

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.710
Is your body okay?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.550
As I recall, you were supposed
to sleep for two full days…

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.130
No matter what the wound,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.880
I’m always able to recover
if I sleep one night!

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.630
That’s right.
This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.710
More importantly,
where’s that stupid old woman?!

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.960
Today’s the promised bet day.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.790
Then, what about the Jutsu…

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.250
It’s still not complete, but I can wing it…
Believe it!

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.340
That’s right. This isn’t the time for this.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.840
– Naruto, please stay…
– Huh?

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.590
You are…!

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.840
What?! Oh!

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.880
Wait, Shizune!

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:06.590
That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.960
I can’t build up my Chakra well…

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:14.340
And my body is so numb,
I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.550
What was he gonna do
if that had hit me?!

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.380
That’s lame! Here you’re always bragging
about how you’re this awesome Ninja!

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.210
And you’re nailed by her perverted attack?
You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.670
Shut up!

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.170
Even if she’s rotten,
she’s still a medical specialist.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.790
She’s the only one who could concoct
a tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.840
But to think I’d be caught off-guard,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.750
no matter how intoxicated I was…

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.050
I’m going to kill you, bastard!

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.790
How are you feeling,
Master Jiraiya?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.960
Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.790
But be that as it may,
maybe around thirty percent…

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.420
I never thought I’d end up encountering
that Master Jiraiya in a place like this…

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.790
Things have gotten difficult.
I guess I’ll pull back for now.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:44.090
At any rate, Naruto…
To think you’d be here, too…

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.790
Hey! Shizune.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.210
Y-Yes?!

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.500
It’s about time you tell me

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.800
what the heck she was talking about
with Orochimaru.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:04.790
Orochimaru?!

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.250
I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade…

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.630
That’s why I couldn’t say until now.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:19.210
But…

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.790
There’s no time.
Please come with me!

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.790
I’ll explain as we run!

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.790
Okay!

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.170
I’m going, too!

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.960
What’s your answer?

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.380
Say what?!

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.300
The answer to that is definitely no!

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.460
This might be really bad…

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.250
She’s probably still thinking
of those two.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.790
Perhaps I may have no choice,
but to kill Tsunade…

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.340
Dang it!

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.960
I’ll heal your arms…

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.380
In exchange for that,
keep your hands off the village.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.630
Very well.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.590
Now then…

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.790
He’s planning to once again attack

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.790
the Leaf Village if
his arms are healed!

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.300
The situation will get
even more dangerous than that

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.380
if he’s not stopped now.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.790
Him screwing around like that!

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.790
I have you.
There’s no need to worry…

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.800
What’s the meaning of this?

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.920
To think you’d betray me at this point…

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:17.460
Tsunade!

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.790
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.130
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.300
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.920
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.670
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.420
That hold us together

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:58.050
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.790
you say laughingly

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.790
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.750
Like a comet,

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.790
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:24.920
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:35.380
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:44.210
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.300
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.420
What the hell is this?! This castle
has been destroyed even further!

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.050
It seems Tsunade has
declined the deal.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.630
But…but the old lady is not here!

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.420
Calm down a second.
She shouldn't have gone far from here.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.170
Oh, some incredible noise
from that direction, Pervy Sage!

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.670
Well, well…she started a flashy battle.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.000
Naruto, we go after her!

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.790
Right! I'm ready anytime!

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.130
Next time:
 "Breakdown! The Deal is Off!"
