WEBVTT

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.030
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.940
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.240
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.400
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.570
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.110
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.990
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.110
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.280
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.950
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.070
I’m counting on you, Choji!

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.280
Yeah!

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280
Expansion Jutsu!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.650
All right, let’s go!

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.450
Human Boulder!

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.860
What?!

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.940
Choji… You are awesome, after all!

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.740
Full Throttle Power!
Choji, Ablaze!

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.990
They got away from
my Barrier Ninjutsu…

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.940
He’s the only one here.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.900
Seems like the others went ahead.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.610
Yeah.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.360
They’re not around
here any more.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.400
Damn… Just when we thought
we caught up.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.400
Everybody, you did well…

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.320
for some losers.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.360
What?!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.940
Who are you calling losers?!

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.940
Once we’re out, it’s our battle to win!

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.650
I-I will do it!

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.940
Wait you two!

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.940
It’s dangerous to fight them
head on right now!

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.070
We tore through the barrier!
We can do this!

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.030
Tunneling Fang!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.320
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.610
– Take this! 					– Take this!

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.940
You guys are my meal!

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.950
Darn it!

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.530
Shoulder Charge!

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.070
Knee Lift!

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.860
Not even good enough for an appetizer!

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.150
Be careful everyone!
Another tricky one is coming!

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.900
Earth Style Barrier:
Earth Dome Prison!

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.240
Expansion Jutsu!

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.700
Human Boulder!

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.150
Damn!

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.030
Such useless acts…

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.400
There’s no time.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.940
We’re going to split into two here!

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.280
Why?!

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.940
I see…

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.320
Even at 5 against 1,
with our Chakras taken away,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.570
he’s not someone we can
easily defeat…

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.940
If we take our time,
Sasuke will pass the borders.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.990
If that happens, we won’t be able
to handle this on our own.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.070
So we split up…
one team to stop him

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.320
and one to go after Sasuke, right?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.200
Yeah. The sub leader is going
to be you, Neji.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.150
I found them!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.110
Neji! Take Kiba and Choji,
and go after Sasuke!

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.200
Got it!

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.240
This guy…

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.820
Naruto and I will handle!

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.940
Are you going to put
the Shadow Paralysis Jutsu on me again?

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.320
Such a foolish Jutsu.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.530
I don’t need to see that kind of
street performance more than once!

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.490
And who was it that got tricked
by that street performance earlier?

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.780
He disappeared?!

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.200
Behind us!

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.650
Earth Style: Sphere of Graves!

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.940
He’s nuts!

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.950
Be careful!
There’s another one coming!

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.950
You are the platoon leader,
if I’m not mistaken.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.530
You sure do suffer
when you have a stupid leader.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.320
You underlings!

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.320
A stupid leader like this…

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.280
I’ll get rid of for you!

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.400
Expansion Jutsu! Human Boulder!

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.940
Thanks! Choji…

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.070
Why? Wasting my good intentions…

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.950
If the leader is stupid,
then I guess the subordinates are losers.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.490
Well… I’ll kill you losers
before you suffer

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.940
working under
a glum shadow lover like him!

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.820
Darn, darn! Babbling on like that!

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.400
I will…!

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.320
He’s mine!

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.940
I will…take care of him!

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.030
Choji…

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.610
What are you saying?!

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.150
He’s not the kind of guy
you can handle on your own!

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.900
I will do it!

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.280
Choji… you…

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.700
Shikamaru…
Take these Food Pills for everyone…

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.950
Choji… You are not…

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.360
That’s right.
I have that secret weapon of mine.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.820
But Choji, that is…!

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.610
Huh… Losers, I won’t let you
have your way!

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.570
He’s coming!

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.740
I’ll get rid of you all here!

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.700
Go, everyone!

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.860
Pills of three colors?
They’re not Food Pills.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.950
What are they?

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.780
First…Spinach Pill!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.990
Get out of the way! Loser!

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.940
Impossible… He stopped me?!

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.740
Shikamaru, take everybody and go!

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:06.940
Choji…

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.740
What did we gather for?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.450
If we lose Sasuke,
then we will end up like he said…

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.400
The stupid leader and his losers!

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.450
You better catch up with us, Choji!

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.280
Yeah.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.110
Everybody, go!

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.110
All right! Let’s go, everyone!

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.530
– Yeah! 					– Right!

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.280
Choji…

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.530
I’m going to get rid of you quick
and get rid of those guys too!

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.530
It won’t be that easy…

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.940
What?!

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.940
I will…

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.240
…stop you!

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.700
A parting gift from Choji…
Eat it!

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.570
Yeah!

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.860
Thanks, Choji…

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.030
Kiba!

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.110
Thanks!

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.940
Shikamaru…
That pill that Choji took earlier..

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.150
It seemed like some sort
of trump card,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.320
but does he have a chance to win?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.940
He said that he has a secret weapon.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:20.780
He brought the Akimichi clan’s
ultimate secret pills on this mission…

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.450
These are the Triad Colored Pills
of green, yellow, and red.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.530
If you take it,
you can gain explosive powers.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.150
The energy that each pill
contains is enormous!

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.280
I see! I see!
So that’s why he was so confident!

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.570
But…there’s always a side effect
to any pills that work too well.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.940
Damn… I didn’t think it would hurt
so much with just the Spinach Pill.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.610
I hope that Choji can settle it
with just the green pill.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.860
Don’t take the red one,
no matter what, Choji.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.200
I’m going to finish you at once!

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.940
Expansion Jutsu!

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.450
Spiky Human Boulder.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.240
He raised the rotational
and destructive power

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.200
by using the Kunai Knives as spikes!

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.610
Earth Style: Terra Shield.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.570
What?!

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.900
I-I did it…?

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.940
Yeah. That’s what I was thinking too.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.400
Akamaru… 					What is he saying?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.280
You know that Akamaru
can tell the strength of the enemy

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.700
just by the smell, right?

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:05.200
He’s worried if Choji is going to be able
to handle that monster with just the pills.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.940
True…

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.320
If we were to assess
the situation objectively,

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.860
that giant’s ability is unknown…

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.940
The possibility of Choji being able
to defeat him might be close to zero.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:19.360
But…

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.110
That is how battle is…

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.860
Don’t get carried away, loser!

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.570
Shatter Palm!

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.200
Did you know?

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.570
When there’s a group of people
of five or so,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.700
there’s always one loser.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.530
That person is always made fun of…

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.780
and when it comes down to it,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.320
they’ll just toss that person
aside like a pawn.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.360
I’m talking about you!

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:19.200
Choji. All you want to do is eat.
You should train some at least!

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.070
You get teased because you’re like that.
You’re just a f--

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.940
You said somebody exceptional, right?

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.860
Shouldn’t we ask Shino or somebody?!

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.490
This guy is useless too…

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.900
That is true…

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.610
No matter how hard I try on my own…

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.990
I…

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.780
Seems like I hit it right on the nose.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.940
Seems like the Leaf is lacking in people,

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.570
seeing that they pick a loser
like you to be on the pursuit team.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.820
Why don’t we finish this up already?!

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.940
Knee Lift!

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.360
Shoulder Charge!

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.990
Huh! You really are a loser to the end!

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.820
Your high spirit didn’t last long at all,
only at the beginning…!

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.860
You really are the ideal loser!

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.990
A loser like you shouldn’t have come
to a place like this!

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.110
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:52.940
Shikamaru…

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.450
Neji’s right. It’s how a battle is.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.240
From the start, this mission
wasn’t for recreation.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.570
It’s life or death.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.320
Hey Shikamaru…

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.400
I already anticipated the worst scenario

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.240
in which we would be fighting
separately on our own.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.820
And at this point,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.530
if we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.400
we might not be able
to catch up to Sasuke.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.700
Choji is a good guy,
but he doesn’t have the confidence.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.940
He thinks that
he’s the weakest of all of us.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.900
He actually is weak.
Anybody can see that.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.950
That’s why he was the first to
stay behind to try to be useful.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.030
Just as I thought…

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:49.940
But…

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.030
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.150
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.610
But Shikamaru…

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.610
But, if we fight against each other,
you might be stronger.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.110
I might have given up fighting
against you too.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.070
And you’re you…

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.900
But…

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.780
Shikamaru…has always…

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.740
Shikamaru has always
believed in me…

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.200
Choji…are you ready?!

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.450
He believed that I was really strong!

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.450
That’s why he left it up to me alone!

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.110
Just as I thought…

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:33.450
So everybody thinks that…
But…I know…

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.320
More than myself or Neji
or any of us here…

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.150
He is stronger!

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.570
And…I believe it.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.450
Oh? Pretty impressive Chakra.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.650
But…it’s a far cry
from being a main dish…

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.570
Let's go, fatso!

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.490
Don’t YOU say that!

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.610
Partial Expansion Jutsu!

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:33.070
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:38.900
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:43.950
Look like a mountain

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.320
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.940
The remnants of a person crying

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.940
Look like a mountain

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.780
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.610
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.940
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.950
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.280
Look like a mountain

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.530
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.030
Look like a mountain

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.360
Look like a mountain

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.530
I can't move because of the pain.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.240
I didn't think the side effects
of the secret pill would be strong.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.450
What do I do?
I only have one more pill.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.490
But if I take it, if I take it,
I will…surely…

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.940
Next time: "Good-Bye Old Friend!
I'll Always Believe in You!"

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:15.360
Of all people,
I cannot forgive you!
