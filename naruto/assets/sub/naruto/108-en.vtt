WEBVTT

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.270
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.440
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.730
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.100
Damn it!

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.890
I’ll win no matter what!

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.890
Don’t flatter yourself!

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.900
Stop it!

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.270
Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.270
It’s a tranquil village as always…

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.560
The security sucks.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.810
Humph!

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.980
We should just massacre everybody
in such a seedy village.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.980
Calm down, Sakon.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.890
We haven’t come here to fight.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.890
Shut up, you chicken.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.270
If you’re scared,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.940
you should just go home
and go to bed already.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.890
I’m telling you to calm down, Tayuya.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.150
You understand what
our job is this time, right?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.890
Let’s go.
We escort our special guest.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.100
Stop it!

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.440
Damn.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.560
I can’t stop completely.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.890
Kakashi Sensei?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.310
Naruto… That thing you just did was…

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.600
What’re you guys doing
up on top of the hospital?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.980
You went a bit too far
for just a fight, you two.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.810
That Jutsu earlier, no mistake.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.190
It’s the Rasengan.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.560
What’s going on?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.060
How can Naruto use that Jutsu…?

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.270
Were you going to kill Naruto, Sasuke?

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.890
What’re you doing giving yourself over
to a sense of superiority?

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.890
The size of the Chidori there
wasn’t one to be aimed

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.060
at a comrade of the same village.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.890
Why such infantile behavior…?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.690
Sure enough, a reunion with Itachi…

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.400
Sasuke.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.890
Damn it!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.230
Naruto…

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.900
How far will you go…?

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.310
Kakashi Sensei…

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.850
Whatever happened to teamwork?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.310
Was it you…
who taught him that technique?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.310
I think Naruto is still too young
to be handling that Jutsu.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.560
He could’ve killed Sasuke
had something gone wrong…

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.310
Even if it’s a means of resisting
the Akatsuki,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.690
to think you would teach Naruto
that Jutsu…

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.810
Right back at you…

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.690
That Chidori was also considerably hairy.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.650
But I didn’t think he was
the kind of kid

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.520
who’d fire that Jutsu at his comrade.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.690
Or is it that there’s something quite
complicated between him and that kid?

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.100
Well, all sorts.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.890
All sorts?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.890
Quite simply, it’s a relationship

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.480
like the one between you
and Orochimaru in the past.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.520
I see.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.890
To him, Sasuke is a comrade
and a rival at the same time…

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:01.520
Well, someone he considers
an equal.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.440
Most likely, he couldn’t take
Sasuke’s cheap provocation.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.350
He’s been chasing him…

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.310
Chasing him since the Academy days.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.560
Are you hurt…

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.100
Scaredy-Cat?

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.480
Sasuke!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.770
I won’t lose to you!

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.890
For him, it’s neither you
nor me now…

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.900
More than anyone…

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.770
he wants to be recognized by Sasuke.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.690
On the other side of the coin…

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.020
Sasuke feels the speed of Naruto’s growth
at close range and feels inferior.

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.350
To the extent that he thinks
he himself isn’t growing at all.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.190
Scaredy-Cat?

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.810
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.890
Summoning Jutsu!

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.440
Naruto has gotten strong…

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.690
And Sasuke…

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.730
I’m going to kill a certain man,
no matter what.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.190
Revenge, huh…?

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.440
I wonder if Itachi
is frustrating that kid.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.560
So Sasuke doesn’t want
to acknowledge Naruto.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.310
If he acknowledges him,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.810
he just might deny himself
up to this point…

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.650
Rivalry is a difficult thing.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.890
It’s not a very good trend…

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.100
Maybe I’ll do some scolding.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.890
Then I leave Naruto to you.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.890
Well, I have a mission.
And there’s the Chidori thing, too…

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.310
Sakura.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.560
It’s okay. Things can go back to the way
they were in the old days again.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.690
Cheer up.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.150
See ya.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.890
Thanks, Kakashi Sensei.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.850
Naruto…

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.230
Sakura.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.890
Don’t interfere with us!

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.480
You are weak.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.890
Why are you weak?

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.060
It's because you don’t have enough…

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.560
…hate.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.770
What’ve I been doing…

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.230
up until now?

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.770
He got a nice look in those eyes.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.310
Shall we go soon?

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.600
What do you think you’re doing?

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.890
If I don’t do this,
you’ll run away, right?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.150
You’re not the type
to listen quietly to lectures.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.650
As I recall,
that’s Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.520
Sasuke… Forget about something
like revenge.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:13.770
What?

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.020
Well, in this business
I’ve seen a stink of guys like you.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.770
But the final days of those who speak
of revenge are never good.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.440
They’re tragic.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.940
You’ll only hurt yourself and
agonize more than now.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.100
Even if you succeed in revenge,
all that will remain is emptiness.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.190
Shut up!

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.900
What do you know?

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.230
Don’t talk to me as if you know!

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.770
Well, calm down…

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.890
If you like,

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.060
shall I go and kill the person
most important to you?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.520
You’ll be able to realize just
how far off you are

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.890
on what you just said.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.440
Well, I wouldn’t mind if you’d do that.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.480
Unfortunately, I don’t even have
one person like that.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.020
Everyone’s already been killed.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.940
I’ve lived longer than you have…

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:16.980
The times were not good.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.100
I know all too well
the agony of losing something.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.940
Well, both you and I
aren’t the lucky ones…

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.100
That’s for darned sure.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.890
But we’re not the worst, either.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.850
You and I,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.810
we both have already found
dear comrades, haven’t we?

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.890
It’s because I have lost
that I understand.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.060
The Chidori is a power…

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.560
I gave to you because
you now have something important.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.890
You should know that
it’s not a power

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:01.600
to be used on your comrade
or to use for revenge,

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.440
and I’m sure you know
what it should be used for.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:11.100
Think hard about whether or not
what I’m saying is wrong.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:25.100
It’ll be tricky with a Shinobi
of that level hanging around.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.600
So let’s wait a bit.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.890
Maybe jerks like you’d be no good.
But I could do it.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.890
I wonder. “Two”
should be ample to rip him apart.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.600
Don’t be butting in all the time,
you clod.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.810
Tayuya, women shouldn’t
use words like that too…

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.100
Shut up, fatso.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.940
– More, please!
– More, please!

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.310
Wanna head back?

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:10.810
Sure!

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.650
We both made it
to the top of the tree.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.890
Sakura.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.850
I have a something to talk
to you about.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.890
I’ll go out on a date with you,
so come along.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.520
Damn it…

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.890
Damn it!

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.270
The Curse Mark left by Orochimaru
during the Chunin Exam…

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.730
Kakashi Sensei said
it was okay now, but…

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.440
Master Orochimaru.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.890
You didn’t need to send out
all four members, did you?

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:24.600
It seems those kids are all interested
in Sasuke to whom I've taken a liking.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.810
To see what extent his power is…

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.900
A contest of strength or whatever,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.190
at this point Sasuke would be
no match for them.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.890
That is precisely why…he will come to me
in search of power.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.650
Who’re you guys?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.480
I’m Kidomaru, the East Gate
of the Sound Ninja Four.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.980
I’m Sakon,
the West Gate of the same.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.890
I’m Jirobo,
the South Gate of the same.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.850
I’m Tayuya,
the North Gate of the same.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.520
I’m in a bad mood now…

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.600
If you wanna continue to fight her,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.190
I won’t go easy on you!

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:32.350
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.940
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:43.230
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:53.600
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:59.100
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.150
Look like a mountain

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.890
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.890
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.980
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.230
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.560
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.810
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.310
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.650
Look like a mountain

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.350
A date, a date!

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.890
What do you want to eat, Sakura?

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.690
Anything's fine.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.850
At any rate,
Kakashi Sensei's over the top.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.560
I just wanted to fight

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.810
But if Kakashi Sensei hadn't stopped it,
right about now…

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.730
Of course, which of us was stronger

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.480
Listen, Naruto…

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.890

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.850
