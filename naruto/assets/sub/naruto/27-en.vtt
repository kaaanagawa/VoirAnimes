WEBVTT

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.060
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.130
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.930
At the final moment push hard

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.100
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.380
Gently open your heart

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.340
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.350
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.690
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.350
I like your determination!

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.190
Then…

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.160
For those who are still here…

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.890
The first test...

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.130
you have passed it!

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.410
You’ve passed through the gates!

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.010
The first test for the Chunin Exams
has been completed…

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.250
I wish you well.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.980
All right! Wish us well!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.820
What a funny guy…

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.580
Huh…

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.310
I didn’t think that there would be
a guy who would pass the first test

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:49.510
with a blank test sheet.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.350
Naruto Uzumaki.
He really is a funny guy.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.650
The Chunin Exam Stage 2:
The Forest of Death!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.330
There’s something kind
of creepy about this place.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.870
This place is called the Forest of Death,
you’ll soon realize why.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.570
“The Forest of Death,
you’ll soon realize why.”

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.880
That kind of threat won’t work
on me one bit!

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.210
I’m not scared!

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.550
Really?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.980
You’ve got a lot of energy.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.590
A kid like you dies at very beginning,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.300
dappled with the red blood I like.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.380
I’m returning your…Kunai Knife…

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.640
Thank you for taking the trouble…

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.420
But…don’t stand behind me,
thirsty for blood.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.090
If you don’t want a quick death…

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.800
Well, it’s my nature to act up
at the sight of red blood.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.670
And my precious hair was cut,
so I got excited…

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.440
Naruto…

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.340
I’m sorry…

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.250
W-What with that Proctor?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.080
Frankly, she’s psycho!

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.390
This one, too…

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.560
That girl, why was her tongue so long?

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.500
Evidently, we’ve got
a lot of hot-blooded kids this time.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.430
This will be fun.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.200
You’re the most hot-blooded! Believe it!

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.180
Well, before we start the second exam,
I have to pass this out to you!

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.550
It’s a consent form,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.960
before you can take part
in the test you have to sign this.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.930
Why?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.900
From here on out,
corpses are going to come out,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.560
I have to get your consent to that!

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.570
Or it’ll be my responsibility.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.710
Well, I’m going to start
the explanation for the second exam.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.550
In a word, the limits of
your survival will be challenged.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.520
Survival, huh?
This test is a total pain.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.000
First, I’ll give you step-by-step instruction
on the terrain of this Training Field.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.600
Training Field Number 44 is surrounded
by 44 locked entrance gates,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.270
there are rivers and a forest
and a tower in the middle.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.610
It’s about 10 kilometers
from the towers to the gate…

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.980
In this confined area, you will
go through a certain survival program.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.820
The contents of which are…

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.230
anything goes scroll battle!

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.130
Scroll…?

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.100
Yes…

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.800
I want you to fight for two scrolls,
the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.880
All together 26 teams got
through the first test.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.750
Half of them...

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.380
13 teams get the Heaven scroll,
the other half get the Earth Scroll.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.090
I’ll hand over one scroll to each team.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.560
To put it simply,
 that’s what you’re vying for.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.560
And the conditions to pass?

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.770
Three of you bring both the Heaven and
Earth Scrolls to the tower in the center.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.140
That means that of the 13 teams,
half of them will fail for sure…

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.540
Except it has to be in time.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.310
For this second exam,
the time limit is 120 hours.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.010
Do it in exactly five days!

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.120
Five days.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.720
What do we do about food?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.190
Be self-sufficient! It’s a treasure trove
in the wilderness.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.190
There’s more than enough for food…

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.560
However…

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.560
It’s teeming with
fierce people-eating animals,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.560
poison bugs, poisonous weeds and
much more.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.400
No way…

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.530
Fool, that’s why it’s called survival!

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:16.510
Besides, it’s improbable that 39 people,
13 teams will pass.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.710
The interval for activity gets longer
with passing each day,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.510
while the time for recovery
gets shorter…

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.550
Seems pretty grueling!

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.820
On top of that, you’re surrounded
by nothing but enemies,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.560
even falling asleep
will be a problem…

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.960
And, besides those injured
during attempts to capture scrolls…

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.200
there will definitely be people

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.170
are unable to endure
the rigors of the course.

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.300
Umm…so you can quit in the middle of it?

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.310
According to the rules,
you cannot give up in the middle of it!

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.840
I want you to spend
five days in the forest.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.250
Just like I thought…

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.880
This is going to be a pain!

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.520
Moving on, conditions of disqualification.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.820
Number 1, if all three members
of the team can’t make it to the tower

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.030
with the Heaven and Earth Scrolls
within the time limit.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:17.230
Number 2, if a team loses a member
or if a member became incapacitated.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.970
There’s that, and this is a supplement…

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.770
Absolutely do not look at
the contents of the scrolls

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.880
until you have reached the tower!

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.810
W-What happens if we look
at it halfway through?

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.250
When you look at it you’ll find…out!

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.550
Huh?

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.330
There are times when a Chunin
must deal with super-secret text.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.490
This is to test your reliability.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.930
That’s all the explanation!

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.570
I’ll exchange your three consent forms for
the scrolls in that hut over there.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.340
After that, pick your entrance,
and all the gates will open simultaneously!

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.440
Finally, just a word of advice…

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.480
Don’t die!

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.540
I see, so you won’t know which
scroll was given to each team…

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.550
and you won’t know which of
the three people is carrying the scroll.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.380
If what Ibiki said was right,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.590
there will be life or death
struggles for information in this test.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.020
Everyone is an enemy!

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.100
The resolve of everyone here is strong.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.430
That means that it might come
to killing each other.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.540
It looks like they understand the meaning
of the consent form a little bit…

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.680
Heeey, look who’s here!

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.350
It’s Billboard Brow, isn’t it?

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.360
I thought you went home long ago,
I never imagined you were still here.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.030
Ooooh? Look who’s here,
the ugly Inopig.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.960
Starting now, it's five days of
the survival test with Sasuke.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.570
There’s no reason to go home.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.970
– Ugly! 					– Billboard!

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.010
– Ugly! Ugly!
– Billboard! Billboard!

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.540
– Ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.480
– Billboard, billboard, billboard!
– Ugly ugly ugly!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.540
– Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!
– Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.550
Sakura, this is impossible for you.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.150
For your own sake,
just hurry up and go home!

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.550
I could say the exact same thing to you!

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.900
Hey, why are those two
on such bad terms?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.600
D-Do you think I care about
something stupid like that?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.400
Man…all there is to do
is write my name,

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.470
why does it take this much time!

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.480
Hey! Hinata! What are you
doing over there?

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.410
N-Naruto…

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.550
Umm…uhhhh…well…

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.820
Just like I thought,
this kid is strange.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:26.560
A scratch…

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.230
Uh-um… this…is--

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.260
See ya!

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:37.770
Naruto…

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.070
It’s about time for
the scroll exchange.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.260
Well, I wonder how
many teams will survive…

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.070
Teams who have
taken the scroll,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.140
stay with the representative
and move to the gate!

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.210
We’ll all start simultaneously
in 30 minutes!!

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.560
Yeah! Survival is our forte!

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.190
Hinata, don’t show your weakness.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.200
Uh, okay…

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:41.570
Life or death…

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:44.300
It’s a pain but we just have to do this.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.840
Since it’s come to this,
Naruto will be our target.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.210
For snacks, there’s potato chips...

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.840
– What about shortcake...?
– I can’t believe you two!

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.880
Okaaaay! I won’t lose!

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.720
I’ll bring down whoever comes near me.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.250
– Yes! 					– Cha!

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.130
Heh heh…finally the opportunity is here…

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.860
We have the chance to fulfill
our mission in earnest…

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.110
Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.610
I’m really scared of spending
five days with this guy.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.550
Target the rookies first.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.550
They said that from now on
it’s okay to kill,

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.020
which makes it easier.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:43.460
Master Guy, I’ll do my best!
I’ll definitely succeed!

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:01.550
We now start the second
test of the Chunin Exam!

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.220
Look for the brats!

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.920
Those three, right?

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.560
All right! Let’s go!

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.170
Okay! First, we search for that thing.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.800
Can you do it, Hinata?

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:28.810
Yes.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.310
Byakugan!

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.680
Slow down, Lee!
We just started.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.420
I know. But…

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.260
I can’t stay still!

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.190
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.560
Hot-blooded fool…

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.370
As you already understand,
we have only one target!

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.880
W-What are you doing, Choji?

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.390
Just a little break…
I’m already tired, and hungry…

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.530
What are you suddenly saying?!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.430
It hasn’t been five minutes
since we started!

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.270
But I can’t help it. I’m hungry…

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.240
You! If you were able to bring snacks,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.010
you should have been able
to bring one Kunai knife!

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.180
Ino! Hide!

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:54.960
Uh-oh!

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.840
This kind of thing continuing
 for five days…?

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.080
Anyway, the tower is the
goal for everyone, right?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.460
So it would be clever for us to make
a trap in the vicinity of the tower.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.760
Okay…wasting no time, huh?

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.500
Where are they?

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.370
Heh…kids.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.900
It’s like begging to be found,
standing in that conspicuous place.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.470
They sensed our presence,

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.340
but, evidently they haven’t
grasped where we are.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.680
What happened? 					You’re pale.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.720
W-What is that?!

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.760
The Flying Leeches of Leaf Village
sense body temperature and perspiration,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.730
then in mass, swoop down
on their prey.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.770
If they continue to suck
your blood for five minutes,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.100
you go to the other world…

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.640
Using this behavior,

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.440
we’d set a trap on the path
enemies would use to escape.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.450
D-Darn it…

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:29.850
That’s one team gone!

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.470
It sounds like they’ve already started.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.140
Wasn't that someone screaming
just now?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.550
I-I’m kinda getting nervous.

00:18:56.050 --> 00:19:00.420
I-It was nothing. Sakura.
Believe it!

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.060
I-I have to pee…

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.360
Y-You…fool!

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.330
What are you doing
in front of a lady!

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.800
Go to the grass!

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.140
Aaah, that was a lot!
I’m refreshed.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.210
Like I said, not in front of a lady--!

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.550
S-Sasuke… no matter what,
you don’t have to go that far.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.220
W-What was that for…?

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.570
What are you doing…all of a sudden?!

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.740
What you ask? That’s my line, isn’t it?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.940
Sasuke!

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.540
It can’t be helped!

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.820
Sasuke, please stop!

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.690
Look closely at him!

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.430
Talk! Where’s the real Naruto!

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.430
I have no idea what
you’re talking about!

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.970
What happened to the scratch
on you face?

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:32.210
I’m asking what happened to the scratch
you got before from the Proctor!

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.380
And your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.350
That guy’s right handed!

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.550
You’re worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.960
Unlucky! You got me.
ln that case…

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.630
Which one of you got the scroll?

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.100
If you listen to me obediently,
I’ll spare your lives.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.680
I see! Then I’ll resort to force!

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.560
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:32.600
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:42.350
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:50.550
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.560
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.500
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.070
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:13.880
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.480
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.820
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.590
Just sing.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.100
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.430
The two are one

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:41.640
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.380
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.850
Aww, stupid gas mask man!

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.020
Suddenly sneaking up on someone
when they're peeing!

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.060
I messed up just a little bit.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.560
Now I have to hurry and
meet up with Sakura.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.990
Wait a minute!
What is this giant snake?

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.630
Hey! Are you serious?!
Wait a minute, hey!

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.570
I've been gulped down!

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.170
Next episode: "Eat or Be Eaten:
Panic in the Forest"

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.270
Will I return to action?!
