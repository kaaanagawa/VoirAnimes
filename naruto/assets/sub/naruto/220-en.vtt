WEBVTT

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.020
So this is the Shukaku?

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.690
It’s the first time I’ve seen
the real thing…

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.300
It’s dangerous here!
We have to get away!

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.570
But! Gaara Sensei…

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.800
Shut up.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.940
Gaara is trying…to protect you!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.210
So hurry!

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.540
R-Right.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.610
Hey! Could that be…?!

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.810
Yeah…

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.650
The Shukaku transformation
is starting.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.550
Gaara…

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
Naruto!

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.420
Naruto!

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.560
Hinata, Sakura.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.400
Matsuri, you okay?

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.360
Y-Yes. But Gaara Sensei…

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330
I leave her to you…

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.880
Hold it! You are badly hurt!

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.850
But…

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.520
You’ll just become unable
to move right away!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.090
I’ll give you some first-aid treatment!

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:28.800
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.550
The distance created between us
became too big,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.560
because we were always together

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.570
Your honest reply, “See you…”

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.270
coming from that brash mouth
makes it sadder.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.840
If you are in an unfamiliar town, crying

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.820
Then I want to deliver you a smile,
even if I’m not by your side

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:32.560
Fly into the wavy and twisted sky,
into your hands

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.840
I can feel it so close,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.110
Our two hearts

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
Departure

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.560
This is bad… It’s a matter of time.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
I knew it.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.230
Sakura! Hurry!
lt looks like we don’t have much time!

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.340
Got it! First, put your hands out.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.570
R-Right…

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.650
What’s the meaning of this?

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.550
What is it, Neji?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.320
That guy wearing the armor is
releasing Chakra stronger than Gaara…

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360
who’s half transformed into a beast.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.600
That person called himself Seimei,
the creator of the Village of Artisans.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.900
He said something about being reborn
as the ultimate Ninja tool.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.900
That jerk!
He’s taken away Gaara’s Chakra!

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.180
Come to think of it, the enemy
we fought wore similar armor…

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.510
and took away a great deal
of my Chakra.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.850
Armor that sucks up Chakra…

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.320
And that alarming form…

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.080
It doesn’t look like
we can just carelessly get close.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.190
Now… What do we do?

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.060
I didn’t figure on fighting
against the Shukaku…

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.130
However, this is fun, too.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.600
As great as the Shukaku may be,
this way, I can prove that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.000
it’s no match for the ultimate Ninja tool
of the Village of Artisans.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.180
Why is this guy so strong?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.190
I won’t allow my important people…

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.190
to get hurt!

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.960
If not, I will stop you,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.970
even if that means that
I have to kill you!

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.670
Why…?

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.700
How is it that you can fight
so much for other people…?

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.580
They saved me from
the hell of being all alone.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.610
They accepted me for
who I was…

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.480
that’s why…
they are important to me!

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.560
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.260
and to love and watch over that person…

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.500
Love…

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.830
That is why he is so strong?

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.490
Gaara!

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.360
What’s that?
Gaara Sensei is returning to normal?

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.570
What happened to him?!

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.470
Gaara might be suppressing
Shukaku of his own volition.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.640
Why? Wouldn’t he end up weakening
his own battle strength?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.210
Even so, he chose to fight
with his own strength and will,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.050
not Shukaku's power,
which he can’t control.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.980
So you couldn’t maintain
the Shukaku body with that Chakra?

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.180
I’ll…help the friends important
to me with my own power…

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.020
How absurd.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.550
A Shinobi doesn’t need emotion.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.360
It is those who suppress their emotions
who can obtain great power.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.260
Great power.
That power is the only justice.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.560
You’re finished now.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.840
Eat this!

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.550
That’s as far as you go,
monster of the Sand Village.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.720
Acting tough, huh…?

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.400
You shouldn’t have
any Chakra left to fight with.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.430
Indeed,  I only have a little bit
of Chakra left…

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.340
But do you think I just sat around
in the cage doing nothing at all?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.510
What?!

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:45.940
Sand Tsunami!

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.550
You shouldn’t have
any sand you can control!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.560
I’m Gaara of the desert!

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.560
It’s simple for me to crush rocks
and turn them into sand.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.180
Kujaku: Hurricane Formation!

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.550
So you still had
that much power left, huh?

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.550
Then I’ll just suck up all of that power!

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.200
Gaara’s Chakra is being sucked out!

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.300
– Wha--?! 					– Gaara Sensei!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.130
– Damn it! 					– Wait! Naruto!

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.540
What, Shikamaru? Don’t stop me!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.570
You’ll just get in the way if you go!

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.110
Besides, our Gaara is strong!

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.010
Gaara…

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.890
Extreme Tempered Ultimate Attack:

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.960
Shukaku's Pike!

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.180
Wh-Why…? Why could you…?

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.480
Someone who gave up on being human
and was reborn as a Ninja tool

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.550
could never understand anyway.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.550
I don’t understand. Why?

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.590
Why?!

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.460
Giant Sand Burial!

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.940
He did it!

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.810
Gaara Sensei won!

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.510
Yeah! Gaara!

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.920
– Gaara! 					– Gaara!

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.930
He’s okay…

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.000
He’s just extremely fatigued

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.600
on account of using
his Chakra all at once.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.140
Gaara completely suppressed
the Shukaku on his own volition.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.640
Yeah…

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.180
I want to work hard

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.550
and become an existence acknowledged
by other people…

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.550
I thought that looking
at Naruto Uzumaki.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.890
Ties with other people…

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.590
For me, until now, that was just hate
and murderous intent.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.560
However, there’s something
I’ve understood just a little…

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.800
about the ties he goes so far for
and talks about.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:39.580
Suffering, sorrow and happiness
can be shared with someone.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.550
You’ve also made someone
you can share with at last…

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:48.920
Did you say something?

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.350
No, nothing…

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.730
We came to the trouble
of rushing here.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.260
To think it’d be over…

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.630
It seems
the inexperienced knuckleheads

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.170
have grown a teeny weeny bit…

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.470
You are very strict.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.140
Pervy Sage!

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.270
Oh, long time no see, Naruto.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:45.280
Don’t give me that “long time no see”
garbage, you jerk Sage!

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.440
You were talking all big about
watching my training,

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.680
making me into your protégé
and stuff!

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.250
Where were you traipsing
around until now?!

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.820
Well, how can I put this?
I was gathering information.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.520
It was probably just information
on naked ladies anyway, right?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.860
You idiot!

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.700
Even I come through when it counts…

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.570
I was mainly after information
on the Akatsuki.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.130
Akatsuki!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.140
With this I’ve been able
to verify their actions.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.840
And now as promised,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.540
two years later when
they’ll move into high gear,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.210
I will thoroughly train you.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.560
I wonder if you’re prepared?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.960
I’ve been tired of waiting!

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.670
I owe you one.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.810
No. I just repaid the debt
from last time.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.850
Next time, I’ll settle things
more properly.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.680
Well, this time I’ll acknowledge
that you didn’t cry.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.420
Not again.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.520
Just like a woman…

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920
What about him?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.090
Huh?

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.720
Naruto?

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.460
I hear he’s leaving today on
a training journey with Jiraiya.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.060
Jiraiya? One of the Genius Sannin?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.730
Yeah. 					lt’s such a pain.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.400
He’s going to come back
having gotten stronger again.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.770
See you around.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.770
– Farewell… 					– See ya.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.320
Please tell Naruto…

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.050
Thanks to him,

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.820
I figured out what the words
Gaara Sensei spoke of meant.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.760
I’ll dedicate myself under
Gaara Sensei from now on…

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.600
What did he do?

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.250
Well, I guess that’s about it.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.480
I read the Village of Artisans report
from the other day.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.610
Although it didn’t go as far as
a perfect 100,

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.650
I’ll give you a passing grade.

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.850
No! I’m still very much lacking
in experience.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.890
Of course!

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.190
I’ll have you carry out
several missions

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.460
and get you to build up
lots of experience,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.530
so make sure to dedicate yourself!

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.560
What?! Does that mean
I’m totally going to get overworked?

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.100
Umm, Sakura. Got a minute?

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.170
Ino?

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.640
Sure. What’s up?

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.540
As, as it happens,
I was thinking about it the while…

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.140
But it became totally clear to me
on this mission!

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.310
Clear that I’d be no good at all
at this rate!

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.850
Ino.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.150
It’s frustrating,
but I was envious of you.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.560
You, who everyone depended on.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.560
So, please.
I also want to become a Medical Ninja.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.230
I know it’ll be hard.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.570
But I’ve got guts and I’ll manage
the studying, no matter what.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.540
So could you ask Lady Tsunade for me?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.540
– Sure. 					– Really?!

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.270
But prepare yourself.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.850
Once that happens,
you’ll be my little sister protégé.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.680
What’s that…?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.180
Naturally!

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:24.220
After all, I’ll be your
Medical Ninja superior, you know.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.920
Man, I can’t wait.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.830
You’ll be my lovable little sister protégé.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.860
I’ll train you nice and hard.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.570
Just you watch!
I’ll pass you up right away!

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.670
Ha! Try it if you can! You Ino pig!

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.940
I’ll do it! Billboard Brow!

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.640
Why?! Why is it?!

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.010
What are you talking about?!

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.220
Why was I the only one left out
of the mission the other day?!

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.320
But you were with
a different team then, right?

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.720
But everyone had taken part!

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.930
She’s kind of in a rage.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.560
It’s hard being the only one left out
of a mission.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.800
Come to think of it,

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.800
it seems Naruto finally leaves
for training.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.540
I heard. It seems that Jiraiya
is going to be his mentor.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.010
Damn it! That guy’s going
to get strong again.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.950
It looks like the village will
get quiet for a while.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.980
Viewed in that light,
it’s a little bit sad, isn’t it?

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.350
No! This isn’t the time
to be getting sad!

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.560
I must work hard!

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.560
Several times more,
several times more.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.960
If I don’t work hard hundreds
of times more than Naruto,

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.060
I won’t be able to face him
the next time we meet.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.900
Your guard is off!

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.340
We also must grow by that time.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.450
It’s because trying to improve
by learning from others,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.680
that is what’s called friendship.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.520
Good grief,
we’d better not lose, Akamaru.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.590
Same here!

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.920
Hey, you okay, Lee?!

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.190
I’m fine, I’m fine.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.640
Lady Hinata, let’s call it a day.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.140
What? I’m still…

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.010
It’s about time for his departure.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:31.520
Oh!

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.250
You won’t be able to
see him for a while.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.890
I see… It looks like you’ll be
on a long journey…

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.020
Yeah!

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:48.170
Listen up.
Be sure to train and don’t goof off.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.570
Right! You can count on me!

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.970
It’s about time to go, Naruto.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.480
Right!

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.350
Okay! I’m off, Iruka Sensei!

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.690
I’ll pay you back for the ramen
once I’ve become a success.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.820
Jeez…

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.570
Good luck, Naruto.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.450
Keep your eyes on me.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.190
What’re you doing?!
I’ll leave you behind, Naruto.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.630
Hey. H-Hey, wait up!

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.970
I also have to work hard in order
to catch up with Naruto.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:23.360
The Key to the rusted heart’s door

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:29.570
Will always be smiling right near by

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.510
Even if rains of spears were to fall,
I will run through it

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.010
Because I want to find the joy
without a shape

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.920
This big dream of mine that
cannot be translated to words,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.760
I will make it come true,
even if it were to deepen my wounds

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.730
We stand here today because of
what we believed through,

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.100
That is why I will continue running forward,
never looking away

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.540
Even if I’m told that
there is no bright future

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:14.940
I’ll change it right away,
lighting it with all my feeling

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.820
The wind is probably testing our hearts

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:24.150
In my heart, I gently grasped my hands

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.330
You are probably searching for
the answer to your tears

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.130
Your dream is always waiting near by,
with the answers in its hands

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.770
The Key to the rusted heart’s door

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.940
Will always be smiling right near by

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.180
It’s been two years since his departure.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.550
Now the count down to
the battle begins.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.520
Those who pursue and those
who are pursued.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.820
Time will not wait for the boy.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.190
As Akatsuki Organization begins
to take action,

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.530
the day of Orochimaru’s reincarnation
draws near.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.430
In order to take back what he lost,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:13.540
the boy once again throws himself
into the maelstrom of cruel fate…

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.270
Next time: “Homecoming”
