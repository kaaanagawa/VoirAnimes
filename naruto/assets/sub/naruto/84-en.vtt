00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.410
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.910
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.540
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.120
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.540
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.540
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.200
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.040
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.330
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.700
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.000
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.580
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.160
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.660
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.290
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.870
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.580
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.160
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.370
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.660
Sasuke…?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.410
No… Who is he?

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.740
He's got the same Sharingan
as Sasuke.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.950
Really…

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.620
who’d believe a kid like you to
have the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.000
Why does that guy know
about the Nine-Tailed Fox?!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.580
Naruto, you will come with us.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.160
Roar, Chidori!
Brother vs. Brother!

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.660
That guy is…close by!

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.700
That guy!

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.660
Elder Brother…

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.660
Today…

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.740
when school’s over,
help me train for a Shuriken Jutsu…

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.120
I’m busy… Have father teach you.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.740
But you’re better at Shuriken Jutsu,
Elder Brother…

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.740
Even I can see that.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.580
You always treat me
like a pest, Elder Brother.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.950
Ouch!

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.740
Forgive me Sasuke…
Some other time, okay?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.160
I don’t have time to
pay attention to you today.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.330
You’re always jabbing my forehead
and saying "Forgive me, Sasuke."

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.740
You also say "not today,"
but there's never a day.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.370
Father.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.080
Huh?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.950
Why doesn’t Elder Brother
pay any attention to me?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.450
That guy’s a little strange…

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.250
He’s the type that doesn’t really like
to become intimate with people.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.870
Why?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I don’t know.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.330
I am his father and
still I can’t read that boy…

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.450
Here!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.000
Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.870
If you’re worried about doing
Shuriken Jutsu practice,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.410
I will watch you when you get home.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.740
They’re not practices,
they’re training!

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.910
See you later!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.620
Sasuke, are you on
your way to school?

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.830
Yes.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.740
I saw Itachi earlier on.
He’s really become a man.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.160
He’s already a top-notch Shinobi.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.740
He graduated at the head of his class
at the Academy at the age of seven,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.040
and attained Chunin level
at the age of ten, didn’t he?

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.250
He became adept at using
Sharingan at the age of eight.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.370
Yes, I remember.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.740
That boy is truly
the pride of the Uchiha clan.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.200
By the way,
how old are you now, Sasuke?

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.750
I’m the same age as
when Elder Brother graduated,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.830
but I can’t…

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.040
What’s the matter?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.910
Hey!

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.870
Stop talking nonsense!

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.500
Oh my, dear.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.160
Sasuke, both you and Itachi
come from the same Uchiha clan,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.500
the pedigree of
the Hidden Leaf Village.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.120
Have confidence!

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.450
You’ll be an amazing
Shinobi just like Itachi one day.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.540
Yeah!

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.410
See you later!

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.330
Do your best!

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.580
Study hard!

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.910
That’s right…

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.040
I come from the same Uchiha clan
as Elder Brother…

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.740
I won’t lose to Elder Brother!

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.330
I’m pretty late…

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.290
What was that?

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.450
I had the feeling
there was someone there…

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.740
The lights are out.
Even though it’s not time for bed…

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.250
What’s this?!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.620
W-What’s this?!

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.450
What in the world is this?!

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.740
Uncle… Auntie…

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.950
Father… Mother…!

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.000
Father? Mother?

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.500
Aren’t you here?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.500
There’s somebody here!

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.450
Move!

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:22.660
Move!

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.870
Move!

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.750
Father! Mother!

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.740
Elder Brother!

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.540
Elder Brother!
Father and Mother are…!

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.870
Why? For what reason?!

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.740
Who in the world would do
something like this…?

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.910
Elder Brother… What are you…?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.660
What are you doing,
Elder Brother!

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.620
Foolish little brother…

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.740
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.580
My legs…!

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.740
Stop!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.620
Elder Brother!

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.080
Don’t make me see this!

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.540
Why…?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.870
Why did you, Elder Brother…?!

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.790
No…!

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.120
No…

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.160
Auntie! Uncle!

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:57.950
Father! Mother!

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.200
Stop it! Elder Brother!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.410
Don’t kill Father and Mother!

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.740
W-Why…

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.250
Why did you…? Elder Brother…?

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.450
To measure my abilities…

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:09.740
Measure your abilities…?
Just for that?

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.500
Are you saying that…

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.950
Just for that…
you killed them all?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.870
That is of great importance.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.790
What do you mean…?

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.910
Don’t talk rubbish!

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.120
I’m scared…

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.250
I’m scared!

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.580
Don’t kill me…!

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.660
D-Don’t kill me!

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.750
You are not even worth killing…

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.740
Foolish little brother…

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.740
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!
Hate me!

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.500
And keep on surviving in
that unsightly manner…

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.580
Just continue fleeing and fleeing
and hang onto your life!

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.500
Shall we go outside…?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.870
These guys aren’t just anybody…

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.740
Itachi, it’ll be a pain in the neck
if this kid moves around and…

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.620
Maybe I better chop off
a leg just in case…

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.700
W-What did he say?!

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.740
Now then…

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.750
Long time no see…

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.410
Sasuke.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.740
Itachi Uchiha!

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.330
Itachi…Uchiha?

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:36.250
The same as Sasuke…
An Uchiha…

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.700
Huh…Sharingan…

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.410
And moreover,
he resembles you a lot…

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.700
Who the heck is he?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.660
He’s my younger brother.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.740
But I heard that the entire Uchiha clan
had been murdered.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.000
By you.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.330
Itachi Uchiha…I will kill you!

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.080
I must kill one certain man
without fail!

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.120
That man…

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.040
My elder brother…

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:36.200
I thought I couldn’t die…
without killing him, but…

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.290
That’s the guy that Sasuke
was saying …

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.160
The man he wanted to kill…

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.120
It’s just as you said…

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.700
I held a grudge against you
and hated you.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.370
For the singular purpose of
killing you, I…

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.120
I…

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.200
have lived my life!

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.080
Sasuke…!

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.870
Chidori…?

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.740
I will kill you!

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.740
Die!

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.290
W-What’s going on?!

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.740
I can’t believe that Sasuke’s Jutsu
was so easily thwarted…

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.330
This doesn’t look good!

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.870
I’ve got to do something!

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.740
Chakra permeates the air…

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.370
I see…

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.910
So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.830
You jerk!

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:32.830
You’re in the way!

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.750
Sasuke!

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.740
Darn it!

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.330
Ninja Art: Summo…

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.450
You’re too slow!

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.330
Huh…? I can’t feel the Chakra…

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.040
Darn! Darn! Why is it?!

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.160
My sword Shark Skin
has the ability to…

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.830
cut through and eat Chakra!

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.200
It’s a pain in the butt

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.540
if the kid moves around
and uses Jutsu like that…

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.750
Before these legs…

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.740
Should I chop off these arms?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.330
Why doesn’t it emerge?!

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.120
It’s pointless…

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.330
What?

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.290
You guys just don’t know me much,
do you?

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.410
This man Jiraiya does not fall victim
to any woman’s allurement,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.330
but rather his forte is
winning women’s affection!

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.540
I’m not made to blindly follow after
a woman’s feminine charm!

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.790
When you get to my level,

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:13.580
women yelp with delight
at my sex appeal!

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.450
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.410
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:39.740
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.740
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.580
a role in the shadows

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.790
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.540
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:04.740
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.740
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:18.830
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:24.250
Over and over,
we've seen fools\

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.750
Watch out, Sasuke!

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.790
Naruto, don’t help him.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.790
But…Sasuke is!

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:01.740
It is your duty to watch
through this battle, Naruto.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.790
What?!

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.740
This is his fight…

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.700
This represents everything that
he has been carrying up to now.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.950
Next time: “Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan!”
