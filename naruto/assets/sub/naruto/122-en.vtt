WEBVTT

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.860
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.690
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.070
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.240
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.400
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.950
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.820
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.860
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:12.110
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.780
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.740
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.900
Damn!

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.690
Pretty impressive…

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.110
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.820
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.570
Since it is a pretty complicated song…

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.990
Well…

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.030
Not only did you
immediately understand

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.240
that I’m manipulating
these guys with my flute

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.320
but you understood
how difficult this song is.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.690
You’re a pretty impressive punk.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.740
But you can’t completely
understand this song.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.740
True… Since art is so foreign to me.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.690
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.700
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.820
to control each and every movement
of those guys…

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.780
I’m pretty confident when it comes
to just analyzing,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.690
but this time it’s not looking good.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.450
The reason is…

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.570
I don’t understand
musical notes whatsoever.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.780
Fakeout: Shikamaru's Comeback!

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.570
I’ll specially show you
the Camellia Dance next.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.700
I’ll crush you!

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.450
You shouldn’t say things
you can’t even do.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.030
Shut up!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.280
What?!

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.820
I told you.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.950
This bone is harder than steel.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.700
You should have a taste of it
with your own body.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.780
Damn!

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.690
There’s no one that’s heard
this song and lived.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.490
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.610
The melody’s changed!

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.110
Something’s gonna come!

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.860
What the--?!

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.690
What?

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.150
This is…?

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.900
The speed at which he flees
after determining

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.700
that these Material Ghosts
are dangerous…

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.400
Pretty impressive.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.110
But…

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.490
I’ve used my precious Paper Bombs
and Smoke Bombs all at once

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.450
and all I could do was hide.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.690
That white one…

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.690
bit off my physical energy.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.650
Seeing that shuriken passed through,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.690
that thing is semi-materialistic
with very little mass.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.570
It's Chakra itself with an appetite.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.950
It’s probably Chakra that’s shaped
mostly by mental energy.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.240
That’s why it seeks stability
and craves for physical energy.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.150
If I continue dealing with
those “Hungry Chakra”

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.690
I won’t be able to build up my Chakra.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.610
They’re pretty dangerous.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.070
She’s a Shinobi who can
make special Chakra like me…

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.690
It’s without a doubt, a Secret Ninjutsu.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.070
Which means I should leave
the white thing alone

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.110
and aim for the main body!

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.820
The quickest way would be
to stop the sound of the flute, but…

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.950
it’d be impossible to get close to
that woman in this situation.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:43.150
The next thing would be to capture
those three with Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.280
But that's difficult too since they’re
attacking me separately at different times.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.150
If I let even one escape
I’d be attacked and it’d be the end…

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.780
There aren’t any openings in
either offense or defense this woman…

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.700
Heh! She might be
a pretty good Shogi player.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.150
My remaining Ninja tools
are twelve kunai knives,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.700
nine shuriken, twelve meters of wire,
one Flash Bomb and one Paper Bomb…

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.990
Man…

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.700
I feel like I’m playing without
rooks or bishops.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.690
Did I lose them?

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.690
I guess that’s not possible…

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280
Akamaru?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.240
Here. Eat this, Akamaru.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.530
If you don’t eat you won’t
get your strength back.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.900
All right. Akamaru, let’s go!

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.360
There’s the issue of those guys too…

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.280
Dance of the Camellia!

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.400
There’s no use hiding.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.690
Unless you can predict
these guys’ movements

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.490
there’s nowhere you can run, little rat.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.570
I’ll find you and break you
into pieces right away!

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.820
Now then...

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.200
All right. Everything’s ready.
All that remains is to do it.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.240
There’ll be nine attacks.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.280
The outcome will be decided
during the attacks.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360
One!

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.690
One!

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:54.690
Wishful thinking!

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.150
The Jutsu manipulated by
this sound is invincible.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.860
Whatever plans you have
to win against me…is useless!

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.780
Two!

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.650
Scampering around, you little rat!
Where are you?!

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:33.820
Three!

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.490
So you’re over there!

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.860
Four!

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.030
So it’s a cheap trick.
You think you can make a fool of me?!

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.690
Five…six…

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.530
seven…eight…

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.570
Scurrying around to get away.
What is he thinking?

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.690
Light?!

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:46.690
Nine!

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.690
Oh no!

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.820
He’s lengthened the shadows
with light and …

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.780
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.690
Shadow Possession Jutsu…
a success!

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:58.820
That’s impossible…

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.650
How were you able to predict
these guys’ movements?!

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.240
There’s no way you could have heard
the differences in my music patterns!

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.610
I wasn’t listening to
the sounds at all.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:14.780
There’s something other
than the sounds

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.820
that give away your command patterns,
isn’t there?

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.490
Your fingers!

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.570
It can’t be!

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.820
The movement of the three...

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.650
Are you saying you memorized
my finger movements and predicted?

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.240
There’s no way that’s possible!

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.240
Your right index finger
and ring finger…

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.320
The sound that you make
with those

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.690
along with the left middle finger
and pinkie,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.070
that middle crab pincher man
stands ready.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.820
Your right thumb and index finger,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.780
and your left index finger and pinkie,
the club man charges.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.990
While you were dodging my attacks
and looking for me,

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.650
I was observing each and every one
of your finger moves in detail…

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:18.530
analyzing and memorizing them.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.690
It’s no use…

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.690
They’re bound by
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.450
The most interesting rule
of the Shogi play is that

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.780
you can use pieces you obtain
as your own pieces.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.110
From here on out…
it’s my turn to attack…

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.650
This time I’ll hunt you down
using the three pieces.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.400
You’re looking pretty composed.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.740
Stand ready with a kunai knife
at least.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.150
My weapon is just this flute!

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.320
I told you that there hasn’t been a person

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.240
who’s heard the sound of
this flute and lived, idiot!

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.200
That’s some confidence!

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:11.950
Retreat!

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.860
Too bad you aren’t able to
use the pieces, hey!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.110
Next it’s my turn!

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:32.990
What?!

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.570
Shadow Possession Jutsu,
successful.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:54.690
I told you.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.950
That I’d hunt you down
using the pieces.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.030
I used the three pieces as bait.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.700
In attacking, the first hand
is the trick, a fake.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.950
The basics are to score
with the second hand.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.320
Bastard…

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.400
It can’t be helped.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.900
Now that it’s come to this
I’ll need to force out with power.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.900
I didn’t think that I’d get to
second state in a place like this…

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.200
It ticks me off but…

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.690
I’ll acknowledge it.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.690
This guy was a pretty impressive scum.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:41.450
What is…this?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.610
It’s true you’re somewhat sharp, but…

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.070
It won’t go as
you’ve planned from here!

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.570
What?!

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.530
Is she gonna force herself out
of the Shadow Possession Jutsu?

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.740
What’s with that tremendous Chakra?

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.820
The Jutsu’s gonna come loose!

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.030
I can’t be worrying about
saving Chakra anymore.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.570
There’s no other way
but to use that Jutsu!

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.690
Ninja Art: Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.650
Is he grabbing my body
with the shadow?

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.240
It’s just as if I’m being grabbed
by a real hand…

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.690
But, no more than this!

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.690
Damn! What an incredible strength.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.150
At this distance
I’ll lose to that strength!

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.650
Take this!

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.700
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:52.650
This is bad!

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.110
Is this a…Genjutsu?

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.200
Where are you aiming?

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.240
I can’t move my body…

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.530
While in second stage,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.280
I manipulate many Genjutsu
with my flute.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.360
Of those, this one is
an appropriate for that little rat.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:53.690
The reason is…

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.990
This Genjutsu stops the movement
of the prey and ties it up!

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.150
How’s that? How’s it feel to
be the one tied up?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.690
So this was your last move huh?
Unfortunately, it’s a return checkmate!

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.150
Little rat!

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:26.950
What…?

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.400
This guy...

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.690
He broke his own finger
with his own shadow!

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.990
Did he release the Genjutsu
with that pain?

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.780
On top of that, he kept pretending to
be bound by the Jutsu?!

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:48.400
I told you this already

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.650
that the first hand is the trick,
a fake.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.780
The basics are to score
with the second move.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.240
Moreover this second move…
it’s a little different from earlier.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:00.950
With the Shadow Strangle Jutsu,

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.690
the closer in distance you are
to the subject the stronger the hold.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.900
Damn. I carelessly got too close…

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.950
No, that’s not it.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.690
The most careless thing was
the words you said earlier,

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.070
“my weapon is just the flute.”

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.690
You’re looking pretty composed.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.400
Stand ready with a kunai knife at least.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.740
My weapon is just this flute!

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.690
I told you that
there hasn’t been a person

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.860
who’s heard the sound of this flute
and lived, idiot!

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:35.740
No way…

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820
That’s right.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.570
The reason I threw the kunai knife
right in front of you and missed…

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:49.360
was to lead you to pick it up
and come closer to me, you see?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.360
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:29.490
And you smiled

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.780
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.690
In my own words

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:40.450
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:45.860
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:51.690
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:57.360
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.650
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:10.690
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.740
I feel so sad

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.700
But…

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.070
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.400
And you smiled

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.690
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.070
In my own words

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.450
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.700
And you smiled

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.200
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.200
In my own words

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.860
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.820
No way, that’s ridiculous!

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.200
Am I having a dream or something?!

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.490
But it’s too intense to be a dream!

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.900
That suit with its outstanding
ventilation and supple fit.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.610
On top of that, those eyes,
that hair, those eyebrows!

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.530
You! Why are you here…?!

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.150
Next time: “The Leaf’s Handsome Devil!”

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.650
I sense the approach of a storm!
