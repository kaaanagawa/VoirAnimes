WEBVTT

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.060
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.130
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.930
At the final moment push hard

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.100
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.380
Gently open your heart

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.340
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.350
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.690
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.990
Special technique!

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.060
Shadow  Clone Jutsu, fishing version!

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.260
Thrash about more!

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.820
I want to catch some for curing!

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.430
Three isn't enough!

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860
Three more, you loser!

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.000
This is very taxing, you know?!

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.940
I mean, let's switch!

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300
Sasuke!

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.210
The fire's ready to light!
Fireballs please.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.550
I guess three is okay for the time being…

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.750
Wha--?

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.180
Hey, wait a minute!

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.060
The Scroll's Secret:
No Peeking Allowed

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.360
It's already been four days
since the second exam started.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.560
Yeah.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.630
That's right.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.840
The start of the second exam
was around three in the afternoon.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.970
We only have twenty-five or
twenty-six hours left.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.810
There may already be
some teams that have passed.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.440
That means…

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.480
I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.820
We're soon going to be in a hot spot…

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.960
That's the biggest one.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.060
Believe it!

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.230
Okay…

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.800
Even if we were to try pursuit,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.570
there's probably hardly anybody left
to become targets.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.800
What do we do?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.840
Almost everyone's surely already passed.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.710
Yeah.  It's already been
four days, after all.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.550
Anyway…

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.550
It's early afternoon now…

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.720
Let's have a meal.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.390
You two rest a bit and
I'll go find us something to eat.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.570
Say…

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:16.670
Hmm?

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.470
As I recall, on the other one…

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.940
"Heaven" was written here…

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.650
and unlike this,
both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.250
Umm, when I was shown
the scroll before the exam,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.250
I wasn't really looking.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.550
So, what of it all of a sudden?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.090
Y-You've got to be kidding…?

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.840
For all we know…

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.680
there may not be any Heaven scrolls.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.140
What do you mean, Sakura?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.550
Well, in this second exam…

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.750
four of the five-day
time limit have passed already.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.660
So that means we've already
used eighty percent of the total exam time.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.430
Seventy-eight participants
and twenty-six teams.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.560
There are only thirteen each
of the Heaven and Earth scrolls.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.870
At most there are only
thirteen passing teams.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.540
Moreover, you remember,
don’t you, Sasuke?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.550
That the Orochimaru guy burned
 the “Heaven scroll” that we had.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.550
Which means…

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.690
The teams that will pass had already,
at that point, decreased by one.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.550
Hmm?

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.560
Also, all of the other scrolls are
not necessarily safe, so…

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.070
After parting ways with
the Leaf Village bunch,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.570
we allotted two days for healing…

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.670
So from here on, we have to increase
the distance of our actions.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.680
At any rate,
the next enemy is our last chance.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.250
I'm going to get some drinking water.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.230
Say! Say!

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.770
I have a good way for us not to fight
with an enemy. Believe it!

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.900
What?!

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.310
Get serious!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.280
I am serious.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.550
I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.520
Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,
for notes….

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.750
If we tweak this a little and change it
into exactly like the Heaven scroll…

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.350
H-Hold it!

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.260
Huh?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.860
Even if you did such a thing,
you don't know what's written on the inside!

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.900
If the Proctor looked inside
you will be discovered right away!

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.700
Idiot!

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.130
Generally with things like this,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.170
there's a password or
something written

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.340
and you can’t get it
unless you have both scrolls.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.540
In other words…

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.110
to pass at the tower goal,
we'll surely need a password.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.110
Or something like that.
Believe it!

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.550
What difference does it make?

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.550
If you don't know the content,
there's no use making a fake!

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.390
Man, here I was wondering what
you were going to say, looking all big…

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.730
You're an idiot who just can't
think through things.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.760
B-But…

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.800
What if we could predict the content…?

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.540
This Earth scroll…

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.940
You wouldn't…

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.710
I'm going to…open this scroll!

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.840
No!

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.510
You! Have you forgotten
even the rules, you idiot?

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.750
We were told not to look inside the scrolls
until arriving at the tower, right?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.050
But, at this rate,
we’ll be in a hot spot, right?

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.020
There might be a trap or something.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.960
Carefully… Be careful.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560
Yeah.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.560
I know…

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.570
Hey, what's wrong?

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.970
Hey!

00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:59.540
What's wrong?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.610
What happened?!

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.550
Hey!

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.190
Hey! 					Answer me!

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.330
You'd best not do it.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.600
An enemy?

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.810
Man, you're beyond saving…

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.150
That was close.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.480
W-We're sorry.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.160
Those who ignored the rules are forced
into the situation of having to retire.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.230
In the previous exam, hypnotism
Jutsu Formula was set up to

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.460
get into the eyes of those who looked
at the scroll along the way.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.640
A measure to get them to lie
in the forest until the end of the exam.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.010
By the way…

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.110
If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.140
What're you doing hanging
around here alone?

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.850
It's not that I'm after your scroll.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.220
I didn't think so.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.820
If that was your intention…
you could've taken it from Naruto just now.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.860
So you're also after the Heaven scroll?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.060
No.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.490
I already have them both.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.200
See?

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560
What?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.870
Things led to things…

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.900
I was hurrying over to
the vicinity of the tower

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.600
to wait for my estranged companions.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.570
Now, if you'll excuse me…

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.080
Wait!

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:17.650
Fight me.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:24.460
Lucky!

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.560
Fight you, you say?

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.560
S-Sasuke.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.690
This idiot-suke.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.400
What are you saying suddenly?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.930
Are you serious?

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.640
Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.410
Hey, Sasuke!
Kabuto saved us!

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.140
Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.180
Shut up!

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.550
Sasu…ke.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.550
It can't be helped.
I said it before, too.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.560
This is all that can be done
to survive through this forest now.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.560
Hmm…That's a lie.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.390
A lie?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.000
Your heart isn't totally in this
as much as you're saying.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.110
If you could really become
serious about this exam…

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.010
Why is it necessary to fight me?

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.850
You should jump on me
at my unguarded moment,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.620
without going to
the trouble of announcing it.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.250
That's…a Ninja.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.260
Hmm, that's profound.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.560
I don't dislike that side of you.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.570
So I shall tell you the way you should go.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.670
However…let's talk as we move.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.140
The smell of broiled fish in the fire smoke
had reached a great distance.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.540
At this rate, we'll be marked
by fierce animals…and enemies.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.550
Humph!

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.560
Are there really still enemies around?

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.630
Yes, no mistake.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.600
If you think about it a little,
you'll understand.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.470
Do you know the cleverest way
of fighting in battles

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.070
in jungles and
expansive forests such as this?

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.540
No.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.140
The tower located in the center
of this forest,

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.350
the common goal for us test-takers.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.320
That means when the last day
of the test is here…

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.550
the area near that tower is
the easiest place to gather scrolls.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.560
Oh, I see. 					Ambush, right?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.190
In other words, we go after the scrolls
of the teams

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.230
that have both the Heaven and Earth scrolls
and are setting out for the tower.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.570
That's one-third of the answer.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.570
What?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.600
I mean that you guys are
not the only ones thinking that!

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.540
Near the tower, the same badgers
have probably already set traps, so…

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.610
I see!

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.880
That means there are lots of enemies
lying in wait to engage us.

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.320
Heh, having a handicap
gets me pumped, I say!

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.590
I'm looking forward to it!

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.260
If we just beat them all and
get the Heaven scroll,

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.560
we'll all survive the second exam!

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.260
No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.560
What's the remaining
one-third of the answer?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.570
The collectors who are certain
to appear during an exam of this nature.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.400
Collectors?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.010
In this exam, with the tower
just a stone's throw away,

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.010
you definitely can't rest easy…

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.540
Those particular conditions
are what create them.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.810
In other words,
those who gather extra scrolls…

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.820
as compensation for sparing them
when coming across an unexpected enemy.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:48.560
Also, those who get information to
proceed favorably through later exams

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.560
by providing the lacking scrolls to
comrades sharing the same village.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.530
And those who are thinking of,
under conditions favorable to them,

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.440
annihilating the powerful ones who
will probably get through to the third exam.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.180
It goes without saying,
but these guys are quite the big guns

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.950
and the worst enemies who
are definitely not conceited.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.250
I see.

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.250
I understand the reason
why you appeared before us.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.560
You're scared, too, right?

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.560
That's right.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.300
Now then, the tower has finally
come into view.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.170
From here on is the hard part.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.540
All right, let's go!

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.140
An enemy already?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.140
There!

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.560
Oh, it's just a centipede.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.430
Yikes! It's huge.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.560
All those legs are gross.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.000
Naruto.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.000
Huh?

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.300
I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds and
careless actions from here on.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:07.140
Huh?

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.540
Rushing ahead through a dense forest
making noise like an elephant

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.980
is the same as serving notice
in a loud voice that we're coming.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.150
We'd definitely receive
an enthusiastic welcome.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.850
O-Oh, I see.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.560
As long as time allows, we should
go slowly while remaining hidden.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.560
– Yeah. 					– Okay.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.390
Sure.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.470
Heh, not bad, everyone.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.150
Oh?

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.560
Okay, it's this way.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.120
Is it a trap?

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.890
Yeah.  It'll get intense ahead from here on.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.710
Kabuto!

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.540
H-Huh?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.450
That was close, Naruto.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.380
Substitution Jutsu!

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.320
I told you, it would get intense ahead
from here on.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.160
I've…had it…

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.270
Oh! Sakura!

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.070
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.110
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.640
Here we can see it right
in front of our eyes.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.280
Strange…

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.010
No mistake about it.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:33.750
It seems that we're already
within the enthusiastic welcome.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.550
Take a look at that.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.560
Oh, that can't be!

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.360
What on earth is going on?

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.000
No way!

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.730
Is it Genjutsu…?

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.430
So it seems.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.740
We were lured in perfectly.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.470
It appears we were
meticulously careful,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.080
and were made to walk around
the same place in a circle.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.250
We're being watched…

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.650
Probably.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.150
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.420
catch us unprepared
when we're bone-tired.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.560
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.360
Then... they'll be coming soon.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.710
They’ve appeared.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.140
Hah!

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.310
This is the perfect handicap.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.260
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:31.500
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:41.010
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:49.390
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:56.330
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.100
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.730
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:12.580
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:18.150
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.520
Just sing.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:31.760
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.100
The two are one

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.080
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.550
What's with these guys?

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.520
Crawling out all of a sudden?

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.550
Fighting in numbers isn't necessarily
a good thing, you know?

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:57.950
Since it's come to this,

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.860
it'll be a comparison of
the number of Clone Jutsu.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.560
I can get twice of twice of
twice of twice of your...

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.400
Anyway, I'll multiply
to an incredible number!

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.570
It doesn't matter if it's
your Genjutsu or whatever.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.530
I'll kick all their butts!

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.670

Mine are Better than Yours!"
