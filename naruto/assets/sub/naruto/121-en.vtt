00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.980
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.190
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.350
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.940
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.980
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.480
Where’s the other one?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.020
Hey…

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.890
Who are you looking for?

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.350
I’ll take care of the rest.
Go wash your eyes in that river.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.730
This is my ability…
specializing in assassination, of course.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.480
You can’t beat me by just having
a good nose and nails…

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.270
You can’t beat my ability!

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.560
Akamaru… I’m sorry…

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.440
Akamaru…
We’ve always done things together.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.730
We were together
whenever and wherever.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.400
However this one time, I’m sunk.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.810
My cells can swim inside
your body as I wish,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.600
and I can even create parts
that are only you.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.400
In other words,
a little bit of a fusion condition…

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.890
a sharing of the flesh is what it’ll be.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.380
A sharing…?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.890
That’s right!

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.270
And a cruel way of killing
that only I can accomplish…

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.900
the gradual scraping off
of just your cells!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.810
I see…

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560
If that’s the case…!

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.890
If I do this…
what’s gonna happen?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.900
Suicide?! That’s ridiculous!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.940
Die with me…

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.150
To Each His Own Battle

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.480
What are you thinking?!

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.810
It’s just as I thought…
We are sharing one body, right?

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.060
Damn it!

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.350
Entering my opponent’s body
to avoid any attacks…

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.690
that is my Jutsu’s greatest advantage.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.100
There hasn’t been
a single one before now

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.650
who’s done this sort of thing.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.350
Are you in pain?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.560
All right then, let’s get comfortable now.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.890
Yikes, you idiot! 					Stop it!

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.440
It’s too late!

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.480
There’s not enough blood…

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.060
Damn!

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:44.890
Damn…

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.400
Where’d he go?

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.190
So he left his little dog behind
and fled.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.890
It’s the right decision,
but he’s more cold-hearted than me.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:22.400
What?!

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.890
It couldn’t be!

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.190
What a relief…
He’s still breathing.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.810
What a relief!

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.900
Akamaru… You really gave it your best.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.310
Because of you, I was able to hold up
the enemy for a while.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.690
We’ve caused injuries
upon the enemy too.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.190
It’s enough… You’ve done enough.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.480
His name is Akamaru.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.270
Huh?

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.520
Mom… Sis…

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.900
From today, you’ll take care of him…
Okay?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.100
I will?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.400
I’m Kiba. Nice to meet you, Akamaru.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.890
You!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.890
We’ve been together forever.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.650
Nice catch, Akamaru!

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.890
All right, you did well!

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.020
Here we go!

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.480
Be more serious about it!

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.890
Stop being such a baby!

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.350
Mom…

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.980
Listen, Kiba…

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.850
It’s not just you.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.310
Akamaru and you,

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.520
the two of you need
to become strong together.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.810
With Akamaru… Together?

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.560
Akamaru…

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.150
That’s right.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.060
Way to go Akamaru! You did it!

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.600
Mid-air Dynamic Marking!

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.100
Next is mid-air triple somersault!
Take your aim!

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.890
Yahoo!

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.100
Yahoo!

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.600
We’ll be together forever
from now on too…

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.850
I’ll protect you from now on!

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:47.690
That jerk!

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.890
Setting up a trap on me!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.980
I’ll kill you!

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.980
Hey! Sakon! Where are you?! Sakon!

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.520
Sakon!

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.730
Sakon!

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.890
Blah blah blah.
You’re such a nuisance, Big Brother.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.890
Your yelling stings my eyes…

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.440
Big Brother!

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.900
I’ll kill him… is what I’d like to do,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.890
but it’s almost time for my sleep.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.890
Capture those bastards alive in my place.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.520
When I wake up,
I’ll kill them.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.100
All right, Sakon?
Capture them alive…

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.440
Yeah, I got it…

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:56.890
But…

00:11:57.890 --> 00:11:59.890
The killing part,
we’ll do it together.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.190
If I carelessly attack,

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.560
he dodges
and I end up attacking myself!

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:07.770
Behold!

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.270
Willow Dance!

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.480
You!

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.230
Bones?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.770
This is my…Kekkei Genkai.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.810
What’s with this guy…?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.400
Is he attacking with bones sticking out
from all over his body?

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.770
He’s grabbed his own bone!

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.150
It’ll be soon…

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.150
He’s turning the bone…
into a sword!

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.890
It’s futile. It’s not just ordinary bone.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.350
The highest density bone is hard as steel.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.890
So what?! I’ll break that bone!

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.020
I possess Five Dances.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.480
You’d better not think
you know my strength after just this much.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.480
What?!

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.190
I’ll specially show you…

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.400
the Camellia Dance next .

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.600
Come!

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.100
I’ll crush you!

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.940
I did it!

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:47.560
It’s a Substitution?!

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440
There!

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.310
Damn!

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.060
They’re getting closer and closer.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.650
Damn!

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.520
This isn’t good, traces of blood!

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.480
Damn, I did save Akamaru
for the time being,

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.600
but maybe I went too far.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.890
This smell…
What does it mean?

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:01.690
Why… Why is it that even those guys
are headed to a place like this?!

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.270
I don’t understand anymore.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.810
In any case,
we need to leave this place quickly.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.940
I can’t…

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.060
I’m starting to feel light-headed
from the pain and loss of blood…

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.650
My body won’t move at all either…

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.890
Akamaru…

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.890
He left just his coat…

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.890
Huh?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.890
So he fled by floating down the river…

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.940
Damn!

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.890
Damn!

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.810
Damn…

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:32.890
This is it!

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.890
So, I’ve cornered you, you stinking rat!

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.890
Pretty impressive…

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.520
You timed it well to scatter
the three to attack.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.310
You must have practiced quite a bit, huh?

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.850
Since it’s a pretty complicated song…

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.520
Well now…

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.890
Not only did you
immediately understand

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.520
that I’m manipulating these guys
with my flute,

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.150
you understood how difficult this song is.
You’re a pretty impressive punk.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.980
But you can’t completely
understand this song.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:17.270
You're so right…
since art is so foreign to me.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.770
But since she uses that flute
to manipulate,

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.940
it means that song must contain
individually specific sound patterns

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.520
to control each and every movement
of those guys.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.900
I’m pretty confident
when it comes to just analyzing,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.230
but this time it’s not looking good.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.520
The reason is that

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.690
I don’t understand
musical notes whatsoever.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.730
There’s no one that’s heard
this song and lived.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.850
Finale, Ninth Passage,
Demon Revolution!

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.730
The melody’s changed!

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.060
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.190
And you smiled

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.850
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.600
In my own words

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:41.150
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.810
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:52.400
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:58.060
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:04.350
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:11.440
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.690
I feel so sad

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.650
But…

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.980
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.020
And you smiled

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.890
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.890
In my own words

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.400
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.650
And you smiled

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.060
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.020
In my own words

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:42.810
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:54.890
Attacks and defense without gaps
using three Summoned bodies.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.060
I hate to admit, but she may
be a pretty good Shogi player.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.270
Plus I don’t have much Ninja tools left…

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.890
Man, it feels like I’m playing
without rooks or bishops.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:06.810
Now then…shall I go?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.730
Cry or laugh,
I can only give it my all here!

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:15.560
Next time,
“Fakeout: Shikamaru’s Comeback!”
