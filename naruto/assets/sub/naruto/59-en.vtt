WEBVTT

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:09.650
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.900
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.190
One more time

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.900
Are you really happy

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.440
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.150
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.820
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.440
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.690
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.770
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.770
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.900
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770
One more time

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.770
Tomorrow, huh…

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.770
The Final Rounds:
Rush to the Battle Arena!

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.360
What’s up? It’s been a while.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.320
Heh-heh…
I was kind of in the hospital.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.400
The hospital?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.770
I’m totally fine, now.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.770
Nothing to it!

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.940
I see.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.070
Ayame!

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.770
Yes!

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.280
Here you go.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.400
Pops?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.150
Just eat it.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.730
The final round is tomorrow, right?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.610
Okay, then.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.320
Thanks!

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.690
You’ve got a daughter at home,
so it’s not so bad, right?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.900
Most of my money vanishes
with the food expenses.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.770
Moron. Your home is special, right?

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.730
Huh?

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.440
Girls are a drag.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.770
Yeah. There are times when I really
don’t get how to act with her.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.770
Father’s have it rough…

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.770
Hah, am I the only bad guy?

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.650
Hey, master.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.530
Let me have everything
on these two pages, too!

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.770
Welcome!

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.820
Oh! Strong reinforcements!

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.770
Come on. You order something, too!

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.770
Hey…Dad.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.110
Hmm?

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.400
Hey! Let’s go home, already!

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.770
Excuse me?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.900
Shut up. You’re supposed to
live it up at a festival!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.230
Festival, my butt…

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.900
What a drag.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.070
You idiot… Since olden times…

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.820
the final round’s
been like a festival!

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.770
I’m in that final round tomorrow.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.820
Jeez, don’t make come to get you.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.480
You’re…in it?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.230
Please, Dad…

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.770
Tomorrow, eh…

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.530
Yeah.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.690
Tomorrow…is a full moon…

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.690
To think you didn’t even
get a scratch…

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.820
Perfect, eh, Neji?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.440
That’s enough warm-up exercise…

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.690
Shall we get going?

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.610
I was nervous and couldn’t sleep.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.770
First…it’s him…
in the first match.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.770
Quite honestly…even my Sharingan
can’t see through his Tenketsu!

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.820
The strongest man in the
Leaf is on my team.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.820
It is that…Neji Hyuga!

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.480
Neji…Neji…Neji…

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.320
At last…

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.940
The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.650
Yeah. He’s the number one rookie
from last year, right?!

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.650
We can’t miss the first match!

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.230
Neji…Hyuga…

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.820
Now I can summon a frog…
lt’ll be okay.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.770
They all…look nasty.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.150
Hinata!

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.770
Yipes! N-N-Naruto.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.360
W-What are you doing here?

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.440
Today is the final round, isn’t it?

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.190
I… Just something…

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.610
I came to check out this training field.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.280
This is the place where
I became Genin, so…

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.190
Really? W-Why?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.770
N-Nothing…That doesn’t matter!

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.190
Y-You’re right. I’m sorry.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:26.610
Say, Hinata…

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.940
Neji’s a relative of yours, right?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.320
Y-Yes.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.280
Is he really strong …?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.190
Yes…

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.190
I see.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.400
B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.150
Yeah. I’m strong, after all!

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.440
I bet you can win, Naruto.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.480
What?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.030
You know…

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.770
I…when you cheered for me,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.770
I felt like I was able to become
stronger than before.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.070
Hinata! Hang tough!

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.770
When the preliminaries ended,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.770
I became able to like
myself just a little.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.860
I'll…

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.360
stand…

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.770
by my own…

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.360
words.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.770
That is my way of Ninja.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.770
From someone else's standpoint,
it might not look like anything’s changed…

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.110
but I feel like I was able to change.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:57.070
I’ve been thinking that it was…
thanks to you, Naruto.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.480
Say, Hinata…

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.360
Did you really think so?

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.480
What?

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.730
I may look strong to you,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.530
but all I do is mess up…

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.610
And I act tough because
I’m frustrated.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.110
It’s not like that!

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.770
Even when you messed up,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.770
in my view…you were always
a proud failure.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.110
W-When I look at you,
it impacts my heart.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.770
You’re not perfect, so…

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320
So…

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.980
It’s because you mess up…

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.770
that you have the strength
to rise up from that.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.780
I think such strength is
true strength.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.780
I…I think you’re an
incredibly strong person.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.110
Thanks, Hinata!

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.150
Even though I was always
the bottom one…

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.940
I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.860
I was depressed,
which was totally not my character.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.770
But I feel better now!

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:30.980
Naruto…

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.110
Okay! I’m off to the match!

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.770
Hinata…

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.820
Huh?

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.780
I kind of…thought you were…

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.780
W-What…?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.780
…gloomy, hesitant and weird.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.770
Naruto…

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.190
But I quite like…people…

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.980
like you!

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.610
…like you!

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.770
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch me
kick that Neji’s butt!

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.770
Uh-oh. Time to run!

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.230
I-I’m late, late!

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.650
See you later, Hinata!

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.190
Sorry I’m late, Hinata.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.770
Well, Shino’s match isn’t until
quite a bit later, so…

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.770
Hm? Hey? Hinata?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.900
Hmm? W-What?

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.230
Oh, it’s starting!

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.230
Move, move!

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.730
C'mon, move!

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.320
Dang it! There’s quite a distance!

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.730
I won’t make it!

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.610
Brother Naruto!

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.280
Konohamaru?!

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.190
I’ve come to aid in brother’s crisis, here!

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.780
Konohamaru…
What’re you doing here?!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.820
I’ll tell you later!

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.980
This way, here!

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.770
There’s an ace shortcut where
you can get straight to the arena, here!

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.320
What?!

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.230
All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.190
Those who control the
secret path control time.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.280
Oh, I see!
You’re awesome, Konohamaru!

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:53.610
As I recall, there’s a hole
in the wall around here…

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.770
Oh!

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.030
Here it is!

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.770
Oh!

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.980
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.860
The secret path has been repaired, here!

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.400
Whaat…?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.900
Oh! There’s no time!

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:10.940
Brother!

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.570
Next approach!

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.690
Look! I’m really out of time.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.730
It’s a secret, but there’s
an awesome path

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.820
that can get you inside the arena
in an instant, here!

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.320
What?! All right!
Well done, Konohamaru!

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.980
This hole is a shortcut?

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.730
It’s a straight shot to
the final round arena!

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.440
No doubt, here!

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.480
Straight shot, huh? 					Okay!

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.360
Let’s hurry!

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.400
Yeah!

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.940
Konohamaru!
What’s happening here?!

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.570
It’s okay, here!

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.770
We’re almost to the final
round arena, here!

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.070
See? There’s the exit, here!

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.280
Oh, oh.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.820
What?!

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.440
Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.780
T-This is…some kind of mistake!

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.770
Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.820
What the heck are you doing?!

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.400
We’ve gotten further
and further away!

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.320
Until just recently,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.820
it was connected to the
final round arena, here.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.480
Next approach, right away…

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.320
This is it!

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.780
If you ride this, you’ll get to the
final round arena just like that, here!

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.030
Huh? A bull?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.610
Think again, brother.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.480
A feudal lord Bull is not at all in
the same league as ordinary cows, here.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.980
Once they start running,
even race horses grow deathly pale.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.770
There’s no way they can beat
a no-nonsense feudal lord cow!

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.280
Anyway, it’s an awesome cow!

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.530
Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:21.940
it’s just a short run to
the final round arena, here!

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.280
Then, I’m counting on you.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.070
Okay, let’s go!

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:32.820
Huh? Wha--?!

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.650
Ouch!

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.770
What?

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.770
Brother, go for it, here!

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.820
Hey! Stop! Stop!

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.650
Hey-hey, we’re missing quite
a few people.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.770
What’s going on?
lt’s going to start.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.690
What’s the meaning of this?
Sasuke…?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.980
And even Naruto…

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.940
Why is it?!

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.320
This is bad!

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:00.770
That's it!

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.770
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.030
Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.770
– Yeah! 					– Yeah!

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.320
What’s wrong with you guys?
Why are you back, hey?!

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.480
More appeared!

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.730
The escape path was blocked!

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.900
It won’t do any good to multiply!

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.770
Hmm? What the--?!

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.530
Naruto Uzumaki…?

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.770
We leave the rest to you!

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.570
Whoa, let us in, quick!

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.770
Hey!

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.400
Entry has already…!

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.770
What kind…of entrance is
this kid making…?

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.070
Naruto.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.780
He’s totally late.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.940
What a drag.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:24.770
Guys, run! A large herd of
stampeding bulls is coming.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.650
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.530
Jeez! I’m serious.
So many of them…!

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.480
Huh? Hey… 					Where's Sasuke?

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.650
The Dosu guy I’m supposed
to fight isn’t here, either.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.440
Hey, you guys there.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.280
Don’t be restless.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.820
Throw out your chests and
show your faces to the spectators!

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.650
You guys are the stars of
this “final round.”

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.770

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.070

randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

but hates curry

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.820
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:45.360
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:52.730
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.570
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:09.780

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.320
Hey Hinata!

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.280
Keep your eyes open and watch me
defeat this unpleasant guy!

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.400
He goes and decides that
a person's life path can't be changed…

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.780
Destiny is decided when one is born?
Don't kid me!

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.570
People definitely can change.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.900
By defeating this guy,
I'll prove that!

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.570
Next time,
 "Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone"

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.070
Quit gabbing
and let's get started!
