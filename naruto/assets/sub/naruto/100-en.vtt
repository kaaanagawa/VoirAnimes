WEBVTT

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.480
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.980
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.190
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.600
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.600
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.270
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.100
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.400
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.770
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.060
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.230
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.350
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.940
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.440
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.270
– Good-bye, Sensei.
– Yay! School's out!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.480
Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.890
Good-bye!

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.480
Make sure you practice what
I taught you today, Transform Jutsu!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.690
And tell your family about tomorrow’s
inauguration for the Fifth Hokage!

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.400
– Okay! 					– Okay.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.980
Konohamaru!

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940
What is it, Iruka Sensei?

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.560
Well…it’s all right.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.400
See you tomorrow!

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.940
Okay… Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.060
It looks like he got over it.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.520
Hey, Lee!

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.980
On your way back from rehabilitation?

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.100
Um…yes…

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.230
I hope you get better soon.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.650
Thank you very much.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.900
To activate each and
every cell all at once…

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.980
If it were just one by one,
it’d be a snap,

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.980
but all of them together
is gonna be tough.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.310
Still…

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.440
The Leaf Village is
in great trouble right now,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.770
so we must do our best!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.890
I think if you had Lady Tsunade take
a look, you'd get better very quickly.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.890
It's better that you give up being
a Shinobi and look for a different path.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.150
Sensei and Student:
The Bond of the Shinobi

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.600
Clone Jutsu!

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.900
Transformation Jutsu!

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.270
Hey, young kid…

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.520
The medal of youth is one of passion,
with no looking back!

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.440
If you work hard at it,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.310
I’m telling you, son,
you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.230
Who is he?
He is pretty overbearing.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.980
Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth…

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.940
Well then, adieu.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.520
That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.100
And then…

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.900
Today, you have all become Genin.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.690
I want to hear what
your goals are for the future.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.190
I don’t want to answer.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.810
I-I…!

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.190
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.650
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.230
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.810
Those are good serious eyes…

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.730
You! What's so funny?!

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.150
I'm serious!

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.270
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.060
Don’t you realize that
if you can’t use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.890
you’re not a Ninja in the first place?

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.060
Don’t you remember being told
that you’re the first person

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.440
to graduate from the academy
who’s only able to use Taijutsu ?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.690
It’s not because you’re so good;
it’s just that you’re unusual.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.560
W-Why--!

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.400
Listen up! If you have passion,
it’s not necessarily so.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.690
If you act with passion,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.560
compete with good rivals
and lift each other up,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.730
you can all become great Ninja!

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.150
But you know,
you have to work hard!

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.890
Passion…

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.350
I…was inspired by Guy Sensei.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.100
By his words…and his deeds.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.770
You’re late!
17 minutes and 32 seconds late!

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.890
Let’s not do it today, all right?

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.890
Each of us has 48 wins!

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.650
With a win today,
one of us will pull ahead!

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.060
I guess you won't give up
even if I say I wouldn’t want to do it.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.890
It’s my turn to choose the event, right?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.900
Right! What’s it gonna be?

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.520
A Taijutsu battle? A 100-meter dash?

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.940
Holding our breath under water?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.020
I don’t care, we could even
have an eating contest…

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.850
Please…

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:22.900
Okay, then…

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.020
Wh-What?!

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.690
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.690
Rock, paper, scissors?
That’s what you choose?

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.190
They say that your luck is
one part of your skill, don’t they?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.890
Plus, it’s a great competition
for testing your observational reflexes…

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.060
R-Right.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.690
Do you get the feeling
Kakashi’s just playing around with Guy

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.350
‘cuz he can't be bothered?

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.900
That’s what it looks like to me.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.600
I accept the battle.
There’s no way I’m gonna lose!

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.600
If I do, I’ll walk around the Leaf Village
500 times on my hands!

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.890
There you go again…

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.890
I promise!

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.560
Here we go…

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.020
Another one of your special,
self-imposed rules.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.060
He can’t do that.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.940
That’s ridiculous.
He’s acting like a kid.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.060
Yeah, that’s impossible,
even for Guy Sensei.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.100
Impossible? Reckless, I’d say!

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.810
– Rock, paper…!
– Rock, paper…!

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.810
Here you are.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.190
Guy Sensei?

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.230
How did you know I was here?

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.850
I know everything about you.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.230
I heard that you skipped out
on rehabilitation these past two days?

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.690
You can’t be doing that!

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.100
When I first became Genin…

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.850
this is where I revealed
my dream, my aspiration.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.890
Neji laughed at me then,
but I meant what I said.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.190
I'd like to prove that
I could become a splendid Ninja

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.650
even though I can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.400
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.020
At that time, you told me…

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.810
If you act with passion,
compete with rivals,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.890
you can become a fine Ninja.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.940
And that…

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.730
In order to do that, it’d take “effort.”

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.980
I was happy to hear that.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.890
– Transform! 					– Transform!

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.730
Because while at the academy…

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.400
no one, not one friend or teacher,
said that kind of thing to me.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.980
You put me at ease…

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.890
You opened up a path
just when I was unsure of myself.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.890
I realized all I had to do
was try my best.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.890
And when I complained that

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.020
all my efforts couldn’t match
the others’ natural talents,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.400
you told me that I had
a natural talent for effort.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:39.940
That was when I learned the importance
of believing in my own strength.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.890
The chance of a successful surgery
is probably 50%, at best.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.810
But…this is one time…
even if I try my best…!

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.150
and even if I believe in myself,
there’s nothing in the world I can do!

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.600
Guy Sensei… Please tell me…!

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.350
Please tell me.
Can I become like you?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.150
Why did this kind of thing
happen only to me?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.890
Because I have my own
Way of Ninja to follow,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.480
my own dreams and aspirations
that I have to protect and

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.890
prove to the world even
if it means dying for…

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.600
What should I do?!

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.890
The Eight Inner Gates…

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.900
Is this the Forbidden Jutsu that
will destroy the body of the practitioner?

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.270
Please tell me!

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.770
I’m prepared for the worst.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.900
Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.890
Everything is…for my dream!

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.230
That means everything to me!

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.940
You tried to become a great Ninja
relying only on Taijutsu…

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.230
Until now, that’s all you had.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.890
It must be so painful for you…

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.890
Now that it seems that your dreams

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.270
and all your wishes
are being cruelly taken away.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.850
It does not matter what his wishes are,
he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.650
Lee…

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:42.850
If you want to be free of that pain,
you have to prepare yourself!

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.770
Does it mean…
to prepare to give up my dreams?

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.230
If you lose your dreams,

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.810
you will undergo pain even greater
than what you feel now.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.190
Neither you nor I would be able to
go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.890
What fools we are…

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.810
Lee! Have the surgery!

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.890
How’s it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.060
It’s all about the Chakra, but…

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:39.100
There are so many kinds of cells…

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.060
skin cells, internal organ cells,
muscular cells…

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.890
You know, it’s just a tad difficult
to activate all of them at once.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.810
What’s that?
“Just a tad,” you say?

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.730
Are you testing me?

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.890
Oh no!

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.890
I’m declaring my trust in you.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.890
I don’t know why,
but just a while ago…

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.810
I was remembering the time
when you and Kakashi Sensei

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.690
were competing
with rock, paper, scissors.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.060
At that time, Kakashi Sensei said

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.020
that your luck is
one part of your skill, right?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.940
This surgery is also fifty-fifty,
live or die…

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.890
But…

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.270
it’s not a game of
rock, paper, scissors!

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:46.150
Do you remember what happened
after that, Lee?

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.100
500 times around…
lt’s a promise! Yay!

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.730
What's he doing?!

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:29.730
Shoot!

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.440
If I lose, I’ll walk 500 times
around the Leaf Village, on my hands!

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:40.890
It's a promise!

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.310
He can’t do that! That’s stupid.
He’s acting like a kid.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.310
Hah! This is nothing!

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.980
Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.890
Why are you doing this?

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.690
Kakashi Sensei is not here.
ln fact, no one is watching.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.230
When a man stands cool with
a Nice-guy pose in front of others,

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:27.350
he should keep his promise,
even if it kills him!

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.980
It’s a promise!

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.270
What?

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.270
Why do you always do that?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.890
Whenever you’re about to start
doing something,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.560
why do you always come up
with some kind of crazy rule.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.890
Good question, Lee.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.730
You really know how
to get to the point.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.060
OK, I’ll tell you.
But remember, you can’t tell anyone else.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:58.890
What’s the answer?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.890
Making self-rules is nothing less than
a practice which brings me victory!

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.400
S-Self-rules…?

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:10.810
Are you ready?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.440
The point of these rules is that,
when you’re going after something,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.440
they push you into a real tough spot…

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.730
It’s about chaining yourself down.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.770
For example, on the other side
of the hellish rule that

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.520
“If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,
I’ll do 500 laps” is the idea that

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.890
“If I do 500 laps,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.900
there’s no way I won’t be able
to beat Kakashi next time.”

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.890
They hold power,
the potential of the heavens.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.270
Y-Yes…

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.480
By being chained down
to doing 500 laps,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.770
it makes you get serious.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.900
Even about things like
rock, paper, scissors competitions,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.810
which are so trifling otherwise.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.100
And, even if you lose,
walking around the village 500 times

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.350
give you the benefit
of extremely intense training.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.890
I see!

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.400
OK, I’ve gotta do a little more.
Here we go!

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.810
I’m going with you!
I have my own “self-rule” which is--

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.890
Hey! Hey! Don’t push yourself, Lee.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.890
If I can’t keep up with you, I'll…

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.150
try even harder!

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.890
That is, I’ll aim to be like you.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.690
And if I keep trying,
I’ll be able to become a great Ninja!

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.810
All right! If that’s the case,
then I have an addition to my rule!

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.690
If you can’t keep up with me
all the way to the end…

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.100
I’ll put every ounce of
my being into training you!

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.190
If I train you with all my being,
you’ll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:46.270
I promise!

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.190
Huh, that’s right.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.940
That was the first time you told me about
the "self-rule," wasn’t it?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.600
Your surgery will be a success

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.400
because you have worked hard
all the way through.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.270
You have the power to bring
your own future in the heavens.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.440
And in the one in a thousand…

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.890
no, one in a million chance
that something goes wrong…

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.650
I will die with you!

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.900
Ever since I met you,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.810
my Way of Ninja has been to
nurture you into a fine Ninja.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:35.890
I promise you!

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:44.850
Neither you nor I would be able
to go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.400
What fools we are…

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.810
G-Guy Sensei!

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.480
OK, let’s go, Lee!

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.850
Yes, sir!

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.150
Lady Tsunade!

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.600
From this day forward,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.690
I am the ruler of the Village Hidden
in the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.270
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.770
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.890
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.560
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:44.060
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.890
That hold us together

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:58.690
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.350
you say laughingly

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.230
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.150
Like a comet,

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:18.350
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:25.560
You bring light into my heart

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:35.890
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:44.850
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.890
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.520
Darn! He has no hole
in his defense.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.310
Being impatient won't
do any good, Naruto.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.890
Let's utilize the next mission.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.440
That's right. The next mission
requires an overnight stay.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.890
– Our chance will be at the inn.
– Roger that!

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.480
Once we get to the inn,
we'll wait until he's defenseless…

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.190
– and then… 					– and then…

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.940
– unmask him at once!
– unmask him at once!

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.770
Next time: "Gotta See! Gotta Know!
Kakashi Sensei's True Face!"

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:16.890
'Cuz we're really curious!
