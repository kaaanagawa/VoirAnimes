WEBVTT

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.130
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.630
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.260
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.260
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.260
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.920
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.760
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.050
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.420
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.720
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.300
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.880
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.380
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.010
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.590
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.300
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.720
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.090
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.420
Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.300
Oh! Dad!

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.090
This isn’t good!

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.300
Oh no, Gamatatsu!
Let’s get out of here!

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.460
What? Why, why?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.380
It doesn’t matter, just hurry up!

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.630
Manda and Orochimaru,
Katsuyu and Tsunade…

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.460
They all bring back memories…

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.460
Shall we have a reunion
or something, Jiraiya?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.130
Fool! I summon you after a long absence

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.460
and you make these boring jokes.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.720
The time to conclude this long,
fateful confrontation has come.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.670
I'm bringing Orochimaru down,
here and now!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.170
Hey Orochimaru…

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.880
Why'd you have to summon me
to a place like this?!

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.090
You… I’m going to eat you up!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.460
Don’t say that, Lord Manda…

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.460
You will be duly rewarded.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.460
Who said I'm talking to you?!

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.550
Don’t be so flippant, brat!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.460
Hey, Orochimaru…

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.050
I expect you to prepare
a sacrificial offering of 100 people later.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.050
Though Lord Orochimaru is
Manda’s master,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.590
if Manda learns that Lord Orochimaru
can’t use Jutsu,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.970
Manda will no doubt
double-cross him.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.460
Despite the fact that he had
no other choice, in his condition,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.010
it was too risky for Lord Orochimaru
to summon Manda.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.630
Katsuyu… take that kid to Shizune!

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.880
Yes, ma’am.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.800
All right! I can fight, too!

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.050
Shizune, please take care of this child.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.460
Naruto…

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.880
Also, the battle is going to get
quite vicious from now.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.130
Please go far away with my clone
and conceal yourself…

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.300
That’s what Lady Tsunade wants.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.340
Lady Tsunade…

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.130
You…

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.460
I’ll hang you out until you’re dry!

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.460
I’ve been wanting a snakeskin wallet…

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.460
Orochimaru,
you’ve sunk too deeply into vice!

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.220
We are no longer comrades.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.720
Comrades?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.550
That word makes me shiver.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.460
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460
Acid Slime!

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.590
I’ll start with this one!

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.510
Katsuyu!

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.670
Lady Tsunade…

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.720
Here they come!

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.010
I know!

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.880
Tsunade! Stay away!

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.460
Bunta! Give me some oil!

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.260
Okay!

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.380
Fire Style!

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.460
Toad Oil Flamethrower!

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.510
Humph… How’s that?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.720
Did it work?

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.260
No, that’s…

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.460
Molten skin! He shed his skin!

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.720
Bunta! Under the earth!

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.800
What?!

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.220
It’s the tail?!

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.130
Keep it shut!

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.260
They're Sannin, all right.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.340
Dealing with two of them is rough.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.800
Tsunade!

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.840
Well now, I can kill you
by wringing your neck.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:25.800
My Chakra…

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.470
At this rate…

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.920
Even though you say
you won’t die in battle,

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.460
you won't have a choice if
I rip your neck off…

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.170
Right, Tsunade?

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.260
How many minutes…

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.300
How many seconds can I hold on…?

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.260
I have to put it on the line!

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.340
Fine!

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.460
It’s about time we put an end to this!

00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:59.550
R-Ridiculous!

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.010
Not done yet!

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.010
Take this!

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.460
Darn it…!

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.880
Lady Tsunade… Not that…!

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.970
She’s reached her limit…

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.170
No…

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.460
This guy…

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.050
I’ve hurled him around that much,
yet he’s still…

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.630
So this is as far as you can go.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.380
Shut up!

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.760
Don’t rest!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.880
Keep beating him.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.720
This is the battle…

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.090
where I put my life on the line!

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.880
Lord Orochimaru!

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.590
I won’t let you go!

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.420
You will stay with me until the end!

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.880
Take this!

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.550
I hit him and hit him.
Something’s different…

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.630
What is it?
This…strange sense of discomfort?

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.550
However, with this…!

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.220
It’s over!

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.720
He took a direct hit!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.760
That was it.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.970
Yeah…

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.920
Lord Orochimaru…

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.970
Putting me in this position!

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.840
I want to eat you and kill you,

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.460
but I can’t even chew you up
with this hole in my mouth…

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.260
Next time, if we meet again,
be prepared!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.010
Tsunade…

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:32.300
Even though you won’t heal me,
I still have one way.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.460
A way to resurrect these arms.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.460
The Leaf Village…
I’ll destroy it…without fail.

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:00.460
At that time, it would be nice
if we could meet again…

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:07.460
My comrades…
Tsunade and Jiraiya.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.840
That face…?!

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.260
In some way or another,
he took someone else’s body…?!

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.550
No wonder,
when we went at it a while ago,

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.130
I didn’t get the same feeling
from him that I did in the past…

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.260
The true elixir of life.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.130
That’s my…

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.260
my immortality!

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.460
Some day, in the future…

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.130
Wait!

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.090
The bones in my ribs and feet
are broken…

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.050
The side effects of the Jutsu
are starting…

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.380
My body is…already…

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.630
Tsunade, you haven’t changed.
You’re no good at wagers.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.800
The Hokage is my dream!

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.800
I’ll give you one week.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.800
If you can master that Jutsu,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.460
I’ll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage…

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.550
and give you this necklace.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.670
It's no joke!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.300
If I have three days,
I’ll master this Jutsu!

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.220
Men don’t go back on their word!

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.130
I’m the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:11.420
You said it.
Men don’t go back on their word!

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.460
Right! I’ll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.300
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.260
I love this village and my comrades.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.590
So I want to protect them.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.090
An existence that protects everyone.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.460
Becoming the Hokage is my dream…

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.420
I’d like you… to take this.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.760
Any time now, the side effects…

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.460
Lady Tsunade…

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.920
You…

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:13.220
It's nothing… If I rest a bit, I’ll return
to my young form.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.470
I’ll rest in town.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.920
And when Naruto wakes up,
We’ll return to Konoha.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.460
Tsunade…

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.340
Starting now, don’t call me Tsunade.
Call me…

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.130
The Fifth Hokage?!

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.340
Old Lady Tsunade is
the Fifth Hokage starting today…

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.340
What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.050
After all, compared to the old man,
the Third Hokage,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.010
there’s something…

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.920
rough-natured and kind of selfish…

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.970
loose with money, catty and stupid…

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:58.590
Somehow, I’m going to worry
if she can do it properly.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.170
Lady Tsunade, would you like
to order something…

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.460
Moreover, a 50-year-old lady
transforming into a young lady…

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.460
Is it okay for the person who
will become Hokage

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.460
to lie to everyone, I wonder…?

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.720
Go outside, brat!

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.170
It’s just like before…

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.630
Despite how I look,
I’m going to be the Fifth Hokage.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.460
I shouldn’t take
this short brat of a foe seriously…

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.800
This one is enough…

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.970
Don’t call me brat!

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.090
I may be like this now,
but I’ll be Hokage some day!

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.050
Here I go!

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.380
Another brow flick?!

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.460
Become a fine man…

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.590
and, a fine Hokage.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.880
Yeah!

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.670
Okay! Shall we go home?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.300
To our hometown the Leaf Village!

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.300
What? I haven’t eaten yet…!

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.460
Don’t try to distract me by laughing!

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.380
Nawaki… Dan…

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.760
the boy who will inherit your dreams,
my beloved ones,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.220
is right here!

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.630
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:28.130
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.300
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.920
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.460
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.420
That hold us together

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:58.050
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.720
you say laughingly

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:06.590
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.510
Like a comet,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:17.720
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.920
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:35.380
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:44.220
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.300
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.800
Yahoo! Here we are
at a hot spring spot!

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.460
While Pervy Sage is gawking at women,
and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.550
I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.460
What?! Who worked over my room?!

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.170
I don't know who they are,

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.920
but I'm gonna find them
and kick their butts!

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.590
Next time: "Kidnapped!
Naruto's Hot Spring Adventure!"
