WEBVTT

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.340
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.960
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.590
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.170
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.590
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.590
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.250
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.090
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.380
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:51.750
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.050
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.630
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.210
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.710
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.340
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.920
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.630
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.210
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.420
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.790
Hey, Pervy Sage. What Jutsu are you
gonna teach me this time?

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.420
The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu,
so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.670
Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.340
Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.130
You keep calling me Pervy Sage.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.250
So you have no idea that
I’m a superb person, huh?

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.790
Huh…? A superb Pervy Sage?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.300
Nhaagh… Listen carefully!

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.790
Toad Sage is only a disguise!

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.420
As a matter of fact…!

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790
North and South and East and West!

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.920
I’m the white-maned toad charmer,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.790
and one of the legendary Sannin whom
even celestial beings can’t defeat.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.920
Such a stud!

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.920
That he strikes fear…
in the hearts of people!

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.630
I am no other than “Master Jiraiya”!

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.790
Yes… 					I’m talking about me!

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.790
Huh…

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.880
Jiraiya:
Naruto's Potential Disaster

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.750
Atafuku Town?
That’s ten kilometers from here!

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.840
It’s “O”tafuku Town!

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.960
Hey…hey… 					Hey, Pervy Sage!

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.550
I’m telling you, it’s Jiraiya.
Gimme a break…

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.800
So the fact that such
a bigwig Pervy Sage like you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.630
is taking me along as
his travel companion means…

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.790
that I’m potentially a genius?

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.250
Just as I thought!

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.420
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Why did you choose me?

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.790
A long time ago,
the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.550
And you resemble the Fourth Hokage
so much, it’s almost funny.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.880
That’s the only reason…

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.250
I…?

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.250
The Fourth Hokage…?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.050
Yeah!

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.630
Yeah! Yeah!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.170
W-What is it?

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.090
Yeah!

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.790
The fact that I resemble
the Fourth Hokage means

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.340
that I also possess genius
of his level, right?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.790
I’ll become the Hokage, after all!
All right!

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.250
W-Wait…

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.420
I stepped on some dog poop!

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.090
About the only areas you resemble
the Fourth Hokage

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.790
are your hair and your stubbornness!

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.550
What was that?!
You senile Pervy Sage!

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.460
Not again!

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.550
Sakura? Come here!

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.790
Okay!

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.790
Please take these rice sweets
over to Ino’s house.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.790
Ino’s house?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.380
These?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.590
That’s right…

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.790
Don’t bother them
by staying too long.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.790
Because everyone is
very busy at this time.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.790
I know that!

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.500
See you later!

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.790
Oh, yeah…

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.420
I’ll bring some over
to Sasuke later on too.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.460
I wonder if he likes sweets…?

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.130
And to Naruto too…

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.790
Naruto looks like
he would eat anything…

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.000
Hey Kakashi Sensei!
Teach me Chidori too!

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.380
You may say teach me,
but it’s not that easy.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.790
What the heck’s that?!

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.790
That’s not fair, show me how!
Teach it to me.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.960
Sasuke… Thank you…

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.420
You rescued me from
the Sand Ninja, right?

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.130
No…

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.340
Huh?

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.380
For a start, why don’t you try gathering
Chakra in your palms!

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.790
All right!

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.750
The person who rescued you…
was Naruto.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.670
Like this? Like this?

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.790
Oh come on, Sasuke,
you’re being overmodest again.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.250
It’s true that Naruto has gotten stronger,
but against that Sand Ninja…

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.790
I’m telling you the truth.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.920
That kid fought desperately
to rescue you.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.630
He showed a kind of strength that
he had never shown before.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.550
Naruto rescued…me.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.550
Oh, it’s coming…

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:31.920
Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.790
All right! I’ll bring some to Naruto too!

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.500
I wasn’t…
I wasn’t able to do anything…

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:05.920
I don’t want to watch a precious comrade
die right before my eyes ever again…

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.670
No matter what,
I will protect you!

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.880
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.380
Summoning Jutsu!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.840
Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.090
Compared to him, I…

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.790
While you may able to
manage against him,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.920
I couldn’t possibly…

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.630
He’s in a completely different level…

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.170
Yeah…

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.790
If we go at each other,
we’ll either both be killed or at best,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.550
kill each other simultaneously.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.130
Even if we increased the numbers,
that wouldn’t change.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.920
I didn’t expect the kid’s guard
would be a legendary Sannin.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.050
With him as the opponent…

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.710
the names of Leaf Village’s Uchiha Clan

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.790
and the Seven Ninja Swordsmen
of Mist would be tarnished.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.420
Yeah. However…

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.210
Any strong one has a weakness…

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.630
Stop! You will get cursed!

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.920
Hey, hey, Pervy Sage…

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.210
Huh?!

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.250
What kind of a student was
the Fourth Hokage?

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.000
Well, I guess one could say

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.630
that he developed to that extent
because he was my student…

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.790
You’re one lucky guy
to be taught by me!

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.840
– Hmmm… 					– Hmmm…

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.880
Are you dubious?

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.300
A good teacher will develop
good disciples.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.000
That goes without saying.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.460
Then, then, who taught you,
Pervy Sage?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.790
Me?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.500
I learned from the Third Hokage.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.800
The Third Hokage?

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.590
That’s right…

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.050
The Third Hokage was
still young and lively.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.170
– The Third Hokage…young and lively?
– The Third Hokage…young and lively?

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.210
That’s right!
I was young and lively too!

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.210
Young and lively?!

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.790
I…I got tangled up.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.590
See… You got cursed…

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.380
So you learned from Kakashi.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.500
Then you experienced
the “Bell Training,” right?

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.750
Huh…?

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.630
Yeah! I did! Yes I did!

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.790
Only I was tied to the tree trunk
and had one deuce of a time…

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.250
What? You too?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.790
Huh? What do you mean
by “you too”?

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:37.710
Huh?

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.790
What do you mean by “you too”?

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.840
Why don’t you just hurry,
get up and return those things.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.500
Even if you were to say that…
it’s pretty difficult…

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.340
There are two bells.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.670
The fact that there are
only two means…

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.790
That one of us has to go
to the tree trunk…

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.590
You’re quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.670
All right! I’ll make it!

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.130
Come at me with the intent to kill!

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.550
Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn’t I?

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.090
You got tied to the tree trunk,
after all.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.210
Shut up!

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.210
You flat-chested like a cutting board.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.790
What did you say?!
You nerdy perv!

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.790
Okay, Okay, that’s enough.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.790
Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.790
Okay!

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.000
You are hopeless…

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.790
Ninja shouldn’t be getting caught in
obvious traps like that over and over again.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.920
But…

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.250
Why don’t you learn a little
from Orochimaru?!

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.050
Sarutobi Sensei, you’re always
saying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.380
Hm?

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:10.790
When it comes to snooping,
I’m really good at Transparency Jutsu.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.790
Gimme a break…

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.750
I don’t even wanna know

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.880
what level of Transparency Jutsu
you possess…

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.790
I’ve never been caught once!
And that’s the truth!

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.460
If you’re that sure of yourself,
I’ll go with you next time…

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.630
You’re such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei…

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.750
Huh?! Huh?

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.790
What, what?

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:40.960
Hey!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.210
What’s so funny?! Pervy Sage!

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.210
Huh?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.130
It’s just as I said, a good teacher
will develop good disciples.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.550
Huh…? I don’t understand
what you’re saying!

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.300
Come on, let’s go.
Did you put it back properly?

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.050
Yeah, I fixed them!

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920
See!

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.250
It appears that they haven’t
found Naruto yet.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.380
But don’t you think that’s strange?

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.630
Those guys had already
infiltrated the village.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.630
It should be easy to find Naruto
in this village.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.550
Itachi knows Naruto’s face.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.670
Kakashi…

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.710
Why is Kakashi sleeping?

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.790
Besides, only Jonin are gathering here…

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.630
What are you doing?
What in the world happened?!

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.550
Nothing…in particular…

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.170
Is it true that that
ltachi has returned?!

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.960
And moreover,
that he’s after Naruto…?!

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.300
Oh…

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.550
Idiot…

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.790
Why does this always happen?!

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.960
So that guy returned to this village?
And moreover, he’s pursuing Naruto?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.420
What does all this mean?!

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.340
Sasuke?!

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.590
Where’s Naruto?!

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.250
Huh? I just got here too.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.500
I wanted to give Naruto…

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.790
Some sweets…?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.300
If Naruto is caught by that guy,
that will spell his end.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.840
I’m not gonna let him do that!

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.420
Hey old man!
Naruto must have come here!

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:01.090
And do you know
where he went after that?

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.210
Oh, Naruto, right…

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.250
If I remember correctly…

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.460
Master Jiraiya came here
around noon and…

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:13.000
They ate ramen together,
and he said he was going somewhere…

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.880
Where?!

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.340
Hmm…I think he said to a post station
some distance from the village…

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.880
And then he left with Master Jiraiya.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.500
Jiraiya?

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.750
Jiraiya – one of the genius Sannin.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.460
Well, in appearance,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.960
he just looks like
a big white-haired old man.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.800
Big and white-haired…

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.380
H-Hey!

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.840
Geez… If you’re gonna
ask somebody a question,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.050
it’s only polite to stay
and have a ramen or something.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.880
Candies are here.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.460
This town is pretty weird.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.000
Naruto!

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:28.880
Huh?

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.790
We’re staying here tonight!

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.800
What?! I can still walk!

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.500
A disciple should obey his master!

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.960
I just want to learn the Jutsu!

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.630
That’s what’s called a disciple!

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.790
Huh?!

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.790
Oh, oh…!

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.300
Naruto!

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.590
Yes?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.710
Here, this is the key to the room.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.250
Go to the room ahead of me,
practice Chakra,

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.790
train some and go to sleep!

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:11.750
Got it?!

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.750
What?!

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.170
“The adult world is gonna begin
from this point on”…

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.750
Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!
That’s not fair!

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.090
That post town isn’t that far…!

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.000
This! Somehow this always happens
when I’m with that Pervy Sage!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.750
Darn…

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.500
Here…

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.340
Candies are here!

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.300
I’ve got to check door by door!

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.590
Cheers!

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.800
I wonder if he really has any inclination
to oversee my training?

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.960
What about that one? Yeah that.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.960
See! A hundred out of a hundred!

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.790
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.590
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.460
This is an inn for women only…

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.250
I’m looking for someone…

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.790
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.960
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.750
Today, we only have old people.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.790
Hmm…this is kind of crisp
on the tongue…

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.790
Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.960
Do you have a blond kid with
a dumb-looking face, about my age

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.630
and a big white-haired old man
staying here?

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:00.840
White-haired…?

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.790
Are they here?!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.380
Eh…Do I remember seeing
some people like that earlier

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.550
when shifts changed…?

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:12.420
This tastes bitter…
are you all right with it? Cheers!

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.380
Oh! A blond kid and
a white-haired old man!

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.630
They’re here?!
What’s their room number!

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.840
Um…

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.840
Room number one at
the end of the hallway

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.300
on the second floor…

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.630
What’s up?
Has she already dumped you?

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.750
Okay, Okay!

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.750
Okay, Okay, I’ll open up!

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.670
Naruto!

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:58.790
It’s not him…

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.710
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.670
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:39.790
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.840
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.790
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:54.050
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:59.790
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.840
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.800
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:19.090
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.500
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:56.340
Darn it! My body is frozen!
What is this creepy feeling?

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.250
This guy is absolutely not
an ordinary person.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.500
He’s got the same Sharingan
as Sasuke.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:04.790
He’s a member of Uchiha clan.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:09.840
Is this the guy Sasuke
was talking about?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.420
Next time: “Roar, Chidori!
Brother vs. Brother!”
