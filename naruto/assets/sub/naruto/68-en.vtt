WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.770
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:18.020
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.310
One more time

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.020
Are you really happy

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.560
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.270
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.940
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.560
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.810
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.890
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.020
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.890
One more time

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.890
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.730
Zero Hour!
The Destruction of
		the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.900
Lord Hokage!

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.270
Leave it to me!

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.650
Lord Kazekage!
What is going on?

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.940
Lord Hokage!

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.690
Gaara!

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.270
Squad One, above.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.850
Squad Two, below!
Protect the lords!

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.810
You’re in the way!

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.020
Lord Hokage… 					Please…flee…

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.850
It’s finally our time to
come on the scene.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.350
We’ve been transformed
such a long time.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.060
I’m totally pent up with frustration.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.890
You guys smell all sweaty!

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.650
Come on, we’re all comrades, right…?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.100
Sound Ninja…!

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.100
Raido…

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.270
We’re heading out to
back up Lord Hokage.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.310
Be careful of any traps!

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.940
Do it…

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.890
Yes sir!

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.100
– Ninja Art! 					– Ninja Art!

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.310
– Four Flames Formation!
– Four Flames Formation!

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.890
Barrier…!

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.980
Lord Kazekage…

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.440
Barrier Ninjutsu, huh?!

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.890
To think that they could outwit Anbu…

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.020
They're not just ordinary…

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.940
What are you doing here?!
Lord Hokage is in danger!

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.310
What a nuisance…

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.190
To think that the enemy was
masquerading as our Anbu…

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.310
So it was also that guy
who used Genjutsu!

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.060
Yeah…there’s no mistake.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.810
I didn’t expect that…

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.890
Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.730
The treaty is simply a camouflage to
make the enemy let down their guard.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.060
The petty little battle game ends now.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.770
From this point on, the course
of history will change!

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.890
Are you saying that
you’re starting a war?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.190
That’s right.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.890
One should avoid resolution
through armed force

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.310
and should rather seek
a solution through negotiations.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.890
There’s still time…Lord Kazekage!

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.890
Perhaps one gets addicted to
peace as one grows older…

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.730
Sarutobi Sensei!

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.100
You’re…

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.270
Just my bad luck…

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.270
to have lookout duty
on a day like this.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.890
I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400
Stop fussing.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.890
The Chunin Exam takes
place twice a year.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.890
You’ll have many more chances
to see it.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.100
But this year, that kid from
the Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.940
And I won’t have
a chance to see that…

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.520
I won’t be able to die peacefully.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:26.230
What’s that?!

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.650
It’s time! Begin!

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.060
The Summoning has succeeded.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.890
Huge boa!

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.940
Notify Lord Hokage immediately!

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:20.890
I’m not letting you in the village!

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.190
Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.980
Yes sir!

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.890
Sand Ninja!

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.440
What’s going on?

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.940
Stop that, Gaara!

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.650
I’ll kill him…!

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.520
There’s no meaning in
continuing this fight!

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.190
Don’t forget our mission!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.690
Out of my way…!

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.560
What are you guys doing?!

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.310
The operation is already underway!

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.100
What in the world is going on?

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.890
Gaara!

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.100
What’s the matter?!

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.730
His wound is deeper than
I thought!

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.890
And moreover his Chakra
is pretty drained!

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.190
In that case,
what about using that thing…?

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.150
That’s impossible to do right away!

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.890
Idiot! It’s all because
you didn’t wait for the signal

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.980
and tried to become
the Perfect Possession…

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.890
What should we do?!

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.890
Are you saying we have to do
this without Gaara?

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.400
Isn’t Gaara here yet?!

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.810
Gaara is Sand’s trump card.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.190
We have to get Gaara to do his work,
no matter what!

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.600
You guys leave for the moment and
tend to Gaara’s wounds!

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.400
As soon as Gaara’s Chakra has
been restored…

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.310
the operation will recommence!

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.890
Got it!

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.890
What about you, Sensei?!

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.480
I’m gonna suppress those guys!

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.400
Do you think things will
go according to your plan?

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.020
I’ll make them so…

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.440
Go!

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.310
Okay!

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:23.890
Is Orochimaru the host of this party?

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.600
Dunno… In any case,
let’s heat this thing up.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.520
Sasuke…

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.890
Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.900
You’ve already achieved Chunin level.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.060
If you’re a Leaf Shinobi,
be of service to the Leaf!

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.230
In other words, I’m supposed to
take down that jerk Gaara, right?

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.890
A continuation of earlier on, right?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.560
Don’t pursue too far.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.890
From here on, it’s no longer an exam.
lt’s the real thing!

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.890
What I have to do though…
is the same!

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.890
I won’t let him through!

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.270
Sasuke…!

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.100
Boy oh boy…

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.060
We intended to take Sasuke
while Gaara was causing the trouble.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.900
But not everything goes as planned.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.730
I see… Is that so?

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.890
So Leaf Village and…
Sasuke were the target, huh?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.150
Is the Leaf such a big catch?

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.900
More importantly,
if Gaara wakes up,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.190
I’ll be able to show you something
much more interesting.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.400
Well, anyway…

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.850
Your thick-headedness has caused
the Leaf to be outmaneuvered.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.230
It’s my win.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.940
Nothing is decided
until the very end.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.890
I believe that’s what I taught you…

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.520
Orochimaru.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.890
I thought this day would
eventually arrive.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:37.890
However…

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.770
You won’t get my head that easily!

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.890
I told you, didn’t I?

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.890
It is preferable to decide
the Fifth Hokage quickly…

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.890
Third Hokage…

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.350
because you will…die here.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.890
I wonder how the Chunin Exams
are going?

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.650
I wonder if Naruto’s match is over yet?

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.690
The first match was
with Neji, right?

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.940
I want him to win that
match somehow or other.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:29.850
That’s no good!

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.100
A teacher mustn’t root for
one particular student!

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.100
All the graduating students
are dear to him!

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.980
I must root for all of them equally!

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.890
But I still…want Naruto to win…

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.850
Are you worried about Naruto?

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.400
Well, of course…!

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.810
As I thought…

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.150
Y-You guys…

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.890
I told you to do ten laps around
the school grounds, didn’t I?!

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.400
We finished that long ago.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.100
While you were daydreaming, Sensei.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.890
When our teacher is in that state,
he can’t teach a class!

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.520
So let’s call it quits for today!

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.150
N-No, no!
I’m continuing with class.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.520
I wonder what that smoke is…?

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.520
That’s coming from the direction
of the exam arena…

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.310
Isn’t there some disturbance
to the east?

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.270
I wonder if something happened?

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.890
That Orochimaru…

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.560
What should we do?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.190
Should we send reinforcements?

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.890
No… It’s dangerous to make a move
when we don't really know

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.940
what the situation is.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.890
If the mastermind is Orochimaru…

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.900
even more so.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.440
Is Orochimaru…
that dangerous a guy?

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.350
Originally…he was a student
of the Third Hokage.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.480
So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.520
Long ago, when the Fourth Hokage
was decided…

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.230
Orochimaru apparently asserted that
he was capable of taking on that role.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.810
But his request was denied.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.600
And shortly afterwards,
that guy slipped out of this village.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.850
Orochimaru most likely holds
a grudge against

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.650
the Third Hokage because of that.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.230
Revenge…is it?

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.770
Probably.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.890
Long ago, when I was a kid…

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.810
there’s one thing I remember
thinking when I saw that guy…

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.350
That he didn’t seem human…

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.150
That he seems to be something
that just took on a human form…

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.270
Frightening…

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.890
Simply…frightening.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.600
Reporting!

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.520
A large boa has appeared near
the eastern gate of the Leaf Village!

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.350
And behind it, some one hundred
Sand Ninja are infiltrating the country!

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.890
They are currently engaged in
armed conflict with our Shinobi

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.690
who were patrolling nearby!

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.350
The Sand…?!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.690
Leave Squad One and Two behind
and make for the eastern gate.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.440
Immediately!

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:23.480
– Yes sir! 					– Yes sir!

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.690
We won’t let you past this point!

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.890
There’s quite a large number.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.060
We were careless!

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.600
And even Lord Hokage has been…

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.890
Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.890
Yeah.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:04.480
What…?

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.730
Orochimaru!

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.270
Orochimaru?!

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.150
Why is that guy…?

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.850
Don’t tell me that
they’re after Sasuke again?!

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.350
Sasuke!

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.480
Huh?

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.600
He’s not there…?

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.890
Sakura, stay there for a while.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.890
I’m gonna go reduce
the number of enemies.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.310
Darn! I’m worried about
Lord Hokage, but…

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.060
Leave above to Anbu.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:23.810
Besides…

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.850
Lord Hokage isn’t the kind of guy
who can be taken down that easily.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.890
But…

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:36.060
After all, he is the Hokage of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.600
Are you so happy, you’re crying?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.560
Or…

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:59.400
do you have an iota of sadness
in your heart to kill me, your teacher?

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.980
No…

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.190
Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy…

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.600
but I’m finally awake.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.940
That’s what I thought.

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:36.890
I know you aren’t someone
who would hold a grudge.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.770
You have neither a goal nor motive.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.400
Hmm… I guess…

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.690
I do kind of have a goal.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.940
If I were to explain it…

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.730
It’s interesting to watch things
that move.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.770
I get no pleasure if
something doesn’t move.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.690
Like a windmill that doesn’t turn…

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.060
Well, it may have some kind
of appeal once in a while.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.060
But usually,
it’s not worth looking at it.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.600
Right now…with a wind called
“Destroy the Leaf Village,”

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.100
I want to turn that windmill.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.890
You’re the same as always…

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.150
Sakura!

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.890
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu
survival training

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.350
during the Genin Exam.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.890
You truly have a talent for it.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.890
Huh?

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.900
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.850
Naruto will be delighted.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.100
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.900
What do you mean by a mission?

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.060
Be careful…

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.890
It’s the first A-ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:30.230
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:41.560
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:57.230
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:02.350
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.690
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.890
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:22.980
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:33.890
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:44.440
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.980
Forge on strong
264.01	02:38:02:02	02:38:05:10	Yes! I've been waiting for this!

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.350
Finally, it’s the first A-Ranked mission
in a while!

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.150
Listen, Sakura and Shikamaru!

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.890
As long as I’m with you,
it will be an easy one.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.810
I’m the super hero who
can wake a sleeping lion.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.940
Just keep watching
Mr. Naruto’s stellar performance!

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.900
Next time: “Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!”

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.890
Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!
