WEBVTT

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.690
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.190
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.810
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.400
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.810
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.810
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.480
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.310
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.600
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.270
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.850
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.440
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.890
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.560
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.150
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.440
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.890
Water Style!

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.020
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.890
The same Jutsu as me?!

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.020
Why have you shown up too?

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.350
Well…I asked you to take care
of them earlier.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.560
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.150
What business does
a Rogue Ninja like you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.770
have in this village now?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.150
Kakashi Hatake…

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.890
Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.520
What?! Why?! Why?!

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.940
Why do I have to go on a research trip
with you, Pervy Sage?

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.890
Oh no, this isn’t just any research trip.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.980
There’s a woman whose data
I want to collect.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.650
So we have to look for her first.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.690
I really don’t have time to accompany you
on your perverted research trip!

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.730
Because I have training!

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.600
Hm? Training?

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.770
I will take lessons from Kakashi Sensei
and learn a variety of things, like Chidori!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.440
Kakashi Sensei has been
playing favorites lately!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.480
Well, I think that technique
is impossible for you to learn.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.890
More importantly…
That woman is really beautiful.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.190
You want to meet her, don’t you?!

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.600
Not at all.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.850
I’m not some kid who can
be cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.810
Anyway, no!

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, it can’t be helped…

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.060
Oh, well… I know Jutsu more amazing
than Chidori, but…

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.890
It can’t be helped…
Maybe I’ll take Sasuke?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.100
Of course I’ll go!

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.100
I’ll pack my bags right away.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.440
Pervy Sage, don’t move!

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.150
I’ll be darned… He’s really a cute kid.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.100
Those eyes are exactly the same
as they used to be in the past.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.230
That being said,
he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan…

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.270
I have to assume the worst-case scenario,
just in case.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.150
This is a surprise…
No wonder you copied my Jutsu…

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.310
So there really is a fellow
besides Itachi who has that eye.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.940
Your name is Kakashi,
the Copy Ninja, wasn’t it?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.850
I’m the one who was surprised.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.650
I saw strange men in the tea house
and wondered who they were…

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.890
There they were Itachi Uchiha and…

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.190
the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village,
Kisame Hoshigaki.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.270
Well, well… You know even my name.
lt’s an honor.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.150
I see. You’re one of the
“Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.”

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.350
That huge sword is the “Shark Skin,” right?

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.810
I heard that kid Zabuza
had it out with you?

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.770
Yeah…

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.770
You are someone who’s
well worth lopping off…

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.810
Stop it… Kisame.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.600
If you were to go at it with that man,
it won’t end without cost.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.890
And if you spend too much time,
another Shinobi would come running.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.940
However…

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.890
Don’t lose sight of the goal…
You didn’t come here to get injured!

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.150
Let me hear that “goal” then…?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.350
Just came to find something
we’re looking for.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:10.900
Something you’re looking for?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.100
The thing you’re looking for…
What is it?

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.020
I’m different from Kisame,
I won’t take time.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.730
Ninja Art: Water Style.
Water wall!

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.060
That’s some Jutsu speed.
My eyes couldn’t follow the Sign.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.020
That Shuriken in the right hand
was a decoy…

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.900
to use a Water Style Jutsu to launch
an attack below my foot …

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.690
That’s what to expect from you, Kakashi.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.940
Your power of analytical eye…is great.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.650
A Shadow Clone?!
His Jutsu speed is too fast!

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.940
A water clone?!

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.060
The Copy Ninja has done well this far
with Jutsu of my village.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.940
Nice! Kakashi!

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.600
Get down, Kurenai!

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.560
This one is the Shadow Clone…

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.060
Huh?

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.020
Kakashi! Kurenai!

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.020
He made the Shadow Clone
body explode?!

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.980
A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.940
Sakura’s going to start to like me…

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.890
Maybe!

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.890
Kakashi Sensei and Sasuke
will be surprised!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.890
Kakashi…!

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:18.980
Don’t lower your guard…

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.690
He’s the guy who became a division chief
of Anbu Black Ops at 13 years old…

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.980
To think he’s this powerful…

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.230
No, you haven’t seen
this guy’s strength yet.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.650
I didn’t expect that you who are not
a member of the Uchiha clan

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.270
would have mastered
the Sharingan to that extent…

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:43.310
But your body isn’t the “Uchiha clan” body
that goes with the eye.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.400
That’s right. As a result,
my stamina doesn't last…

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.520
There’s a reason why the Uchiha Clan
was deemed the strongest and feared…

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.980
I’ll demonstrate the true strength
of Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.270
I-It can’t be!

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.890
This is bad!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.350
Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.890
Both of you! Don’t look at his eyes!

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.900
Both of you,
absolutely do not open your eyes…

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.310
It’s all over now if your eyes meet.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.190
Only people with Sharingan
can have a go with that technique.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.890
Indeed with Sharingan,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.400
you can resist this Mangekyo Sharingan
to a certain extent.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.480
However…

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.890
this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.890
Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm,
is unbreakable.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.060
The only person who can bring me down
is someone

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.890
using the same Kekkei Genkai,
a Sharingan user…

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.890
Sasuke…

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.730
I wonder how much you can take
without the Kekkei Genkai?

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.770
The one just now was…Genjutsu?

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.890
In the world of Tsukuyomi…

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.890
Both space and time…

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.560
and mass…
I control them all.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.100
For the next 72 hours…

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.890
I’ll stab you continually with swords.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.150
That’s…

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.890
In the world of Tsukuyomi…

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.310
Both space and time…

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.020
and mass…
I control them all.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.150
Calm down… This is Genjutsu.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.900
It’s best not to be optimistic
and think it’s an illusion.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.100
This pain is not an illusion.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.890
This pain is absolutely
no different from reality.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.940
How long will your spirit sustain?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.770
There’s…
71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:49.940
Wha…?!

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.730
S-Since then…?!

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.350
That’s all the time that has passed?!

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.270
What happened, Kakashi?!

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.020
Are you saying we should keep
our eyes closed still?!

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.690
N-Not…yet…

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.770
What happened?!

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.310
Just as that guy finished speaking,
you suddenly fell over!

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.440
Three days in that world is less than
a moment in the actual world, huh…

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.440
But…why doesn’t he kill me?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.650
He could easily do so, if he wants to…

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.980
Whoa…To take that Jutsu without causing
his spirit to collapse.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.900
But Itachi…

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.940
it’s also dangerous for you
to overuse those eyes.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.940
The thing you’re looking for…

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.060
is it Sasuke?

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.980
No…the legacy of the Fourth Hokage…

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.020
These guys.
What the heck are they planning…?

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.440
So, Naruto, is it…?

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.600
It’s been a long time…

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.940
How many years has it been
since you returned to the village?

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.980
Kakashi…

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.850
I will keep Naruto under my care.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.770
It was an understandable decision
of the Third Hokage

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.310
who appointed you to
the role of watching over Naruto…

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:36.310
But even at your level,
you may not be able to handle it properly.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:38.850
What in the world are you saying?

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.690
I’ve been observing Orochimaru
ever since he left the village…

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:52.350
It was obvious that he would return
to this village sooner or later.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:57.400
All told, at first I was concerned
only about him, but…

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.310
What is it?

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.890
The guy joined an organization.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.100
An organization?

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.890
What are the details of the organization?

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.890
I don’t know much of the details,

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.230
but it’s a small organization known
as Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.600
Until recently, they weren’t making
any dramatic moves

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.850
except some cloak-and-dagger activities.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.890
The biggest concern is
the members of that organization.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.190
Almost all of them are listed
on the Bingo Book,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.190
all S-rank deviant criminals.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.060
That Itachi is among them.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.520
If the nine of them get together,
their intent will not be volunteer activities.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.900
Since you’ve been told this much,
you already know what it means.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.520
But recently, Orochimaru pulled out
of the organization.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.770
And at that time,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.890
other members of the organization
went in to action in different areas,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.150
in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.650
Is there proof that one of those
things is the Nine-Tailed Fox?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.900
It’s possible.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.890
Because it’s one of the spirits
who possess the strongest Chakra…

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440
Kakashi…

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:28.900
Sooner or later, that Naruto will have
to live watching his back…

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.890
That’s his destiny.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.350
For now, you should keep
your eyes on Sasuke.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.270
It’s necessary for you to teach him
how to use his Sharingan.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.020
I’ll take care of Naruto for a while.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:59.400
The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Naruto
is your target?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.850
I know that you two aren’t
the only ones on the move…

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.440
The name of your organization is
Akatsuki, right?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.520
Akatsuki?

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:22.020
Kisame! We’ll take Kakashi.
Erase the other two.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.560
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.230
Who are you?

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.890
The Leaf’s noble, blue fierce animal…

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.980
Mighty Guy!

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.770
What a sight…
Shouldn’t you be called a strange beast?

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.900
Don’t underestimate that man…

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.940
That man is Itachi!

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.900
You did this to Kakashi…?

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.560
Don’t look at Itachi’s eyes, Guy!
You’ll be caught up in his Jutsu!

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.890
I know that already!

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:20.350
In order to fight Kakashi,
I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.890
Open your eyes, both of you!

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.560
B-But…

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.230
When you battle with the Sharingan,

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.440
it’s not a problem if
you don’t look at those eyes!

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.400
You work around it by
gaining insight into his movements

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.440
by looking constantly at his feet.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.890
Now that you mention it,
you’re probably right, but…

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:44.730
You’re the only one who can do that.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.890
That’s true…

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.100
There’s a knack to reading

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.400
all of your opponents’ movements
only by his feet.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.150
But I can’t teach it to you
in this emergency.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.480
Just get used it right now!

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.890
What should we do?

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.520
Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:03.690
Asuma, you are my back-up!

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:04.520
Okay!

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.310
And until the reinforcements of
Anbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.770
I will hang out with you guys.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.890
Interesting…
That’s some nerve…

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.190
Kisame… Pull the plug.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.600
We didn’t come to have a war.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.730
It’s too bad,
but no more of this nonsense.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.190
We’re leaving.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.730
Too bad… I was finally feeling motivated.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.270
It can’t be helped.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.230
All right!

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.890
Here I go!

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.890
Y-You’re putting too much spirit into it.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:10.020
You’re not training on a mountain retreat,
you know that, right?

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.890
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.850
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:40.940
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.020
It's a secondary role,

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.890
a role in the shadows

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:55.230
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:00.890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:06.020
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.980
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:20.270
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:25.690
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.890
There's a super beautiful
young lady over there!

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.020
She just winked at us!

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.270
Look, Naruto!
She must be interested in us!

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.890
She may be cuter than Sakura!

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.890
– All right, Naruto!
– Yeah!

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.440
Go back, train,
then go to bed.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.810
You always do that to me!

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.900
Next time: "Jiraiya:
Naruto's Potential Disaster!"

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.890
What are we gonna do
about my training?!
