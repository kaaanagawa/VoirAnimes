WEBVTT

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.110
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:29.940
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.320
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.490
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.650
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.200
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.070
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.200
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.360
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.030
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:28.990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.940
Don’t forget your objective…

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.950
Don’t go!

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.070
Thank you…

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.360
Sasuke…

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.610
Formation!
               The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.570
It’s already four o’clock
in the morning…

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360
That Fifth Hokage is
a real slave driver.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.110
She ought to retrieve
the documents she forgot herself…

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.740
Huh… What’s the matter?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.940
Hey! Wake up!

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.240
You’ll catch cold if you sleep
in a place like this.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
Thank you…

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.990
Huh!

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.200
Sasuke!

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.940
Good work…

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.860
Fifth Hokage! You were asleep
just now, weren’t you?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.070
When you made us
go to fetch the documents!

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.990
And only you got to sleep!

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940
More importantly, Lady Hokage,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.740
there’s something
I want to report to you.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.400
What is it?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.360
What did you just say?!

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.280
Is that true?!

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.650
Yes…

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.940
According to Sakura Haruno,
it appears that there’s no mistake…

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.610
Unbelievable…
That they should already be on the move…

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.940
In addition to getting what I want…

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.650
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.150
So what that pervert wants...

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.940
is the Uchiha’s powers, huh…

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.940
Izumo! Kotetsu!

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.450
There’s somebody
I want you to bring here!

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.030
Hurry up and eat, Shikamaru!
Your Dad’s mission starts today, too!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.700
There’s not that much time
for morning training!

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.400
OK, OK.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.110
One OK is enough!

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.400
Nag, nag, nag from early
in the morning…

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.860
I wonder who it could be
so early in the morning?

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.950
Hey…Dad…

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.260
What is it?

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.610
Why did you marry
a hard-edged woman like Mom?

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.940
Let’s see now…

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.900
Even though Mom's like that,
she smiles gently sometimes…

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.780
Maybe that’s why…

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.820
Is that the only reason?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.700
Shikamaru!

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.280
A messenger of the Fifth Hokage
is here.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.900
Sasuke Uchiha apparently slipped out
of the village late last night.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.780
And…there is almost no mistake

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.450
that he is headed for
the Village Hidden in the Sound!

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.940
Slipped out?! Why…

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.110
Because he was enticed by
that Orochimaru!

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.360
W-W-Wait a minute!

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.940
Why does Sasuke have to be enticed
by a risky guy like that?!

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.900
The reason doesn’t matter.
ln any case, there’s no time.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.400
You will perform your first mission
as a Chunin…

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.990
So all I have to do
is bring Sasuke back?

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.490
As long as there aren’t
any enemies around,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.780
that shouldn’t be
too much of a hassle…

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.780
Yes… However, not only is time
of the essence on this mission,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.240
but it may turn into something
quite difficult.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.110
Huh?!

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.070
There is a strong possibility that

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.940
those under the control of Orochimaru
are guiding Sasuke.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.940
This is turning into a real pain
in the neck.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.940
That guy… I held him in high respect
in so many different ways…

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.490
In that case, please give me
a four-man team

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.940
composed only of Jonin and Chunin.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.990
I’m afraid I can’t do that…

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.900
Huh! Why?!

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.940
You already know
the answer to that…

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.570
Right now, only the barest minimum
number of Jonin have been left behind

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.110
and the others have all
left the village on missions.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.240
Within the next 30 minutes,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.860
I want you to gather all the Genin you
consider the best, and leave this village!

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.780
It’s a drag but…

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.030
I know the guy,
so I just can’t just let the matter go.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.530
What shall be, shall be…

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.940
There’s one guy
I want to recommend.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.900
What! You’ve gotta be kidding!

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.950
You are such a drag starting
so early in the morning…

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.320
But why this guy?

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.650
That jerk!

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.610
Hey, just wait here!

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.990
I’ll change my clothes immediately!

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.940
So, do you have your eye…

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.610
on any other guys besides me
who are excellent?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.200
Yeah…

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.570
Wake up! Hey!

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.940
You said excellent guys, right…

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.650
Can’t be helped…

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.940
Potato chips?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.150
They’re barbecued meat flavor…
you help out too!

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.940
Huh?!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.450
Here he comes!

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.070
Even if it is just potato chips,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.110
I won’t let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.700
Choji and I have worked as
a team for many years,

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.280
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.900
I understand that,

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.360
but in this kind of situation,
one would normally solicit Shino first!

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.780
Oh, shut up.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.940
Fat chance...!

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.570
Shino is on a special mission
with his father.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.530
Hey…don’t tell me…

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.940
Right. He's in.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.150
No way...!

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.940
I see… Sounds interesting…

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.860
It looks like it was worth getting up early
and going for a walk, doesn’t it?

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.070
Shikamaru, what about the other guys?

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.940
I’d like to take my time to look for some,
but we’re pressed for time.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.240
If we don’t find anybody else
by the time we leave the village,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.610
it will be just us!

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.240
It appears that your operation
was a success.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.360
Yeah…

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.110
Is it okay for you
to be released already?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.940
I was told that I would be able
to undertake light training soon.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.940
I see…

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.280
I see…

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.900
It’s a hassle,
but the more people the better…

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.940
Damn… At a time like this, I…

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.780
Lee! Do what you need to do.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.200
I’ll climb these steps alone
starting tomorrow!

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.150
Lee…

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.150
I’ll be fine! You go!

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.650
We’re at our time limit!

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.400
Well, I’ve assembled five people…

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.780
All right! Everybody, follow me!

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.740
Hey…

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.610
Hey, Naruto…

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.030
I’m supposed to be the squad leader.
Though it sure is a drag…

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.700
You really think everything will be okay
if things are left in your hands?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.700
You don’t seem very reliable…

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.030
What’s up with you acting
like the boss, Naruto?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.950
Although being ordered about by
some unmotivated guy like Shikamaru

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.280
doesn’t sit right with me either…

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.360
But Shikamaru is already a Chunin!

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.940
We have to follow his orders.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.740
What that means is that
the elders of the village recognized him

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:09.320
as capable of being a leader.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:15.110
Since that’s the case,
come up with some strategy and plan.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.240
From what I heard,
there are enemies

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.570
and there’s a strong possibility
that they’re gonna ambush us.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.240
For a start,
as this is a rescue operation,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.940
we will be in the position
of pursuit.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.950
In other words,
the enemy can easily gain the initiative.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.570
Therefore, I will decide
on a deployment formation

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.940
that will respond quickly
to any assault by the enemy.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.610
If you ignore me and
move of your own accord,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.950
we will all die.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.940
We will go in a single file formation.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.940
First of all,
the all-important spearhead will be…

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.110
Kiba, that’s you!

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.030
You and Akamaru go on
walks year round

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:01.110
and are therefore well-versed in the terrain
and geography of the Land of Fire.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.940
And since your nose is
very sensitive,

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.990
you can track Sasuke
with your sense of smell and,

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.820
you can distinguish booby traps
that carry the enemy’s scent

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.950
which makes them
easy to find…

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.700
And moreover, you and Akamaru as
a pair will be extremely efficient

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.990
in compensating for the weakness
of a single file formation to assault.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.700
And…second in line will be me,
the squad leader.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.950
I can give orders
as required in any situation

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.110
from my position
directly behind Kiba

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.950
and can give orders to those behind me
using only hand signals.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.950
And in the middle...
in the number three position is Naruto.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.700
The middle position is
the best for you,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.860
since you're capable
of executing quick moves

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.940
and are able to respond immediately
to anything in front or behind.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.070
You're the cornerstone...
And you have Shadow Clone, too.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.030
And fourth in line is Choji.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.610
You. You don't have speed,

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.030
but your ability to strike is the best
among the squad members.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.940
Line leader Kiba, I, and Naruto
will launch a surprise attack

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.700
and I’ll use you to launch
the deciding blow.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.820
In other words, your role is
to attack the routed enemy.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.940
And then, on the tail end
will be you, Neji…

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.530
You are assigned to
the most difficult position of rear lookout.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.950
You will use your Byakugan
to constantly check

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.740
that there are no loopholes
in the ranks.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.030
Got it? Take a careful look at this.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.950
Use this diagram to verify
the radius of your assigned watch.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.780
Kiba watches the front,

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.110
I’m responsible for
a wide forward view,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:46.570
Naruto watches left, Choji right,
and Neji…

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.320
Using your Byakugan,
you cover the entire area to the rear.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.150
I want to familiarize myself
with our current military potential.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.450
Let me check all the Ninja equipment
each of you currently has…

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.700
I will commit that
to memory straight away.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.780
Any questions?

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.110
Even though he just assembled
his men a short while ago,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.940
he’s already created
the best possible formation…

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.940
If not, I want to tell you
the most important thing last.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.940
Sasuke and I aren’t close friends.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.200
In fact, I don’t particularly like him.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.070
However, he is also a Shinobi belonging
to the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.570
He is a comrade!

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.940
Therefore, I will put my life
on the line to help him!

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.320
That’s the way
of the Leaf Village.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.740
In this case, even I can’t just sit back
and be a sluggard.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.400
Because I am responsible
for your lives.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:01.650
Wow… You’re acting kind of
like a Chunin, aren’t you?!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.530
Okay then, as soon as he's checked
our Ninja tools, we’ll depart.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.860
Everybody, take out your Ninja tools.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.940
Sasuke wouldn’t fall victim
to that kind of guy’s enticement…

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.110
He’s already
a really powerful guy,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.360
so he wouldn’t need to do
that kind of thing! I guarantee it!

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.650
Damn… Why, Sasuke…?!

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.400
All right! Let’s go!

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.110
Wait!

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.950
Sakura!

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.030
I heard the whole story
from Lady Hokage.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.530
I’m sorry, but I can’t take you along
on this mission.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.900
Even you weren’t able
to convince Sasuke, right?

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.940
All that can be done now is for us
to use force to convince him…

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.940
Sakura, your role in this has ended.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.940
Which means, Sakura,
that you and Sasuke…?!

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.860
Sakura…

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.030
Naruto… This is a…
once in a lifetime request...

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.940
Please bring…
please bring Sasuke back.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:48.820
I couldn’t do it!
I wasn’t able to stop Sasuke!

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.280
At this point, the only person
who would be able to stop Sasuke…

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.700
who would be able to save him…

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.740
is you…Naruto…

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.940
You like Sasuke so much,
don’t you, Sakura?

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.280
I understand to my very core

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.200
how painful it must be
for you right now, Sakura.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.860
Sakura, there’s one thing
I want to ask you.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.860
Huh?

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.940
How do you feel about…Naruto?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.450
Thwarting someone’s love seems
to have become natural to him.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.610
He actually seems to be enjoying
my suffering.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:47.240
Naruto doesn’t understand
the least thing about me.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.940
He’s just annoying.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.070
Naruto…thank you…

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.150
I’ll bring Sasuke back without fail!
I promise that on my life!

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.320
You always understood me…

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.240
You always helped me…

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.940
Naruto…

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.150
Hey, hey, Naruto!

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.740
You really think you’re gonna be okay
saying that kind of thing?!

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.860
Sure! I will not go back on my word.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.940
That’s my Way of the Ninja!

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.450
All right! Let’s hurry up and go!

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.860
We’ve lost a little time…
Let’s hurry!

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.940
OK!

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.070
Naruto struck the pose of
a nice guy as he said that…

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.110
It’ll all be all right now.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.940
I’m positive…
I’m positive that it will all go well!

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.110
Master Sasuke… Around here will do,
don’t you think?

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.820
We’ve already exited
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.030
What is that?

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.360
To tell you the truth,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.940
Orochimaru has given us
one important task…

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.240
So…what is it?

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.490
It will be necessary for you
to die once…

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:32.280
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.940
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:43.150
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:53.530
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:59.030
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.070
Look like a mountain

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.940
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.820
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.940
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.150
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.490
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.740
Look like a mountain

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.240
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:46.570
Look like a mountain

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.940
From here on up, there's more danger
of traps and ambushes.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.940
– Stay alert and use all your senses.
– Roger that!

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.240
– Find the enemy before he gets you.
– You can count on me!

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.240
– And any signs of the enemy--
– Right!

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.150
Say, are you listening?!

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.780
Not to worry.
No matter who the enemy may be,

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.400
I'll thrash him with
my new technique!

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.900
I'm a fool to
even attempt to explain.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.570
Next time:
 "Sound vs. Leaf"
