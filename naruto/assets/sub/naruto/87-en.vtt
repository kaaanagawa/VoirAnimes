00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.730
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
I’ve done it!
The water is turning!

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.600
It seems it’s going to be easier
than I thought to break it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.150
Then I’ll go take a little rest
until it’s done…with this.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.650
Hey! What is that?!

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.850
I need it to kill the time.
And also to get some sleep.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.400
Huh! The way it’s going,
it won’t even be an afternoon nap!

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.190
Is that so…?
Call me when it is broken.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.770
Just wait!

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.650
If it keeps up like this,
I’ll learn it within today!

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.190
Keep on Training!
Pop Goes the Water Balloon

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.560
Oh man! Why doesn’t it break!

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.890
Huh? Are you done with it?

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.350
Ah…well, it’s almost done
or how should I call it.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.060
Oh boy…

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.650
It seems like I went beyond
an afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.900
Hey, hey…how do I break it?

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.480
Didn’t I tell you I can’t give
a detailed explanation until it’s broken?

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.890
All right, I understand…

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.890
Naturally, you’re supposed to realize it
through trial and error

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.770
when mastering a Jutsu, but…

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.020
Yeah, yeah.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.230
I guess I’ll teach you just
a tiny bit on the Jutsu…

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.690
You, try rotating the water!

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.350
Oh, okay.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.520
Right or left…which direction did you
imagine when you rotate it?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.980
Hmm…well, to the left…

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.270
Hey, come over here.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.400
Okay…

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.100
Huh, I thought so…

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.400
W-What?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.690
You are in fact a right-rotation type.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.150
Right?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.020
In order to build up Chakra,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.940
it is necessary to blend the energy…

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.480
Chakra
							Spiritual energy       Physical energy
		So everybody unconsciously builds up
		Chakra inside the body by rotating it.
55	01:54:25:29	01:54:29:20
              Right                             Left
		Whether the rotation at that point
		is to the right or to the left

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.270
differs in the individual.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.890
Therefore, if you imagine
the rotation of the water balloon

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.150
opposite to that of your rotation-type
in this training,

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.560
your Chakra flow divides and resists

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.900
and the momentum of
the rotation does not get on track.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.400
You should be able to figure
that kind of stuff on your own.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.230
But how did you figure out that
I’m a right-type so fast?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.890
The cowlick on your head!

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.890
It's pretty much determined that you’re
a right type if a whorl rolls to the right

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.690
and you’re a left-type
if it rolls to the left.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.310
It’s simple.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.890
Huh, so I have a right roll!

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.810
Yes, so if you want to rotate it,
you have to imagine a right rotation.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.890
I never really paid attention
that until now…

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.230
But this Jutsu is just the one for you.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.440
Hand sign is completely unnecessary.
All you need is Chakra.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.730
There is no need to learn
a finicky hand sign!

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.770
It’s okay to be stupid!

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.890
I’m not stupid!

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.770
I’m the man who’s eventually going
to become a Hokage!

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.100
It’s easy once you understand!

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.890
This Jutsu, I’ll completely master it
if I got three days!

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.100
Three days, huh?

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.980
This Jutsu is a Ninjutsu
that the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.270
Huh…?

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.770
It took him three whole years
to perfect this Jutsu…

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.650
This Jutsu is second from the top

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.980
on the six degrees of
difficulty in mastering…

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.310
It’s an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.060
In order to learn this move,
there are three steps in the training.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.810
This “Water Balloon Breaking”
is the first step.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.150
It took the genius Ninja,
the Fourth Hokage…

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.690
Three years…

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.560
There’s no point in explaining
anymore to someone

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.350
who can’t even clear the first step.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.810
Do the rest by yourself!

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.100
Take care!
I’m going to return to the town.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.600
I have to gather some information…

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.940
What will you do?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.850
A-rank in degree of difficulty
in mastering…

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.810
The Ninjutsu left behind
by the Fourth Hokage…

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.440
I’m not gonna go back yet!

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.890
Huh…

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.890
So long… Don’t go overboard with it.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.940
Now, what will happen?

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.520
It’s something to be concerned about…

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.890
Mister!

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.150
Why don’t you stop by?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.600
This month is our special service month.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.560
Whoa! It’s a special service month?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.400
The more you visit,
the more you benefit.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.690
Here you go, a stamp card!

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.770
I’ll give you lots and lots of service!

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.400
I’ll come, I’ll come!

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.890
Hey! Come on down, Shu!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.890
Hey, hey, where is the toilet?

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.730
I don’t have time to spend three years.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.890
All right now!

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.270
Training, once again today!
I’m gonna work hard like a blaze!

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.400
Break! Break! Break!

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.890
Why won’t it break?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.890
Little Jiraiya, you’re so naughty!

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.270
Men are all naughty!

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.810
Dang it!

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.980
Three days have passed since
I got the tip from that Pervy Sage…

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.100
The rubber is stretched this much,
but why won’t it break?

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:04.810
What am I doing different from
that Pervy Sage?

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.890
This is great! This is so great!

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.980
What the--?

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.060
Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.350
I’m gonna eat now!

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.690
Huh?

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.890
What's the matter?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.890
Oh dang it!

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.890
Darn it! Why is it like this?!

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:12.060
No need to learn a finicky hand sign!
lt’s okay to be stupid!

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.400
He said that there’s no need to form
a hand signal, but…

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.890
Hey! That’s not your toy…

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.440
This is it!

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:56.310
Hurry up and wake up!
Hey, you Pervy Sage!

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.890
Uh… G-Good timing.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.310
Why don’t you bring me some water…

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.560
Water?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.230
The first step is cleared!

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.100
Cleared…?

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.150
Well, let’s have you show it to me.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.900
All right! Watch it carefully!

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.020
Left hand?

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.980
Go!

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:52.520
All right! See that?! See that?!

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.440
You’re sleeping!

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.270
Sorry, sorry.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.890
I’m tired from the days and nights
of gathering information.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.810
But that seems suspicious to begin with!

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.440
You still stink of alcohol too!

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.310
Nevertheless…

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.890
You rotate the water inside the water balloon
that you hold in your left hand

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.310
by repeatedly applying it
with your right hand…

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.900
It seems little strange of an idea, but…

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.890
You’re an interesting kid.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.900
You understood the trick pretty well.
lt’s all thanks to me, though.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.440
It’s thanks to this guy!

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.730
Huh?

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.440
I realized after I saw this cat playing
with the water balloon.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.600
He kept on flicking it with
his paw many times

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.230
and the water inside shocked
in all different kinds of direction…

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.480
Then it came to me like “bingo!”

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.600
How did it come like “bingo”?

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.020
The time when the Pervy Sage
first showed me breaking it…

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.310
I remembered how the water balloon
surface was not smooth.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.890
Until then,
I was always only rotating the water

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.890
in the one same direction…

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.520
I realized that the Pervy Sage’s
water balloon was not smooth

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.890
because the water inside was rotating
in different directions.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.730
And after doing it in my own way,
it broke!

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.890
It seems it’s still not possible for you

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.560
to rotate it violently with one hand, but…

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.890
I suppose you thought it out
in your own way.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.890
That’s just what he expected of me!

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.190
Anyhow…
The first step is complete for now.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.890
All right!

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.890
Do you want to see it one more time?
One more time!

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.890
Oww!

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.890
You used too much Chakra and
it gradually reached the point

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.890
where there’s burden
on the Chakra Network…

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.900
But the next one won’t be like this!

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:01.310
Okay. Now, we will proceed
to the second step.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.520
Yeah!

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.890
It seems like we can finally go
into some serious training!

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.150
– Here you go! 					– Huh?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.020
Rubber ball?
Something like this again?!

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.600
Now, you’ll break this one!

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.350
It’s one hundred times harder
than the water balloon!

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.060
It’s hard…

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.980
The first step is rotation,
the second step is force.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.310
Since there is no water inside,

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.980
it’s more difficult to imagine
the rotation of Chakra,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.270
so it becomes more difficult
to rotate the Chakra as well.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.060
That’s true…

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.600
I’ll leave that to your own judgment.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.690
I need to learn a trick again
to do this, don’t I?

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.890
Well then,
I’ll go gather some information.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.810
Hey! Wait, wait!

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.230
Let’s train together for
the first time in a while!

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.020
I don’t mind if you take a nap.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.560
Don’t depend on me!

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.480
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.150
I did say that I’ll teach you the Jutsu,

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.650
but I don’t have the obligation
to teach you every step of the way.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.900
If you can’t do it by yourself,
then that’s it.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.440
Don’t be childish forever…
Become more respectable like a Shinobi!

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:27.810
Well, well then.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:32.270
If you can at least teach me…
the trick again…

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:34.690
Money!

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.770
Money…money…money…

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.440
W-What do you mean
“be respectable like a Shinobi”?!

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.100
Even though you say that,
you’re an dirty and greedy adult!

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.770
You’re not a respectable Shinobi at all!

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.890
It’s way more difficult than
the time with the water balloon…

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.890
A-And…

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.770
my hands and arms hurt.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.270
Dang it! How many days am I
going to be doing the same thing!

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.100
Second from the top in
 the difficulty of mastering…

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.150
Don’t depend on me!

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.890
You must have some kind
of misunderstanding!

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.520
Dang it!

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.560
Hey, Naruto.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.890
What did you come here for?

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.480
Go buy some food from the town below.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.890
What?! Why me?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.980
Hey you…

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.270
Even if for a while, you’re still
learning the Jutsu from me.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.890
Here you go, thanks for waiting.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.400
Thank you.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.400
How dare he put on a master’s face
only at a time like this

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.890
when he doesn’t teach me anything…

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:39.690
Dad, buy me some ice cream.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.810
I want this one that cracks.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.980
Here.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.690
Why? I can eat all of it by myself.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.890
Nope, when you get home,
your mother will have supper ready.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.890
Okay!

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.480
Hey…you know…

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.400
Huh?

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.310
Can you be around my training
for just a while…today?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.770
I don’t have time for that.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.770
I have to immediately go to town.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.600
Unless you think for yourself and
get a grip of the trick for yourself,

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.350
it’ll never work.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.940
I thought I told you three weeks ago!

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.890
Don’t be spoiled like a kid.
You are a Ninja.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.270
I know that without
your telling me!

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.100
Just thought I'd ask.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.980
Hurry up and go,
you Pervy Sage!

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.350
Oh no, little Jiraiya,
you tell so many lies!

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.850
What do you mean?!
Everything is true!

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.890
Dang it! It doesn’t break
no matter how much I try…

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.560
I’m just dripping away
my Chakra this way.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.770
Also…

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.440
The more I increase the amount of flow,
the worse the pain gets.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.890
But… How do I say it?

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.520
If I don’t go all out as if
to explode the Chakra,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.100
it’s not going to break!

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.020
That’s it!

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.650
If I understand the amount of Chakra
that flows from the pain I feel…

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.890
Then I can bear the pain to the limit
and all at once…

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.770
No, not yet…

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.060
Not yet!

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.100
Not yet…store it!

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.890
Now!

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.480
Oww!

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.560
Hmm… There seems to have been
a little progress.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.350
Humph!

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.310
I’ve still only opened a hole
and it hasn’t popped with a bang!

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.890
Hey, don’t pretend to be so tough. Here!

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.890
You’ve done well,
all on your own power.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.520
It’s so good!

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.100
Yes…

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.690
Oh yeah. Maybe we’ll test a bit.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:04.890
What, what?

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.850
Give me your right hand.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.980
What’s this?

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.060
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:32.020
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:41.350
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.440
It's a secondary role,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.190
a role in the shadows

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:55.650
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:01.230
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:06.310
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:11.270
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:20.560
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.890
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.650
He tells me
 "focus, focus, focus!"

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.690
But I've never been good at it, ever.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.230
Speaking of concentration,

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.310
Iruka Sensei used to scold me often
at the Ninja Academy

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.940
for my lack of concentration.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.940
Oh…I would've listened to him better
if I knew this would happen.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:16.230
Next time: "Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf"
