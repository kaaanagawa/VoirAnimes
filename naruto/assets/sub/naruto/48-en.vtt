WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.190
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.090
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.960
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.450
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.020
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.410
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.720
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.550
Hey you, failure.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.020
I have two pieces
of advice for you.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.820
First, if you intend to call
yourself a Shinobi,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.260
stop that revolting cheering of yours.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.060
And second...

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.660
a failure will
always be a failure.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.630
There's no changing that!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.670
Do you want to see about that?

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.810
You!

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.020
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.250
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.060
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.800
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.270
I promise you.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.110
I will win no matter what!

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.560
Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.430
Hey, Choji!

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.960
You're in trouble.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.570
Only the strong ones are left.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.400
Probably the strongest of Hidden Sound
must be that bloke.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.380
And Lee is apparently strong
enough to take on Sasuke!

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.180
And particularly that Sand guy!

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.550
He's probably
the most dangerous one!

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.820
I-I don't care!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.560
I plan to forfeit right away
if that happens…

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:35.860
So that means…

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.490
Huh?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.360
...you plan to forego
all-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.570
What? Come on!

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.270
Don’t worry.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.600
If things start getting ugly,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.540
I'll step in and stop the fight,
like I did for Hinata. Okay?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.610
Prime beef tongue, short ribs...

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.150
– You can eat what you want.
– Don't dangle food in front of him!

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.250
– Besides he didn't step in...
– You can eat whatever you want...

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.020
– and stop the fight for Hinata.
– and all you want.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.560
B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!
All you can eat!

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.560
He doesn't look good.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.300
Watching the previous fight…

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.540
Did it get stirred up?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.340
His inner demon!

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.480
I’m curious about that guy, Neji, too…

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.550
Here's a plan.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.480
Kankuro?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.190
Just a little
information-gathering mission.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.560
Hey!

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.220
Huh?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.630
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.460
Shouldn't you be with your friends?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.000
I-It's none of your business, is it?!

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.970
Hmmm. Well, well…

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.440
That guy... Neji Hyuga, right?

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.710
Well, it seems to me that

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.540
he didn't reveal the true extent
of his power in that last match.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.680
What's he about?

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.750
I'm going to crush him!

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.550
Err, that's not what
I was asking.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.560
Besides, this guy’s way out of his league...

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.230
You seem like a fun guy.
I quite like you.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.570
You're dull.
And I don't like you at all!

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.540
I'm going to waste this guy!

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.840
We will now resume the battle.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.550
Okay!

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.750
You'll be up this time for sure.
Go for it, Lee!

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.550
No!

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.420
– Huh? 					– What?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.690
Seeing as I've come this far,
I rather be the last!

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.070
Is Lee sulking?

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.030
Hurry up and get down here…

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.800
Safe!

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.100
– Hey!
– Don't do anything misleading, idiot!

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.470
Gaara vs. Rock Lee

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.270
Oh! Lee!

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.610
It worked!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.550
If you say you want to go last,
then you won't be last.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.320
It's an application of the same law

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.890
that says a stone thrown to hit
a telephone pole will miss,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.860
and a stone thrown to miss
will be a direct hit!

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.130
Right! That's my student!

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.630
I absolutely did not
want to go last!

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.560
I threw them a beauty of a curve!

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.070
Threw whom a curve?

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.900
Okay, so let me give you
a little piece of “nice” advice.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.140
Right!

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.540
Probably no one has noticed yet, but…

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.950
That gourd is suspicious!

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.550
I see!

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.220
Quit with the notes!

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.550
You're not going to have time to
read them during the match! Fool!

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.550
I see!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.960
He didn't realize that?

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.260
Wow, is Lee going to be all right?

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.670
All right! 					Go! Lee!

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.730
Yeah!

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.710
I am very happy to be squaring
off with you so early in the match.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.560
I don't know what kind of moves
that bowl-cut guy has,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.560
but he will never take Gaara.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.560
Never!

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.730
He's fast, to be sure,
but his kick is not all that great.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.500
No…

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.610
He's... strong!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.220
Please don't be in such a hurry.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.460
Lee…

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.400
Be careful, Lee.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.210
Now then… The 9th match...

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:53.840
Begin!

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.920
Leaf Hurricane!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.570
Is that…?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.540
Sand?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.540
What an unusual Jutsu…

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.110
There's sand in his gourd!

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:26.710
That's…

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.550
That's it?

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.690
Desert Coffin!

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.260
Desert Burial!

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.170
Not another horror story like that…

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.440
A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.140
Sounds like trouble.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.180
But let's give it a go!

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.540
Even that Lee’s fast strikes…

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.140
have no effect at all!

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.550
What's the deal?!

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.620
No physical strike is going to
have any effect on him.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:40.480
What?

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.650
The Sand shields and protects Gaara

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.920
on its own accord, independently
of any intent on Gaara's part.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.860
That's why... no one has been able
to do it so far....

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.630
Injure Gaara, that is.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.010
Curses! He's not moving
a muscle and still...!

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.340
Is that it?

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.110
Entertain me a bit more…

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.480
There's not enough yet!

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.220
Blood!

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.340
Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.810
He'll never be able to get close
enough for that!

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.640
Why doesn't he step back a bit and
use Ninjutsu or something?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.510
It’s not that he doesn't use it.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.420
He can’t use it.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.480
Huh?

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.020
Lee has almost no Ninjutsu
or Genjutsu skills.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.760
N-No way!

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.000
When I first met Lee,
he was completely inept.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.960
He had no talent whatsoever.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.400
What? I can't believe that!

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.400
Hey hey!

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.070
Certainly…

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.550
A ninja who can’t do Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu is a rarity.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:57.550
That’s why, the only path open to Lee
as a Ninja was Taijutsu.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.560
But! That's precisely what
makes him a winner!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.460
Huh?

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.460
Lee, take them off!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.660
B-But Guy Sensei...!

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.500
You told me only to do that

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.170
to protect a large group
of very important people!

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.770
That’s quite all right!

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.470
I give you permission!

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.050
Are those…?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.550
Weights?

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.190
That's some cliché training…

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.560
I see!

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.560
Ridiculous!

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.430
All right, now I can
move easily!

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.570
Humph! Does he think
removing some measly little weights

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.900
is going to enable him to
outmaneuver Gaara's sand…?

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.310
A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.680
Go, Lee!

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.720
Right!

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:14.570
Go!

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:16.570
Very close!

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.070
Fast!

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.400
Amazing…!

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.880
Because he can't use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu...

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.180
Therefore, he channeled all
of his time,

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.550
all of his energy and...

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.460
all of his being into Taijutsu.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.860
Though he can’t do any other Jutsu…

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.560
He won't lose to anyone…

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.300
He is a Taijutsu specialist!

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.510
I can't believe it!
Gaara's been injured!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.550
No way...!

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.690
Bushy-Brows is even
faster than before!

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.890
Was he this strong?!

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.130
Youth is... explosion!

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.570
Right!

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.010
Over here!

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.510
Good!

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.250
I got him good!

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.190
A-Amazing, he's so fast!

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.820
The Sand Shield can't keep
up with him!

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560
A direct hit!

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:48.690
A-Amazing.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.560
His strikes are lightning fast…!

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.630
I can't even track him
with my eyes!

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.440
Uh oh…

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.350
Uh oh is right!

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.420
That black-circles-under-the-eye
guy is taking some serious blows!

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.420
That's not what I meant.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.250
Huh?

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.600
W-What the…?!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.540
His face is crumbling right off…!

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.010
His whole body is covered
with sand….

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.940
There's not a scratch on him!

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.350
W-What’s with this guy?!

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.520
Sure enough, he was
encased in sand, eh.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.860
But, it's been a long time since

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.030
I've seen that expression
on Gaara's face.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.560
I felt that he was becoming
more and more unstable

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.270
as the Chunin Exam progressed…

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.840
So Gaara's other self has
been awakened, eh?

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.550
Hey! What is that?

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.620
That protected him
against Bushy-Brow's strikes?

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.550
Yes… It's Sand Armor.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:23.950
Armor?

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.560
Ordinarily, the Sand Shield
functions to protect him automatically,

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.560
but, if by chance,
the Shield is penetrated,

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.130
the Sand Armor functions as a second
layer of protection against strikes…

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.800
That's Gaara's…absolute defense!

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.770
Well then, there's no way
to get him!

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.910
He doesn't have any weak points.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.140
No. That’s not entirely true…

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.150
The Sand Armor is actually
riddled with weak points.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.550
First of all, because it's not automatic,
it uses up a lot of Chakra.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.250
It's also less effective
than the Sand Shield,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.560
and it takes an enormous amount
of physical energy

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.560
to keep the sand clinging
to the body like that.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.560
Gaara's having to use the armor...
is proof that he's under pressure.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.800
That Lee is really good…

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.270
But, the outcome of the match
is already a given.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.280
He will never beat Gaara!

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.610
Is that all?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.920
But what an incredible
defense he has...

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.250
no amount of speed is going
to let me get a strike through.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.260
I'll have to do major damage
from above the sand guard.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.760
That will be Lotus!

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:42.930
Yes.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.050
Be ready!

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.960
A thin sand guard like that
will be inconsequential

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.930
in the face of Lee's high-speed
Lotus slamming down from above.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.360
Hurry up and bring it on!

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.570
You asked for it!

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:21.340
He didn’t float.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.540
Not just yet!

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.150
What an amazing series of kicks!

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.820
Even an ordinary Lotus has
a tremendous strain on the body…!

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.890
Lee, let this be the finishing blow!

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.710
Take this!

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.540
Primary Lotus!

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.640
I got him...

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.410
good!

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.710
Right on!

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.750
I-It's over!

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.980
W-What? This can’t be!

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.050
He did it! Lee’s won!

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.250
Hey, he isn't dead, is he?

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.160
Wha--?!

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.470
Huh?!

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.820
What?!

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.830
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:30.400
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:39.980
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:48.250
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:54.860
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.960
You won't have to search around you

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.600
It’s all ok now.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:11.540
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:17.010
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.390
Just sing.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.630
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.960
The two are one

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:39.440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.940
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.250
Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.550
All of your strength seems
to have disappeared!

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.490
You're going to be destroyed
at this rate!

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.690
But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.060
How can he continue to keep up
a fighting stance

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.930
when he's being routed like this?!

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.600
Next episode: "Lee’s Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!"

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.000
The expression in Bushy-Brows’ eyes
has changed!
