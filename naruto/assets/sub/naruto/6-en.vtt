WEBVTT

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.860
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.130
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.540
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.480
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.150
For no single one,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.590
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.150
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.920
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.400
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.780
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.210
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.780
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.290
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.860
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.000
Rockin' my heart

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.320
Sasuke here at Point B!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.620
Sakura here at Point C!

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.530
Naruto here. I'm at Point A!

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
You're slow, Naruto!

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.830
Okay, the seventh squad…

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.900
Hm?!

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.240
The target has moved!

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.940
Follow it!

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.110
Alright! It's over there!

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.490
What's your distance
from the target?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.320
Five meters!
I can go at anytime!

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.390
I'm ready, too!

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.830
Me, too…!

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.830
Okay…

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.330
Do it!

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.800
Uryaaah!

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.270
I got him!

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680
Does he have the ribbon
on his right ear…?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.410
Are you sure it's our target Tora?

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.750
It's the target, no mistake.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.820
Alright, the mission to capture
lost pet "Tora" is complete!

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.820
Isn't there a mission
with a greater sense of urgency?!

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.330
A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.670
Ohhh! My cute Tora!
I was worried to death!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.880
The Wife of the Land of Fire's Daimyo
(Feudal Lord)
		Madame Shijimi and Tora (the Cat)

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.810
Serves him right, that stupid cat!

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.150
No wonder he ran away…

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.850
…Now, then!

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.090
The next mission for
Kakashi's seventh squad is…

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.730
An errand to the neighboring town…
to baby-sit the chief Councilor's boy…

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.520
Helping with digging
for potatoes, eh…

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.890
Nooooo!

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.900
No! No, thank you!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.120
As for me,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.870
I want to do like
a more exciting mission!

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:51.380
Give us something else!

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.780
He's got a point…

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.810
Man… He's a pain!

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.320
I thought it was about time
for him to get fretful…

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.020
You fool!
You're still bottom rookie!

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.740
At the start,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.830
everyone moves up
the ladder

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.830
by gaining experience
from simple missions!

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.530
B-But!

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.070
It's been nothing
but blah missions so far!

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.340
Knock it off!

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.070
Naruto!

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.810
It's necessary to explain to you
what a mission is…

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.110
Listen to me!

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.380
Requests pour into the village
every day.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.820
They range from babysitting
to assassinations…

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.740
A wide spectrum of requests are
recorded on the request list…

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.630
They are separated into A, B, C,
and D ranks in order of difficulty.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.750
In the village,
everyone below me

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.370
is divided up by ability in the order of
Jonin, Chunin, and Genin.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.000
We at the highest level distribute
the requests as missions

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.510
to Ninjas who have abilities
that suit said mission.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.820
And, if the mission is successful,
the fee comes in from the client.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.190
Nevertheless, you guys
have just become Genin…

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.260
rank D is about
the best you can do…

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.870
Hm?!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.800
Yesterday's lunch was pork-bone
broth noodles,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.180
so today will be miso broth…

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.800
Listen!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.740
I-I'm sorry.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.080
Maaaan!
You always lecture me, old man!

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.180
But I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.790
Humph!

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.590
Maaan, I'm going to get scolded later…

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.870
This kid who could only
express himself with pranks…

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.830
Okay, fine!

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:03.410
Huh…?!

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.110
If you insist…

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.080
I'll have you do a Rank C mission…

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.150
You'll be bodyguards for someone.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.480
Really?!

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.820
Ah-ha!

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.020
Who? Who?

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.740
A feudal lord?!

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.320
Or, a princess?!

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.230
Don't get so hasty.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.230
I'll introduce you now!

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.160
Could you please come in…?

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.830
Huh…?!

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.810
What's this? It's just a bunch
of darned squirts!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.080
Huh…?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.020
Particularly you, the smallest one
with the idiot face.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.500
Are you really a Ninja?

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.920
Who's the smallest one with
the idiot face he's talking about…?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.830
What?!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.130
I'll kill him!!

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.750
What good will it do to
kill the old man

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.580
you're supposed to be
guarding, you moron?!

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.820
I'm Tazuna,
veteran bridge builder.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.820
You'll be risking life and limb
in guarding me to the max

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.830
until I return to my land and
complete my bridge!

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.650
All right!

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.660
We're off!!

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.150
What're you so excited about?!

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.410
You see, I've never left
the village before!

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.690
Hey! Am I really okay with this squirt?!

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.570
I'm a Jonin. I'll be watching him.
There's no need to worry.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.000
...okay with this squirt?!

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.210
Anyone but this old dude, man…

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.770
He's really the worst client!

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.570
I'll tell him a thing or two…

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.750
Hey, old man!

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.810
Don't be mocking Ninjas
so much!

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.800
I'm awesome, you see!

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.150
I'm a super-elite Ninja who
will be called Hokage one day!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.920
My name's Naruto Uzumaki.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.620
Remember it well!!

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.160
The Hokage's the super top-dog
Ninja in the village, right?

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.930
You sure as heck don't seem like
you could become the Hokage…

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.610
Aaah! Shut up!

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.770
I'm prepared to do whatever
it takes to become the Hokage!

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.450
You'll have no choice
but to acknowledge me then!!

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.620
I'll never acknowledge you, squirt…

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.350
Even if you become the Hokage!

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.850
What?! I'll kill you!

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.930
I told you to stop it, you moron!

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.830
No! At least let me have
one shot, just one…

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.500
Say…Mr.Tazuna…?

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.910
What is it?

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.610
Your country is
 "The Land of the Waves,"  right?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.910
What of it?

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.910
Say, Kakashi Sensei…

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.920
Are there Ninjas in that land, too?

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.320
No, there aren't Ninjas in
the Land of the Waves…

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.820
But in other nations, while cultures
and customs are different,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.830
hidden villages exist,
and there are Ninjas there.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.200
To the many nations on the continent,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.700
the existence of Shinobi Villages is
a measure of the nation's military strength.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.760
In other words,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.610
that is how these nations maintain
their relationships with neighboring nations.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.980
Even so, the villages are not
under the control of the nations.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.790
They are equal in rank.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.830
On a small island like
the Land of the Waves,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.820
where it is difficult to be
influenced by other nations,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.690
there is no need
for a Shinobi village.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.900
Among the respective nations
that possess a Shinobi Village,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:29.410
the five nations of "Fire," "Water,"
"Lightning," "Wind," and "Earth,"

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.840
due to their large territory and
immeasurable power,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.780
are called the "Five Great Nations."

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.250
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
of the Land of Fire,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.350
the Village Hidden in the Mist
of the Land of Water,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.190
the Village Hidden in the Clouds
of the Land of Lightning,

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.960
the Village Hidden in the Sand
of the Land of Wind,

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.330
the Village Hidden in the Rocks
of the Land of Earth.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.210
Only the leaders of
each of these Hidden Villages

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.630
are allowed to have
the name of Kage, the Shadow.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.010
The "Hokage"
(Fire shadow),"

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.420
"Mizukage" 					(Water Shadow),

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.580
"Raikage"
(Lightning Shadow),

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.780
"Kazekage" 					(Wind Shadow),

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.850
"Tsuchikage"
(Earth Shadow),

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.810
the so-called
Five Kage (shadows),

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.290
reign supreme over
the tens of thousands of Ninjas

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.880
in each nation
of the whole world.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.490
No kidding…
Lord Hokage is that incredible!

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.890
I wonder if that blah old man
is really that incredible…

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.790
Sounds fishy!

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.530
That can't be true! No way!

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.430
Hey!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.070
You guys just doubted
Lord Hokage now, didn't you…?

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.750
Well…don't worry.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.950
There are no Ninja battles
in Rank C missions.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.820
Then, there's no worry of getting
into a scrape with foreign Ninjas…!

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.820
Of course, not.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.840
What?!

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.790
Huh?!

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.110
W-What?

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.750
The first one!

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.830
K-Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.830
The second one…

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.370
The second one…

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:19.810
Ohhh…!

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.820
Hm?!

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.860
It doesn't come off!

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.170
W…Wow!!

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.140
Whoa!

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.040
Ugh!!

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.440
They'll come!

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.810
I have to do it…
I have to!!

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.780
Get back, sir!!

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:25.810
Yo…

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.150
Kakashi Sensei…! He's alive!

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.480
Humph! 					Show off…

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:34.960
Whaa--?!

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.320
Then, what was that…?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.160
So Kakashi Sensei…used Substitutions…

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.070
Naruto…
Sorry I didn't help you right away…

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.030
I got you hurt.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.610
I didn't think you'd be
incapable of moving…

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.810
I was saved, somehow…

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.950
Anyhow, let me just say,
good job, Sasuke.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.520
You, too, Sakura.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.820
I…couldn't do anything…

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.190
but Sasuke…

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.230
It was his first real battle…

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.230
Didn't he feel scared, at all?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.800
He saved me like it was nothing and
without getting any dirt on his clothes…

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:29.370
Hey…

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:30.340
Huh?!

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.810
Are you hurt…

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.410
scaredy cat...?

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.470
Sasuke!

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.820
Naruto!

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.820
These guys have poison
on their claws.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.740
You need to
take out the poison quickly.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.190
What?!

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.800
You have to open the wound and
drain the poisoned blood.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.230
Don't move so much.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.700
The poison will spread.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.160
By the way, Mr. Tazuna…

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.270
W-What is it…?!

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.810
I have something
to talk to you about.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.750
Chunin from the
Village Hidden in the Mist…

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.820
These guys are Ninjas known for
continuing to fight

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.950
no matter what the sacrifice.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.860
How were you able
to detect our movements?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.190
There probably wouldn't be
 puddles of water

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.830
on a clear day like today,
when it hasn't rained for days.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.440
Knowing that, why'd you leave it
to the kids to fight?

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:37.240
If I felt like it,
I could kill these guys instantly…

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.280
But… 					I had to know...

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.020
who the target
of these enemies was…

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.950
Hm?! What do you mean?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:51.920
In other words...

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.830
what I mean is I had to know
if it was you,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:01.030
or one of us Shinobi…
who was being targeted.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.840
We haven't heard anything about
you being targeted by Ninjas.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.820
The content of the request was
supposed to just be

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:13.880
protection from gangs,
thieves, and the like…

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.810
This is a mission with
a B rank or higher.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.700
The request was supposed to be

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.790
for backup protection
until you finished building your bridge…

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.700
If our enemies were to be Ninjas,

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.830
the mission would've been
estimated without question

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.830
as an expensive
 "B Rank"  mission.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.170
It appears there's some kind
of good reason for this,

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.200
but being lied to in the request
won't do.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.540
This is beyond the scope
of our mission.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.540
This mission is too soon for us…

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.250
Let's give it up!

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:51.460
We need an anesthetic to
open Naruto's wound

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.820
and get out the poisoned blood…

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.820
We have to return to the village
and take him to a doctor…

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.820
Hmmm…

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.190
Hm? What...?!

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.830
This sure is a burden!

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.770
Since we need to treat Naruto's wound,
shall we go back to the village…?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.060
Huh!

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.740
Oh!

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.520
Why am I so different?!

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.830
Why's it always me…
Darn it!

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.530
Naruto! What're you doing?!

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.930
I should be getting stronger…

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.800
Here I'm steadily carrying
out missions and

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.500
doing special-skill training
by myself every day…

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.780
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.950
I'll never be afraid
or a be a coward…

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.490
I won't lose to Sasuke…

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.830
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.360
I'll protect you, old man…
with this Kunai knife!!

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.170
The mission continues!!

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.810
Naruto…

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.990
It's all well and good to
rid yourself of the poisoned blood,

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.810
but any more than that and
you'll bleed to death.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.050
Things will get hairy if you don't
stop the bleeding quick... Seriously!

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:43.830
Yikes!

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.840
Argh! No! No!

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.350
I can't die like this, I say!

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.050
Show me your hand.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.750
Nooo! Help me!!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:54.820
Naruto!

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.240
You're really self-abusive,
aren't you!

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.240
That's masochistic!

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.620
The wound is…

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.650
already starting to heal…

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.460
Um…um…

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.960
Am I okay?
You look awfully serious…

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.170
Well…You should be okay.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.810
Is it…the power of
the Nine-Tailed Fox…?

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.820
Did you say you failed?!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.800
I paid a lot of money to hire
you guys

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.590
because you said
you were once hot-shot Ninjas!

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:49.990
Stop your darned grumbling…!!

00:20:53.830 --> 00:21:00.500
Next time, I'll kill him with this…
head chopper!

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.080
I-It's really okay, right?!

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.000
It seems that the enemy
has hired good Ninjas…

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.820
On top of that, a tightened guard
on account of the Demon Brothers' failure

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.710
means that it won't be easy…

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.590
Just who do you think I am?!

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.260
This Zabuza Momochi,
who is called the demon of…

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.830
the Hidden Mist!!

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.790
We've finally landed ashore
in the Land of the Waves.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.090
The guys before were
all well and good,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.730
but there should be even
stronger guys lying in wait.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.780
Okay! I'm going to regain
my honor and continue the mission.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.250
No matter what enemy comes,

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.500
I'll protect the old man
this time around for sure.

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.830
Oh, they wasted no time.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.750
An impressive-looking guy with
a huge Katana has come.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:27.320
Next episode:
 "The Assassin of the Mist!"

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.420
I'm going to kick butt once again!
