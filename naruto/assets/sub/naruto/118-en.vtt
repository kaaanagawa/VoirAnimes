00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.270
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.730
Hurry!

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.890
Right…

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.560
We’re close!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.890
There are two enemies left…

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.350
There are three of us…
lt’s three against two.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.770
We might be able to do it with
one more contact if we do it well.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.350
All right! All right!
Let’s do it!

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.890
No! It’s four against two!

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520
Okay, okay! I’m sorry.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.890
Counting Akamaru,
it’s four against two!

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.150
Let’s finish it quickly with
our new technique next!

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.890
Say, say. If necessary,
I’ll do an awesome Shadow Clone,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.480
so it’ll be okay!

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.850
That’s reassuring…

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.020
But my strategy comes first. Got it?

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.520
Y-Yeah…

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.900
For that purpose,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.730
we have to catch up
before the sun sets at any cost.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.650
I know. Full throttle!

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.480
The sun’s starting to set…

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.060
Neither Jirobo nor
Kidomaru have come.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.770
It seems they’re having
a hard time.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.890
It doesn’t matter…
More important is Lord Orochimaru.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
We’ve only completed one-third
of the journey in half a day…

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.270
They all have Curse Marks, huh…

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.890
No questions asked, huh?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.520
This is gonna be different
than that time before

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.730
with your surprise attack…

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.650
Too much interference…

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.690
Yeah, this is bad…

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.850
We don’t know whether
we’ll make it in time at this rate!

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.520
Damn! We still can’t catch up…

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.060
No, this is good enough.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.810
We’ll maintain this distance
and continue the pursuit…

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.850
Wh-What do you mean?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.890
I mean, we’re delaying
the attack until dawn breaks.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.690
Get real!
We can’t afford such leisure !

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.850
That’s right! Besides, if we’re going
to attack anyway,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.810
isn’t it more advantageous
to use the darkness and attack?!

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.230
For us, the darkness works
to our advantage

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.890
only the moment
we launch the attack.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.850
It’d be close to impossible
to grab Sasuke,

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.770
get away from them and escape
to a safe location

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.060
in just that one moment.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.650
If we couldn’t get Sasuke
back in that one moment,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.850
they’d probably just focus
on guarding the coffin.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.730
If that happens, we wouldn’t stand
a chance in the darkness.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.730
On the contrary,

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.730
for the part where they wouldn’t
have to move needlessly,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.350
suddenly they’d get the advantage.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.900
It’d be a different story
if we had Neji’s Byakugan, but…

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.520
Hey, come on.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.890
Aren’t you forgetting Akamaru’s nose
and mine as well??

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.980
I was sure to include your senses
of smell in the calculations!

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.480
Even so, up ahead they have
the geographical advantage.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.940
Plus…

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.020
if I can’t use my Jutsu,
it’ll be no use.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.150
Even if I seal off their movements
with Shadow Possession Jutsu…

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.650
the effect would be reduced to half
if clouds were to cover the moon.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.060
It’s a drag, but there are too many
dangers, and uncertain elements.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.060
But!

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.100
Got it!

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.270
Naruto?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.890
You’re the leader…

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.980
I’ll follow your instructions, Shikamaru!

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.850
Right. I’m counting on you!

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.440
The Vessel Arrives Too Late

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.310
Hey, Tayuya!
Will we really make it in time?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.310
I was just told to deliver
Master Sasuke by tomorrow.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.890
By tomorrow, huh?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.890
I can’t say that we have
lots of time to spare,

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.520
but I guess we’ll make it in time.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.890
I hope so.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.650
Lord Orochimaru…

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.150
Sasuke…

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.560
No Sasuke…yet?

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.890
He’s running out of time…
He can’t go on any longer.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:52.850
Lord Orochimaru…

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.690
Several bodies have been
prepared for you!

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.890
And…you could even use me,
if necessary…

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.520
It has to be Sasuke…

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.560
How long do you think I’ve waited?

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.310
It’s a matter of urgency!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.020
The Third Hokage’s Jutsu…

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.890
His curse was stronger
than expected!

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.900
Take this! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.900
Wh-What’s this sensation?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.850
Seal!

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.890
My arm…

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.060
If you don’t “reanimate” right now,
you’ll lose everything!

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.060
Is that what you want?!

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.060
Lose everything…

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.480
I’ve selected and prepared
proficient bodies for you.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.440
Please leave it to me! Also…

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.480
I’ll handle the recovery
of Sasuke as well.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.890
Shall I use Kimimaro?

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.900
Curse you …

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.310
Third Hokage!

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.400
Release!

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.230
Listen well, everyone!

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.650
I shall release you from this prison…

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.150
However, it’ll only
be one of you!

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.810
Now all that’s left is to
wake up Kimimaro, huh?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.890
Just as I thought…

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.900
I wasn’t summoned this time, either.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.520
Dr. Kabuto, I…

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.440
Take care of your body.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.190
Your role is now finished.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.890
It’s not Sound Ninja Five now,
Kimimaro…

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.310
I…still haven’t…

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.440
Your replacement has
already been found.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.520
He possesses power equal
to your “Earth” Curse Mark.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.100
He has been given
the “Heaven” Curse Mark.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.270
Additionally, he even
has the Kekkei Genkai.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.890
Wonder who’s stronger…

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.890
What’s the matter?
Don’t get too excited.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.890
Dr. Kabuto…

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.890
M-My life, how much do I have left?

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:23.270
You shouldn’t talk anymore…

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.400
P-People… People are born
with some kind of meaning…

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.690
Since people are born,

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.560
there must be some kind
of important calling.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.770
Recently I’ve started thinking so…

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.560
That the meaning for being born…

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.770
For people, finding the meaning is…

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.400
the only freedom God has given.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.940
I understand what you want to say.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.890
Indeed, Lord Orochimaru
is now suffering.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.730
It’s an unprecedented
difficult situation,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.190
but I’ll mince no words.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.600
What can you do now?

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.940
You’ve now lost your value
as a “vessel.”

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.520
A new vessel is heading this way.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.560
Well…

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.100
At this point in time,
it’s too late, but…

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.020
Okay! You said you were going
to let one person out of here.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.890
You’re going to keep
your promise.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.480
What’re you doing?
Open the door now!

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.940
What? There was another one?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.600
Hurry up and…

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.400
No…I…
I’ll be eaten here, right now…

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.900
I’ll let you out of here…

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.270
And I shall grant you
just one wish.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.560
My clan that was captured
for your experiments.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.890
Please release them.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.600
Sure. Consider it done.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.100
You don’t have to worry.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:41.350
Your strong will is going to remain
as Residual Aura inside me.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.310
It’s not like you’ll lose everything.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.770
Now then, your flesh is mine…

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.480
With this, Lord Orochimaru’s body
will, once again

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.940
be unable to reanimate
for several years.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.810
However, there is the next time.

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:12.650
I-Indeed…

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.600
my body no longer has value
as a vessel for Reanimation Jutsu.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.890
It will now be difficult for me
who has lost everything…

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.890
to find my own calling.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.770
I’ve finally understood that…

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.810
Even if it’s not me,

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:40.190
I’ll bring in the new “vessel”
even if it costs me my life.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.690
That’s my repayment to
Lord Orochimaru…

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.020
That’s the only redemption
for me for being worthless…

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.350
Hold on a minute!

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.190
Are we almost there?

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.560
No… It should still take a while.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.190
More importantly…

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.400
What were those idiots
Jirobo and Kidomaru doing?!

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.850
We caught up!

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.600
All right! I’ll take care of
this nice and quick!

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.690
R-Right away?!

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.560
Eat this!

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:49.980
Multiple Fists Barrage!

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.600
Chakra in his palm…?!

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.890
Shadow Clone Transformation, eh?

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.270
Rasengan!

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.600
N-No way… His hands now…?!

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.350
There’s no point if
I catch you before you do it!

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.730
Now, Kiba!

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.520
Tunneling Fang!

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.890
This was also a Shadow Clone?!

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.020
Luring Sakon into alignment with me…

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.690
and aiming at me from the start?!

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.480
You think you succeeded
just with that?!

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.480
Damn!

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.940
I’ve been nailed.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.650
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:43.890
A diversion…

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.900
He’s coming!

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.890
Tayuya! What’re you doing
idling away?!

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.190
N-No!

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.600
Why do you move forward?!

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.060
I can’t dodge!

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.890
Here you go!

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.690
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.100
Shikamaru! Let’s get out of here!

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.230
Yeah!

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.980
Punks…!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.730
You scums… Messing around with us.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.650
They were full of openings
just as I thought.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.890
Having too much ability individually
is also a problem…

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.560
It went well.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.850
Yeah, it went just as calculated!

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.890
Just in terms of teamwork,
ours was way better than theirs.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.230
I won’t let you get away!

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.310
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.440
And you smiled

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.890
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.850
In my own words

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:40.400
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.890
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.650
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:57.310
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.600
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:10.690
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.890
I feel so sad

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:14.890
But…

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.230
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:20.270
And you smiled

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.940
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.020
In my own words

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.650
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.890
And you smiled

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.310
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.270
In my own words

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.890
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.730
Damn it! To come this far
and have another one appear!

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.560
On top of that, there’s something out
of ordinary about this guy.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.600
What’s this bloodcurdling feeling
on my back?

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.890
Indeed, we are even on numbers,
two against two.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.230
But this…

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.890
I’m sorry, Naruto.
He’s my miscalculation.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.850

A New Enemy Appears!”
