WEBVTT

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
One more time

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you really happy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.810
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:54.680
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.760
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.760
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.760
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.760
One more time

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.770
Where am I?!

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.640
I’ve been saved.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.470
Oh?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.760
Awesome… He’s pretty darn big…

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.140
Oh yeah…

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:25.760
This is a…frog…isn’t it…?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.220
Oopsadaisy…

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.600
Let’s see now…

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.310
No tail!

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.180
This is…!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.020
Not like this one.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.310
Or that one.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.970
It’s really…

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.100
A real…

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.760
Frog!

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.770
He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks!
Chief Toad Appears!

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.760
Looks like he extracted the
Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.760
all on his own this time.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.930
But still, one certainly can’t
say he’s stable yet…

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.760
He overused the large Charka…

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.060
To think that of all the frogs
he summoned that one…

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.310
I did it…

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.760
Hey, you little brat!

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.600
Huh?

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.430
Huh? Huh? Huh?!

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.760
You little brat…

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.220
On whose head do you think
you’re raising a ruckus!

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.760
This is the top of Gamabunta,
the Chief Toad’s head! You idiot!

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760
Quiet down…

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.390
Oh!

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.060
W-What the heck is this guy?!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.850
He seems pretty awesome, but…

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.430
Gimme a break!

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.850
Just when I’m breathing the air of
the free world after a long time,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.310
some weird kid is raising
a ruckus on top of my head.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.680
Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.770
What the heck do
you think you’re doing?!

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.930
Hmm… This doesn’t look good…

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.520
’Cause even I can’t handle
that Gamabunta…

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.390
Jiraiya! Hurry up and
show yourself, you idiot!

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.520
Hmmm…lt would be troublesome if
that Gama found me out…

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.760
I better get my ass out of here
without any further delay.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.560
Hey, little brat!

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.760
Y-Yes…?

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.220
Where’s Jiraiya?

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.060
Huh…? Jiraiya…?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.560
Who’s that…?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.850
I’m talking about that lecher who
calls himself Toad Sage or something!

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.930
Where’s Jiraiya? Huh?!

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.560
S-Scary…

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.680
If you just follow my orders,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.310
I wouldn’t mind making you
my henchman!

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.020
Hurry up and answer me!

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.760
Okay! If you’re talking about
the Pervy Sage,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.100
he’s on the cliff up there,
Chief Toad.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.970
Up there, huh…?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.680
Um… Can I ask you one question?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.220
What is it?

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.520
What business do you have
with that Pervy Sage?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.140
That’s the question I want
to ask that pervert!

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.100
What the heck does he want
summoning me to a place like this?!

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.100
B-But…

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.220
What is it?

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.760
I’m the one who summoned
you, Chief Toad..

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.100
I fell off the cliff…

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.680
and thought maybe you
could come to my aid…

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.100
Please…

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.560
Hmm…?

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.470
What does a kid like you think
he’s saying out of the blue.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.760
There’s no way a little squirt like
you could summon a guy like me.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.640
It’s…it’s true…
I really truly summoned you…

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.760
Believe it!

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.470
You jerk frog!

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.760
Huh…?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.310
You’ve been condescending to me

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.390
and saying whatever you
please since earlier on!

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.680
Since I summoned you,
I’m your master!

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.100
Huh…? What was that?

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.350
Hey, who do you think
you’re talking to?!

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.560
A little squirt like you,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.760
who isn’t even able to exchange cups
of sake as a pledge of friendship,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.020
is saying to Lord Gamabunta,
that you’re his master?

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.930
I could kill you for that! Hey!

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.350
Huh…

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.930
Oohhh…

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.890
It looks like he emerged on top,
that Gamabunta…

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.850
Awesome…

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.760
I hate to tell you this, little brat,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.020
but even if I were to concede
a hundred steps to you…

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.060
No, concede a thousand steps to you,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.810
and even if it really was true that
it was you who summoned me…

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.140
If you’re the kind of guy who
falls off my back that easily,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.020
there’s no way I could
admit you as my master…

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.760
Huh?! Huh…?!

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.760
Now then…I’m here in the
free world after a long time…

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.180
If Jiraiya doesn’t have
any business with me,

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.100
I think I’ll kick back for a while.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.100
Hey! Wait!

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.640
Why don’t you just go home
and sleep or something?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.640
’Cause it looks like you’re incapable
of serving even as my henchman.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.350
Darn it!

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.810
W-What the heck do you think
you’re doing, you little brat?

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.310
If my making you recognize that
I summoned you

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.390
depends on my not falling
off your back, then…!

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.680
Then I won’t get off your back
the entire day today no matter what!

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.020
What?!

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.760
And by my doing that I’ll make
you recognize me as your master!

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.640
You little brat! Don’t get all carried away
thinking I’ll go easy on you!

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:04.850
Huh?!

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.760
Fall!

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.970
Chakra adhesion!

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.760
There’s not enough Chakra!

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.760
Listen carefully, Chief Toad!

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.390
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.270
I’m a man who will become Hokage
in the future. Don’t forget that!

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.270
Who cares!

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.930
This is getting pretty interesting.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.270
Hey!

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.760
Oh my gosh!

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.680
Sorry Naruto,
but I’ve gotta get back to work!

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.600
Research…research…

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.310
Bust off!

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.760
Welcome!

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.350
I'm gonna eat my fill.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:32.470
Huh... Those guys are
eathing barbecue again, huh?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.760
A reward for having trained
earnestly…maybe?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.350
I thought you were told not to
let Gaara out of your sight…

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.390
Don’t worry…
even somebody like him…

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.970
wouldn’t dare to do anything
in broad daylight.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.930
More importantly,
that guy Shikamaru or whatever,

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.390
he’s the first guy
you’re fighting, right?

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.060
Shouldn’t you be formulating
a battle plan?

00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.680
Humph… There’s no way I would
lose to a guy of that level…

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.850
Besides…

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.220
You botched it, didn’t you?

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:03.850
Huh?

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.390
If you had taken the exam
one year earlier,

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.810
you would have made
the Chunin easily…

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.350
Don’t say it…

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.720
What was that?!

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.100
The upcoming Chunin Exam…

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.520
I’ll have the three of you from
our Sand Village take the exam…

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.760
But the reason for doing that
is not to pass the Chunin Exam!

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.850
It is to use the opportunity
of the Chunin Exam…

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.600
to crush Leaf Village!

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.760
But why…? Don’t we have
a treaty with Leaf Village?!

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.430
That treaty is the problem.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.060
Oh.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.350
What do you mean?

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.520
You Genin are not aware of
the detail but…

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.760
At the time the treaty was concluded,

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.060
that idiot feudal lord of Land of Wind
not only aggressively scaled down

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.470
the arsenal of
the Hidden Sand Village…

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.390
he delegated to the Leaf Village

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.930
matters that should have been handled
by our country, and moreover,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:14.220
significantly cut our country's budget
and slashed the number of Shinobi.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.390
When we have an idiot leader,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.850
we, the arms and legs
of the country, suffer.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.560
The only choice we had left
was to improve the quality

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.350
of each and every Shinobi in order
to maintain our country’s military power…

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:30.350
That’s why Shinobi like
you were created…

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.760
Gaara…

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.720
The Land of Wind’s security is
in extreme danger right now!

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.760
But the aides
of that idiot feudal lord…

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.760
don’t have a clue!

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.060
Lord Kazekage ,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.270
who detected the weakening in the military
strength of the Hidden Sand Village,

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.680
joined hands with
the Hidden Sound Village

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.470
and decided to take down
the Hidden Leaf Village…

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.100
In addition to restoring Sand
Village authority…

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.760
this needs to be done in order
to make that idiot feudal lord

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.270
aware of the importance of
crisis preparedness…

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.760
If any more time passes,
our Sand Village will totally lose

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.060
its military capabilities
against the Leaf Village …

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.270
Now is the only chance …

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.100
The success of that mission…
Gaara…depends on your work…

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.810
Yeah…

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.770
If the strategy is carried out,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.930
it will certainly lead to war
with the Leaf Village.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.310
We’ll be at war again…?

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.760
The cost to human life in implementing
the treaty was very great…

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:45.810
and if it is broken…then again…
many people will die…

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.810
H-Hey…Temari…

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.430
This is the will of Lord Kazekage.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.020
Of Lord Kazekage?

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.470
After all, Shinobi are simply
tools for fighting.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.680
The treaty did nothing more than
jeopardize our very existence.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.270
This is a super A-rank mission.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.560
See it through with great care!

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.850
Okay.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.020
Yes…

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:23.430
A day sure is long when
one’s not doing anything.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.140
I guess…

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.890
Darn… What an obstinate little squirt.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.100
Goodness…that Naruto seems
like he’s in agony…

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.060
He must have exhausted
most of his Chakra

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.470
when he summoned Gamabunta…

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.760
Look, look, isn’t that pretty…

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.770
The rainbow…

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.770
Gorgeous…

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.930
Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn’t it.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.760
Good work, Baki.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.560
Lord Kazekage, I successfully
moved all three pawns

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.760
to the real battle as planned.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.760
The agreement with the Sound Village side
has been progressing with no problem too.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.680
Yes, sir.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.350
This is…

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.760
A decisive action plan from
the Sound Village.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.850
You still have something you want?

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.310
Well…

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.760
What is it? Come out with it.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.220
Yes, sir…I was wondering if you
could position some soldiers

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.760
near the border on the pretext of
undertaking a tactical exercise.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.100
With only the four of us…

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.760
The Leaf Village isn’t idiot either.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.760
Their Anbu black ops
are moving about.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.760
If we do that, they will see right through
what we’re contemplating.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.140
But with only our current
military capability…

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.220
That’s why I sent Gaara and
the others out there.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:57.470
The restoration of the authority of
the Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.180
Well… Go.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.850
Yes, sir.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.890
There’s only a little more time remaining
until the sun sets completely…

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:17.270
and if I don’t fall off…

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.760
I’ll be the master!

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.720
What’s that to me?!

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.390
You came up with this
whole thing unilaterally.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.930
I’m not falling off, no matter what!

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.850
That Naruto…
he’s already way past his limit…

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.760
I wouldn’t be surprised if
he fell off any minute now…

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.760
I could simply ignore what
a brat like him says…

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.760
but taking a lick really irritates me.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.140
I'm gonna bring this
to an end once and for all...

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.770
Hey, brat…what’s your name?

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.220
Naruto!

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.270
It’s Naruto Uzumaki!

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.560
Naruto Uzumaki… Naruto!

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.470
Don’t hold it against me if you die!

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.270
Oh…

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.100
That Gamabunta!

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.760
Now it’s a matter of pride for him, too!

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.060
Huh?!

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.270
This won’t do!

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.520
No! This is the sizzling young ladies’
entertainment spot!

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.100
I’m not falling off when
I’m so close to succeeding!

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.520
Hey!

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.220
Oh…

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.560
What?!

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760
That Naruto…

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.430
He’s squeezing out yet more Chakra
from that condition he’s in.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.180
I’m falling…

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.600
How do you like that, Gamabunta?
I’m still on your back!

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.640
It’s my victory!

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.720
Oh no! If he falls like that he’ll die!

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:04.180
Too bad for you… You almost made it.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.680
To think that he could hold out like that
against a tough opponent like Gamabunta…

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.100
Hm?!

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.470
That, Jiraiya, meddling in…

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.600
I am fully aware of the fact that…

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.720
this guy here summoned
me all on his own.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.470
I mean, it’s the first time since
the Fourth Hokage

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.060
that somebody climbed on my head.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.600
As might be expected,
he must be totally drained.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.680
I don’t mind dispensing some
of my power to him but…

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:59.930
Taking him to that place would be best.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.850
Huh? What!

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.310
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.760
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.180
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.560
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:45.850
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:53.220
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.060
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.520
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.760
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.140
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:23.430
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:30.760
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:37.350
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:44.640
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.020
The hospital room
where there is no one.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.060
The uninvited visitors…

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.720
The childhood phantasms
are repeated in the daydream.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.680
The moment when
the forbidden door is opened…

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.060
That guy appears.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.470
Next time, “Hospital Besieged:
The Evil Hand Revealed!”

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.720
Who is the next victim?!
