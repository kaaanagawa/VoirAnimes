WEBVTT

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.730
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.850
Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.270
W-What the heck is going on here?

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.270
Hmm…

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.770
Help me!

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.350
Excuse me there, Mister!
Wait just a moment!

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.600
What in the world is happening?

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.690
You should run away too!

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.400
There’s a monster up there!

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.480
A monster…?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.600
What could it be?
This monster thing?!

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.440
It’s a g-gigantic snake!
lt destroyed the castle in a flash!

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.310
How big of a snake?!

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.020
Me too, at my village before…

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.770
I was attacked by a huge snake!

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.980
We must hurry, Naruto!

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.980
That snake is probably the same one
that you saw before.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.890
Destroy the Leaf Village…?!

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.020
And your answer is?

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.980
Lady Tsunade!

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.980
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.890
Your brother and my uncle
wouldn’t want any of that!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.940
Their wishes…

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.350
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.890
And dreams…
Did you forget them ?!

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.520
I know it!

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.900
Even if you are like this now,
you still…

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.100
Open your eyes! Wake up, please!

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.520
Shut up, Shizune!

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.730
You don’t have to answer right now.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.190
However, I want it in a week.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.890
Also, two human sacrifices are needed
for this Forbidden Jutsu,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.270
so do what you need to do
to prepare them.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.730
Lady Tsunade, let’s kill them right here!
lt’s our chance!

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.890
With you and me, now we can…!

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.400
Lady Tsunade…

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.730
Sure, I am weak now.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.890
However…

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.190
I also know Tsunade’s weakness.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.690
That’s right, he is one of the Sannin
like Tsunade.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:49.650
So he knows that…

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.440
I see it’s not cured yet…

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.400
your fear of blood.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.350
Hemophobia…?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.100
Shall we get going, Kabuto?

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.310
Tsunade… I’ll be expecting
a favorable answer from you.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.890
Looks like we were a little too late…

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.890
Is this that snake’s doing, too?!

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.850
– Let’s go, Naruto! 					– Huh?

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.560
Tsunade isn’t here any more.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.980
Geez, you keep telling me that…!

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.890
Welcome!

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.400
Hey, you ol’ man, give me another shot!

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.890
Lady Tsunade, you’re drinking too much!

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.940
Lady Tsunade…

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.190
Heck, she’s nowhere to be found!

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.520
Dragging me around here and there,

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.350
but after all,
we haven’t found a single trace!

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:32.850
Hmm?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.230
Well, let’s dine here for now.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.980
Huh?

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.270
Isn’t this a pub?

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.690
So what?

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.940
I've told you so many times!
I’m still underage!

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.190
You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.
Kids should only be eating snacks.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.060
– Well then… 					– Welcome!

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.400
There’s no need to dine here!

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.150
We can go to a ramen noodle shop
or something!

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.850
How stupid! You can gather information
in this type of place…

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:12.520
Huh…?

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:13.980
Huh?!

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:16.900
Tsunade!

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:18.890
Jiraiya?!

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.690
Why…are you here?

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.850
I’ve finally found you!
I’m exhausted…

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.900
That gal is Tsunade?!

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.600
She’s 50 years old for real?

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.890
Now, that’s a swindle.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.060
I can’t believe…
I met two of the Sannin in one day.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.400
Here you are!

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.310
In any case…
Today is a day I see many old friends.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.940
You mean Orochimaru…

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.730
What happened?

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.060
Nothing, really.
We exchanged a greeting.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.850
Is it really true that this gal
is the Kunoichi

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.810
who can heal any kind of wound?

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.480
What about you?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.890
What do you want from me?

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.270
I’ll be straight with you.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.940
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.850
Hey, ol’ man,
gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:33.980
All right, in a moment.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.400
The Fifth Hokage?!
What’s this out of the blue?!

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.480
What the heck is going on?!

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.810
Do you know about the Third Hokage?

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.520
The Third Hokage?
So, he really was…

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.890
Orochimaru did it, right?

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.900
I heard about it.
directly from him.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.850
Orochimaru did it…?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.980
Orochimaru?!

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.400
Did he really killed the old man,
the Third Hokage?!

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.440
Who is this Orochimaru?!

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.230
Just like us, he’s one of the Sannin.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.350
Why?! The Sannin are all
from Leaf Village, right?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.650
Then why--?!

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.690
Who’s this brat?

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.150
He’s Naruto Uzumaki.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.890
This brat is…
that Nine-Tailed Fox…?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.890
Hey, you just hold it there!

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.690
I am not done talking yet!

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.150
This Orochimaru?!
This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.190
Who the heck is he?!

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.310
He’s a legendary Sannin, right?!

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.440
Then knowing that…

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.650
why would you, Pervy Sage,
leave such a guy alone?!

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.100
Besides…

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.810
What do you mean this person
is the Fifth Hokage?!

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.020
Naruto, be quiet for a moment.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.350
But…!

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.770
Just shut up!

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.650
I’ll say this again.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:50.890
They are demanding that
you become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.190
So what’s your answer?

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.890
Will you accept it?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.560
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.690
This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.270
What do you say…Tsunade?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.890
Lady Tsunade…

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.980
I really don’t get it!

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.890
Impossible…

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.890
I refuse!

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.810
I remember…those words.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.400
You said those same words
when I asked you to go out with me.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.560
What the heck are you talking about?!
You said it yourself!

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.560
Didn’t you say that
you will bring her back to the village

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.060
and have her treat Sasuke
and Kakashi Sensei ?!

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.770
But what’s this demand
for her to be the Hokage?!

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.600
And, on top of that, she refuses!

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.900
Lady Tsunade…

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.890
Could she be thinking of making
a deal with Orochimaru?

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:55.600
Calm down.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.270
There can’t be no other Fifth Hokage,
but this Tsunade.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.730
During the dreadful Great War Era,

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.100
she contributed tremendously
to the Leaf’s victory.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.890
To this date,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.810
there’s no one who can rival
her combat and medical skills.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.890
Still more, this Tsunade is
the granddaughter of the First Hokage.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.730
So together with her talents,

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.850
there’s no one else more suited
to becoming the Fifth Hokage.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.770
If she becomes Hokage,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:29.600
that means that
she’ll come back to the village.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.190
And then, as I’d told you,
she can treat the two.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.890
Besides, this is what the Leaf’s
top decision-making advisors settled upon.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.560
Genin like you have no say
on this matter.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.940
Jiraiya…

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.560
Unlike your previous apprentice,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.890
this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,
he’s ugly to match.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.940
What?!

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.270
It’s tough on anyone to be
compared to the Fourth Hokage.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:07.150
He had all the qualities to be
the greatest Ninja in all history.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.520
Brimming with talent in Jutsu,
and he had a brilliant mind!

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.600
Popular with people and well…
he was as handsome as me.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.150
But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.900
Risking his own life for the village…

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.440
Life is different from money…

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.980
To easily risk it and lose it,
is a fool’s doing!

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:44.890
Did she say “fool”?!

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.600
Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.890
seemed to want to subdue
the disturbances of war above all else.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.810
But after all, they died in vain,

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.520
in the midst of their dreams
for the village.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.100
You have changed, Tsunade…

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.810
I don’t know what
you thought in your heart before,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.560
but to say such thing out loud…

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.020
Although I look young,
I’m already in my 50s…

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.600
Years change people.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.890
Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei…

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.890
No wonder he died showing off
at that old age!

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.730
Hokage is a bother.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.850
No one but a fool would take it on.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:01.850
Why you--?!

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.150
– Let go of me!
– Don't! We're in a pub.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.270
I said, let go of me!

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.890
Lady Tsunade…!

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.940
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage…

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:15.890
It doesn’t matter if
you are a woman!

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.480
I’ll clobber you with all my might!

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.850
You’re pretty gutsy…
confronting me like this.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.350
Let’s take this outside, brat!

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:36.600
Lady Tsunade!

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.980
Though I may not look it,
I am one of the Sannin.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.560
Why should I even take a Genin seriously.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:18:59.400
What did you say?!

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.650
An advance notice for a KO?

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.980
I don’t mean one minute…

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:13.440
With one finger.
This is enough to take you down.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.890
Lady Tsunade!

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.310
Well…

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.770
Come on, kiddo.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.310
D-Don’t make fun of me!

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.730
Darn it!

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.940
Lady Tsunade!

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.850
Forehead poking?!

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:50.650
Why that no good--!

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.060
She’s strong…

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.020
Hey, brat!

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.980
I’ll ask you one thing before you faint.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.890
Why…get so passionate at
the mention of Hokage’s name?

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.890
Unlike you…

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.520
I will be the heir to the Hokage name,
no matter what!

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.100
Because Hokage is…

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.890
Because Hokage is my dream!

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.100
That kid…

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.980
What? She’s a bit off her guard…

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.440
I can’t tackle her head on.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.480
Then, I should use that Jutsu now…

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.150
Concentrate!

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.230
Oh, no!

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.810
Wha--?! This Jutsu is…!

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.890
Take this!

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.150
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.650
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.810
On your still shoulder

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.440
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.940
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.890
That hold us together

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:57.560
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.150
you say laughingly

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:06.100
but you look most dazzling

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.020
Like a comet,

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:17.230
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:24.440
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:34.890
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:43.730
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.810
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.600
It's been a long time since we drank
alone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.810
I didn't necessarily want to see you.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.890
Don't say that.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.310
By the way,
you're prettier than before.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.770
You haven't changed a bit.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.890
Understand this.
I'm not interested in you.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.770
Neither am I.
After all, you're actually 50 years old--

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.020
– Did you say something?
– No, nothing.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.810
I was just remembering
the old days.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.020
Next time: "Inheritance!
"The Necklace of Death!"
