WEBVTT

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.730
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:00.890
Sasuke…

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850
My, my arm!

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.730
Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.690
Please take this medicine quickly.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.270
Oh, my…

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.400
Just as I get back,
I have to clean the room.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.480
Please make sure you to take
your medicine.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.350
I don't need that kind
of lip service.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.690
It's medicine that I prescribed.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690
The pain should subside
at least slightly.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.560
The pain on this arm
that seems to burn…

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.310
I never thought that it cause
this much suffering.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.310
Sarutobi…known as Third Hokage.
lt's his last curse, after all.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.810
Enough of the talking…

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.480
More importantly,
has that individual been found?

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.690
Yes… She seems to be at a place
called Tanzaku Town.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.900
Tanzaku Town…

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.890
Is that so…?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.690
But the opponent is one of the Sannin,
the Legendary Three Ninjas.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.150
It won’t be that simple.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.890
Good medicine tends to taste bitter.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.440
Here.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.940
It’s the same one…
But this is the trick?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.270
You’re the type who was yelled at
at the academy

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.650
for not having concentration, right?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.230
That doesn’t have anything
to do with me now.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.810
Look at this paper.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.810
Uh?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.560
I’ve seen it.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.770
Fine, then.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.940
Look at it again.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.850
Hmm?

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.940
So what is this?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.560
It’s not something that
I need to explain in length,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.020
but when you first looked
at this blank piece of paper,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.650
you just glanced at
the whole thing, correct?

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.150
Probably.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.890
Then where do you look on this one?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.560
Most likely the point in the middle?

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.440
When a human being looks at
just a blank piece of paper,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.020
he doesn’t know where to look,
so the eyes wander.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.650
But if you put even a single point on it,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.440
the mind focuses there…

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.690
This is concentrating at a single point
and as you focus your mind,

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.270
you become spiritually stable and
you are able to extract unexpected power.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.350
Huh?

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.020
When you opened a hole
on the rubber ball,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.560
you must have been
concentrating desperately

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.100
to fill up the Chakra
in the palm of your hand.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.600
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.480
When you concentrate,
power emerges.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.890
But without a target,
it is difficult to concentrate.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.150
That’s why we have this…

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.850
Listen Naruto, from now on,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.520
when you store up the Chakra
you build in your right hand,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.230
try to store it up by concentrating
on that mark.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.350
Concentrate…

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.560
All right, I’ll try it!

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.890
Focal Point:
The Mark of the Leaf

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.890
Concentrate!

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.100
Darn it. It’s not supposed to be like this.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.890
It has to break like “pang.”

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.480
Concentrate!

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.890
Hello… I’d like to make a little inquiry.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.060
Dang it.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.440
Concentrate.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:45.890
Concentrate!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.400
No good.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.890
Dang it. What does it mean
to concentrate?!

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.890
Damn you, Sarutobi!

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.350
All right then…

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.100
I’m going again to gather
some information.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.810
What…? But you just came.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.350
I don’t have any time to waste.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.480
Hey, hey…!

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.310
Isn’t there going to be even
a little soulful game of catch

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.890
between the master and pupil?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.850
You scoundrel.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.150
Strike!

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.060
Here,  the game of catch is over.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.060
See you later.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.980
Humph… I’ll forget about that Pervy Sage
and work hard by myself.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.600
That’s the only way, Naruto…

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.270
You have to do this training alone.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.190
You have the ability to approach
the Fourth Hokage’s level…

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.100
Grasp it by yourself!

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.890
Hmm… Never seen her.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.520
If that’s the case…

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.350
Sorry to bother you.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.890
I know the person.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.940
As well as where she is right now.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.020
I’ll buy you a drink.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.690
There’s no need.
I was able to win a tidy sum…

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.100
Thanks to that lady.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.230
Yeah…you are indeed
the Legendary Sitting Duck.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.940
She lost again, huh.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.890
Her losses started to pile up…

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.940
So she was talking about
changing her location.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.560
Where to?

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.890
One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,
is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.350
Then this arm can finally…

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.100
Even if it’s good medicine,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.560
you won’t get away with just
a bitter taste with that person.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.190
It’s fine.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.890
Seven, seven, seven…

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.020
Seven, seven, seven…

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.310
Seven, seven, seven…

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.980
Here it comes!

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.890
Congratulations to the customer!

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:16.650
Fever has started
on machine number 44.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.890
Now, please keep on getting it out
like a flood.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.440
Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happen
once in while.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.810
A 3-7 for me?

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.850
Oh wow, lady.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.890
Yeah, what a great work.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.900
Wish I could be favored
by good fortune too.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.890
– Oh, here it comes again!
– Here it comes again!

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.890
Yay…it’s “fever” again!

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.890
A person like me pulls
a big hit like this…

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.230
I have a bad premonition.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.890
I also have some knowledge
regarding Lady Tsunade…

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.730
I did use to be part of
the Medical Corps, after all.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.770
She was the first person to propose
what is now an accepted practice

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.890
of assigning one medical specialist
to a small squad of four.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.980
This was a very revolutionary- idea…

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.890
A small combat unit that doesn’t
even have emergency medical skills,

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.230
what would happen to them in a battlefield
is clearer than seeing fire.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.770
Countless experiences in war

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.690
simply became knowledge
to equip themselves with.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:39.310
Many who were sacrificed
led to the creation of that style.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.850
A person understands the nature
of things for the first time

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.650
after losing them.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:51.230
And the thing created by
one of the legendary Sannin,

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.480
who is known as the medical specialist

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.020
is that sacrifice.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.730
Not working…

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.600
I got to concentrate even more.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.150
Concentrate, concentrate.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.940
Concentrate, concentrate.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:17.890
Concentrate!

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.890
Concentrate…

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.850
Concentrate on one point.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.890
Strike!

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.440
Strike!

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.890
That stupid perve’s face floats up
in my head

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.890
and I can’t even concentrate.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.940
Oh boy…

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:08.150
Some gal somewhere is talking
about me again.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.520
Pinball Games

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.940
Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.890
What’s the matter?

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.650
Your winning this much is like a miracle…

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.890
But you don’t look pleased at all.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.100
This town.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.810
Huh?

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.400
I get a bad premonition.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.230
We’re going to hurry up and leave.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.230
But this is a tourist resort…

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.890
We should take our time and
go see the famous castle and all.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.650
Then we’re going to hurry up
and see it so we can leave.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:38.440
But…Lady Tsunade!

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.850
Lord Orochimaru!

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.400
Let’s get this business over with.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.230
Even if we have to use
a slightly rough method.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.310
I got to do it.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.190
Ouch!

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.890
Ouch… It hurts so much,
I can’t even build up my Chakra…

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.810
He might be reaching his limit soon.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.850
Just a bit…just a bit more rest.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.850
Hey!

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.890
You guys, we’re in class right now.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.890
You…fools!

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.890
You guys have no concentration at all…!

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.650
This is not the way to
become fine Ninja.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.650
How can we stay still at a table,
right, Akamaru?

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.440
I’m hungry.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.100
Sensei, if it’s a scolding,
do it quickly.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.230
What the--?! You, you guys…

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.890
From now, we will have
an after-school lesson

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.060
to teach you guys more concentration!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.890
– What?! 					– What?!

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.060
What’s this?

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.940
You guys are going to do from now

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.890
what the predecessors of
the Leaf Village

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.190
used to perform every day
as a concentration method!

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.150
It is training to build up Chakra

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.440
by concentrating your entire energy
on the leaf on your forehead.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.230
It’s an ancient way of learning

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.270
how not to become distracted
from anything else

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.850
by concentrating on a single point,
the leaf.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.190
The one who hones his concentration
 is truly a great Ninja…

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.890
This is the origin of the Leaf Symbol
on the headband.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.890
That sounds like a lie.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.480
Aren’t you making that story up
to force us to try harder?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.900
I’m not making this up!
lt’s a true story.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.560
Anyhow, can you really become
a great Ninja

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.980
by just polishing your concentration?

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.650
At any rate,
a great Ninja is a guy who’s strong.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:37.190
Hey, you have a point.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.650
This stuff…

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.810
Bye, bye Sensei!

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.440
Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.650
– We won’t wait!
– We don't have time for that!

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.520
Hey! You misfits!

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.810
This is the same thing.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.560
I should have paid more attention
to what Iruka Sensei was saying…

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.150
I’m so stupid.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.440
But nothing will start
if I just keep on regretting.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.230
All right, I’m going to master this!

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.980
Concentrate, concentrate…

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.060
Concentrate!

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:42.230
Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does have
a commanding presence!

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.890
It’s worth being designated
as the cultural heritage.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.940
Don’t dally…

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.190
We’re going to hurry up
and leave this town.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.400
Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully…

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.400
It costs nothing to view.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.890
Lady Tsunade?

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.480
What is this chill?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.020
Now!

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:22.890
What a kid…

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.690
Raising the density in Chakra
to the point that it burns the palm.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.770
He never ceases to amaze me.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.730
It broke.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.100
Good! The second step seems
 to be complete.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.690
Hurry… The third step.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.650
That will come later.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.690
We’ll now go meet Tsunade.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.900
That’s…

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.770
Orochimaru.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.480
I found you.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.770
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.730
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:40.890
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.900
It's a secondary role,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.890
a role in the shadows

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:55.100
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:00.850
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.890
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:20.020
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.440
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.190
I can master the third step while walking?
Give me a break!

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.560
Fool! If we don't hurry it up,
we'll lose Tsunade!

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.150
Besides, she's short-tempered
and impatient!

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.520
Where are we heading?

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.730
If she's here in this town, we'll just
look for her from somewhere high up.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.310
– So we'll climb up a castle.
– Castle?!

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:09.850
– Can't you see over there?!
– Which way is "over there"?

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.890
I'm saying…

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.850
Oh! What the--?!

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.150

The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart"
