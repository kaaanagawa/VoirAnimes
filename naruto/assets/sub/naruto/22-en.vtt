WEBVTT

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.690
C'mon!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.630
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.310
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.980
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
For no single one,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.460
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.730
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.370
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.340
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.810
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.890
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.590
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.600
Rockin' my heart

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.590
Hey, you there.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.050
Identify yourself.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.290
I'm not obliged to answer…

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.760
What…?!

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.460
Cute…

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.600
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats…

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.810
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.110
Yeah...

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.580
It appears this year's
test-takers will be amusing.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.910
For us proctors too, eh…

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.590
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.420
Don't pull.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.660
Sasuke… Sasuke Uchiha, eh.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.570
Does that kid concern you?

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.970
Hmph…

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.650
Lee, let's go.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.280
What're you doing?

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.120
You guys go on ahead.
I have something I want to check out.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.920
What's that about?

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.390
Why should I know?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.400
You, with the unpleasant look.
Wait a minute!

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.770
Huh?

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.510
– Oh! 					– Yikes!

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.680
What is it?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.780
Why don't you fight with me
here now?

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.090
Chunin Challenge:
Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.860
A fight here now…?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.490
Yes.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.800
My name's Rock Lee.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.010
When asking a person their name,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.370
I'm supposed to give
my own name first, right?

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.240
Sasuke Uchiha…

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.180
Hmph… So you knew?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.420
I want to fight with you!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.590
I want to test out how effective
my techniques will be

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.790
against the descendant of the
clan reputed for genius Ninjas.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.590
Also…

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.300
Sakura. Love.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.570
Noooo!
Those lower eyelashes are awful!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.540
The hairstyle is awful, too!

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.580
Those bushy eyebrows,
just too intense!

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.710
Everything is...!

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.280
You're an angel!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.020
Noooooo!

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.590
You are good at it.
Then, how about...?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.580
Really... That was super close.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.020
You! Don't throw strange stuff!

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.580
I was dodging for my life!

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.050
You don't have to resent me that much.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.490
It's Sasuke again!
Darn it! Darn it!

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.600
To be honest, you're a naive one,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.170
knowing the name of Uchiha
and challenging me.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.570
Do you want to realize
what this name is , Bushy-Brow?

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.570
I insist.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.540
I'm lucky...

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.350
to be able to have a bout with
the number one rookie right away.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.280
And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.220
Wait!

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.530
I AM going to take out
the Bushy-Brow. Believe it!

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.330
Hey, you…!

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.470
Big deal.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.500
I'll be able to take care of him
in just five minutes!

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.810
The one I want to fight isn't you…
lt's Uchiha.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.610
All these people…

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.580
keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.
How annoying!

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.260
Darn it!

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.530
Leaf Whirlwind!

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.010
As I thought, he's strong…

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.580
I declare. You are absolutely
no match for me.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.920
Because…

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.990
among the Leaf Village Genin,
I'm the strongest now.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.500
He stopped my kick…

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.170
What's with that Chakra in his arm…?

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.670
Interesting. I'll do it.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.040
Oh…

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.250
Stop! Sasuke!

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.250
There's less than thirty minutes
until the 3:00 registration.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.620
Don't worry.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.920
It'll be over in five minutes.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.990
Here he comes!

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.590
I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.400
I may end up breaking the taboo.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.830
I may end up using…
that technique!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.140
Leaf Hurricanes!

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.580
I can't get completely out
of the way…

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.410
Guard!

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.150
What…?!

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.280
Sasuke!

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.490
W-What's going on?

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.130
But…he did guard himself
just now, no mistake.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.600
He got around my guard.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.970
What is it?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.670
Is it Ninjutsu…?
Or is it Genjutsu…?!

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.910
As I thought, he's going to get up!

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.580
Hmph… That's okay.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.580
If that's the case,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.850
this is a good opportunity
to get used to THAT.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.950
I'll do it.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.590
Huh?! C-Could that be…?

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.400
Sharingan!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.000
Sasuke, when has he...
Why is that in his eyes…

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.370
And in both eyes…!

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.310
Is that the Sharingan?

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.450
Sasuke's awesome, after all!

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.750
If this is the same Kekkei Genkai
as Kakashi Sensei's…

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.290
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.730
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu…

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.800
It's some kind of magic either way…
I'll reveal that!

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.540
It feels like Sasuke's rapidly
getting stronger.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.640
That's to be expected
of the Uchiha clan.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.210
That's right…
Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:35.750
Huh?!

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:37.560
The Sharingan…!

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.790
To not be able to discern the Jutsu
with the Sharingan…

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.590
Could it be…that his technique is…!

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.930
That's right…

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.900
My technique is neither
Ninjutsu nor Genjutsu.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.570
S-Sasuke!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.410
That's right!

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.590
My technique is
mere Taijutsu…Sasuke.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.590
You may not be able to
believe it just like that, but…

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.590
Punk!

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.500
It's said that the Sharingan has
the ability to spot

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.570
all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.140
Make no mistake,

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.940
the Sharingan reads Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu that

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.010
require the principle of building up
Chakra and weaving Signs,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.210
and can most surely handle such Jutsu.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.580
However, only Taijutsu is
a little bit different…

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.680
W-What do you mean?!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.120
Even if you can spot my movements
with the Sharingan,

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:49.590
your body is not equipped with
the speed to respond to my Taijutsu.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.130
In other words, even if you understand
with your eyes,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.170
there's nothing you can do if your
body can't keep up.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.300
Do you know?

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.540
There are two types of strong people,
genius-types and effort-types.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.680
If your Sharingan is
a genius-type drawing Uchiha ability…

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.550
I'm an effort-type who has
patiently mastered only Taijutsu.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.190
In a manner of speaking,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.690
your Sharingan and my ultimate
Taijutsu have the worst compatibility…

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.290
Guard!

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.670
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow…!

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.610
And I shall prove it with this technique.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.380
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.580
W-What's he going to do…?!

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.020
It's my victory!

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.030
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.000
And I shall prove it with this technique.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.970
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.240
W-What's he going to do…?!

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.570
It's my victory!

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.010
Huh?!

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.580
– Huh? 					– Huh?!

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.720
That's…!

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.590
That's as far as it goes! Lee!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.730
W-What is it…?
What's going on?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.530
Sasuke!

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.010
Sasuke was beaten?!

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.580
What happened while
I was knocked out?!

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.180
Are you okay?! Sasuke.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.590
He's agitated…
To think he couldn't fall properly.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.860
Y-You were watching…?

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.530
Lee! That technique just now
is prohibited, you know!

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.170
W-What's with that turtle…?

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.570
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to…

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.310
He's…getting scolded or something…

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.580
Could that be…Bushy-Brow's teacher?!

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.590
B-But, of course,

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:34.630
I didn't even remotely have
a mind to use the Hidden technique…

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.590
There's no mistake!

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.960
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.830
Hey-hey.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.330
What…?

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.470
That thing… It's a turtle, right…?
Right?

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.340
Isn't it obvious?!

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.340
Say! Say! Can even a turtle
become a Ninja teacher?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.240
I don't know!

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.580
Fool!

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.650
You think such subterfuge will work?!

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.590
You should know very well what
it means

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.590
for a Shinobi to give away
his technique!

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:07.590
I…I know.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.630
To think I lost to someone so flippant…

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.570
Have you prepared yourself?

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.110
Y-Yes sir…

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.580
All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.680
Man! Life treating you good, huh?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.720
Huh?!

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.230
Whoaaa! An even more
intense guy has appeared!

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.260
Yo, Lee!

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.030
Super intense.
The extreme bowl cut...

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.000
T-Those are some incredibly
raging brows…

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.800
I've never seen anything like that
in my life.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.580
H-Hey! You guys!
Don't mock Guy Sensei!

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.680
Shut up!

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.580
I'm at a loss for a reaction because

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.450
of those bizarre things appearing
one after another!

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.580
What?!

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.180
Hey, Lee! Drop it!

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:10.390
Yes, sir…

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.630
Idiot!

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:30.810
Lee, you…you…

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.810
S-Sensei…!

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.080
L-Lee…

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.680
Sensei…I…I…

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.590
Enough, Lee!
Don't say anything!

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.360
Sensei!

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.590
Lee!

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.600
I lost to a guy like that…

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.640
Yes…this is adolescence!

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.470
Sensei!

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.740
That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.750
I-Idiot! That's dangerous!
Very dangerous!

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.020
It's okay, Lee!

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.720
Mistakes come with adolescence.
Don't worry about it!

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.790
You're so kind…Sensei!

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.630
Now then, take a hundred laps around
the Training Field toward that setting sun!

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.500
Yes! Sensei!

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:41.180
Let's go!

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.080
Yes, sir!

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.350
Hey, wait a minute.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.580
We're still in the middle
of the conversation!

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.590
What're you going to do
about the Chunin Exam?!

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.460
There's no time!

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.990
Huh? Oh, that's right…

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.530
Lee, you will be punished for attempting
to break the prohibition on top of fighting…

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.370
in principle, after
the Chunin Exam.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:06.340
Okay!

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.370
Five hundred howls of adolescence!

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.310
Yes, sir!

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.750
Idiots…

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.550
Say! Say!

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.920
By the way, what's with that turtle?

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.590
If I'm not mistaken, those kids are…

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:23.950
Kakashi's…

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.720
Oh! No, he's looking this way!

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.600
You guys…how's Kakashi Sensei?

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.460
You know Kakashi…?

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.430
I know him all too well.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.710
People call us…
eternal rivals.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.880
Sounds like a lie!

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.680
What're you saying?!
Guy Sensei really is…

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:48.980
That's fine.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.250
"Action speaks louder than words"
anyway.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.120
Huh?!

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.790
By the way, my record is fifty wins
and forty-nine losses.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.590
Huh?!

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.960
This guy…

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.500
When did he...?

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.000
One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi…

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.840
N-No way…

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.910
He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!
ls he human…?!

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.580
How about that?!
Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.080
Darn it…

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.590
This time around,
Lee caused the trouble.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.250
Out of consideration for my face,
forgive him.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.590
Out of consideration for
this pleasant face.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.930
He's better than that Kakashi…?

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.600
Darn it! He's…

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.900
not just all talk…

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.140
You guys and Lee should probably go
to the classroom pretty soon.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.180
He...!

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.590
Then, do your best, Lee!
Farewell!

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.590
Yes, sir.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.590
What?!

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.590
Sasuke…

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.900
I have one last thing to tell you.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.570
I actually came here to
verify my own ability.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.840
I lied before.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:30.080
The strongest man of the
Leaf Village Genin might be on my team.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.590
I'm entering in order
to defeat that person.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.120
And, you are one of my targets.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.600
Please prepare yourself for the Exam!

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.570
Sasuke…

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.110
Ha! So…

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.580
I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.020
Naruto!

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:07.580
Shut up!

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.890
I'll knock him flat next time!

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.590
Ha! That from someone
who just got whipped.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.860
Hey…what's your problem?!
Naruto, you!

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.570
You saw it, didn't you? His hand…

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.580
That Bushy-Brow probably did a heck
of a lot of special training.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.340
Day after day…

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.580
More than you have…

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.450
That's all it is.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.590
Sasuke…

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:00.970
Interesting…

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.570
Hmph!

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.180
It's starting to get interesting…
the Chunin Exam!

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.680
What's next?

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.580
Yeah!

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.220
All right!

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.690
Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.060
Yeah!

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.260
Whoaaaa!
There are tons of people here!

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.700
Are they all here to take
the Chunin Exam?

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.200
Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba,
Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.700
So you're all here, too?

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.540
Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.540
Open up your eyes and watch me
become the Hokage!

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.580
Next episode:
"Genin Takedown!
		All Nine Rookies Face Off!"

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.590
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
