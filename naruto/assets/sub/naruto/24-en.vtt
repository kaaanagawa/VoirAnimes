WEBVTT

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.560
C'mon!

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.560
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.830
Being chased by something

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.240
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.910
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.650
For no single one,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.520
To none does belong,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.660
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.530
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.930
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.300
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.270
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.740
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.310
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.820
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.520
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.530
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.530
Rockin' my heart

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.890
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for
the first test of the Chunin Exam.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.530
You, from Hidden Sound Village!

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.270
No doing as you please
before the Exam!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.800
You want to be failed
at the get go?!

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.480
Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,
so we flipped out... despite ourselves.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.020
Hmph. This is a good opportunity,
 so I'll say this.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.690
There will be no battles,
competitions and the like

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.390
without the permission
of the proctors!

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.890
And even if you get permission,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.290
actions that could lead to the death
of an opponent will not be permitted.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.900
Any pig that screws with me
will be disqualified immediately.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.970
Got it?!

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370
This Exam looks to be easy!

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.180
Now then, we will start
the first test of the Chunin Exam!

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.380
Turn in your applications,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.820
take one of these number cards
in exchange,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.220
and sit in the seat
matching that number!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.820
After that, we will hand out
the paper for the written test!

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.730
Written...? Paper...?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.860
Paper...

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.570
A paper test?!

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.610
Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.520
Everyone's seats are all scattered...
What should I do?

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.030
He's deflated, deflated...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.700
It's the worst type of test for Naruto...

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.870
Naruto...

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.770
Oh! You are Hinata...!
Since when have you...?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.210
L-Let's both do our best.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.850
Y-Yeah.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.120
I didn't notice her at all.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.520
Hinata has no presence at all...

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.830
There are several important
rules to this first test.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.600
I will take no questions,
so listen well accordingly!

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.270
Rules? No questions will be taken...?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.740
First off is the first rule!

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.910
You are given ten points
each from the start!

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450
The written test has
ten problems in all!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.980
Each problem is one point.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.520
And, this test is a
point deduction system.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.020
You are deducted one point for
each problem you get wrong!

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.990
If you get three wrong,
you'll have seven points!

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.190
If I get ten wrong,
I'll have zero points...

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.330
The second rule.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.530
Pass or failure will be determined

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.530
by the total points of
the three-person teams.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.310
W-Wait a minute!

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.340
What do you mean...
total points of the teams?

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.510
Shut up!

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.510
There's a perfectly
good reason for this!

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.020
Shut up and listen!

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.520
Reason...?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.150
If you've got it,
here is the most important next rule!

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.620
Those who are deemed by
the sentinels

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.230
as having committed an act of
cheating or something similar to that...

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.600
will have two points deducted
 for each act.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.700
What...?

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.570
Oh!

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.240
In other words...

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.670
there may be those who will be
dismissed during this test

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.940
without waiting for test grading.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.680
This means they're deducting points

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.150
from things other
than the written test problems.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.150
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating...

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.690
will bring ruin upon yourselves.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.690
I'll check you anytime.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.560
If you aspire to become
a Chunin at all,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.530
know that Shinobi should act
like exemplary Shinobi.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.640
Relax...! 					Yes... yes!

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.510
Naruto aside,
Sasuke and I are okay!

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.510
Even if Naruto gets zero points...
if we cover that...

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.520
And, in the case of even one person
on the team getting zero points...

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.820
Everyone on that team will fail!

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.690
Wha--?!

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.390
What did he say...?!

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.530
I feel two menacing stares...

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.660
Naruto?

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.030
By the way, the last problem will
be given forty-five minutes

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.500
after the start of the test!

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.240
The time for the test is one hour.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.840
Begin!

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.050
Could it...

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.490
Could it be that,
the fat is really on the fire now...?

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.590
Naruto...!
Just don't get zero points!

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.900
Naruto isn't getting jitters
from the get go, is he...?

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.870
This is bad...

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.540
As if!

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.610
I know I've cleared many obstacles
like this before...

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.010
At times like this, one should
look at all the problems

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.510
without feeling pressed
or making a fuss!

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.350
And then with utmost effort

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.050
I should tackle the problems that look
easy to understand!

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.420
Let's see, the first problem...
is a code text, eh...

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.530
Excellent, I say!

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.960
Next! Next!

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.030
Let's see... the second problem...

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.740
The parabola B in the diagram illustrates
the greatest possible distance

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.510
Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shuriken
from a tree seven meters high...

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.510
Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja's
character inferred

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.980
from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.850
also answer the longest firing range
in battle on flat ground

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.990
and explain your basis.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.490
T-This is an... integrated problem based
on predictions

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.530
of uncertain conditions and
dynamic energy analysis application...!

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.030
There's no way
Naruto can solve this!

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.100
I mean...

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.470
hardly anyone except me
can solve this problem!

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.510
Okay, next! 					Next!

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.150
These other problems...
are nothing but difficult ones.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.590
I see...

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.860
I don't... understand even
one of these problems.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.640
Oh, no, this is bad!

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.470
For real! For real!

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.570
What should I do?
What should I do? What should I do?

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.290
If about ten of all fifty-one teams
are able to pass,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.530
it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself and
get a considerable amount of points.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.260
It's like a system inviting cheating...

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.530
I hope Sasuke and Naruto
won't panic and cheat.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.970
It's okay...
Naruto's not that much of an idiot...

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.810
I know that...

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.440
Don't panic...

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.510
For now, all there is to do is to be
very, very cautious...

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.620
and cheat without being found out!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.390
No! No! I can't, that's no good,
no good!

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.530
I can't tread on such thin ice!

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.530
At any rate, this elaborate fuss...

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.500
It's like a trick assuming
that we're going to cheat.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.140
They probably check with that paper...

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.610
Somebody got nailed.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.510
Cheating deducts two points.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.380
Two-point deduction, huh...

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.520
Ordinarily, it'd be failure the moment
the cheating was discovered...

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.600
Know that those who
commit awkward cheating

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.270
will bring ruin upon themselves.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.510
Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.610
I see, so that's how it is, eh.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.080
This wasn't just an achievement test!

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.950
The real aim was...

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.520
a test to see the ability
for intensive information collection

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.520
with the full use of deception
and concealment techniques.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.360
"Shinobi should read
 the double bluff," eh...

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.060
In other words, the true intention
of the proctor is...

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.530
if you're going to cheat,
not "awkward cheating,"

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.970
but "like exemplary Shinobi",
don't get caught.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.310
Viewed in this light, the extraordinariness
of the point deduction system,

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.950
the lenience of only deducting two points
for each discovery of cheating makes sense.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.380
In other words,

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.520
what's being tested here is how
we can gather the correct answers

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.390
without having our cheating detected
by the proctors or

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.390
by the one being cheated on.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.830
Realize it quick, Naruto!

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.200
It'll turn into a fatal mistake!

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.770
Realize it!

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.510
This is bad. Believe it...

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.880
If the purpose of this test is seeing
the ability to gather information...

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.850
then there should be someone
in this classroom somewhere...

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.590
who knows the answers
to the problems!

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.070
So Gaara has also started, eh...

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:04.600
Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:24.350
Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!
Next is problem four!

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.900
Judging from this rhythm...

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.770
The stroke order...
and the number of strokes...

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.240
I see.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.290
Okay! Please tell me.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:07.530
Eight, huh.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.680
Lee, if you can see it,
wear your headband!

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.970
Time is rapidly going by!

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.440
Oh, man! I'm afraid all there
is to do is cheat...

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.940
But, if I'm discovered,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.080
it'll be trouble for Sakura
and Sasuke.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.350
On the other hand,
if I get zero points...

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.450
Sakura and Sasuke will be
my companions in failure.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.450
Naruto...

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.090
I'll show you... my test.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.230
Huh...?

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.260
What is Hinata saying...?

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.970
W-Why would she do
such a thing for me?

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.510
Could it be... some kind of trickery?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.180
But Hinata is not one to do
something like that...

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.580
No... But she might've been coaxed into
attempting to trap me by Kiba and others...

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.950
Hinata, let me ask you one thing!

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.050
Huh?!

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.290
Why would you show me?

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.530
Uh... uh... actually...

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.500
I...I...

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.280
I don't want you, Naruto...
to leave at this stage...

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.550
Y-You see...
the nine of us are the only rookies...

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.520
and I have many anxieties about
what's to come, so!

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:19.530
I get it now! I was kind of
strangely suspicious of you!

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.140
Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.270
Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.450
W-What was that?
I was about to turn...

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.990
W-What was that for, sir?!

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.200
You made five mistakes. You fail!

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.230
N-No way...

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.740
His two buddies, both of you get out
of the classroom, right now.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.520
♪ 23 fails!

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.990
♪ 43 and ♪27 fail!

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.520
Noooo!

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:26.260
Hey, hey! Do you have proof that
I cheated five whole times?!

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:30.600
Really, are you guys properly checking
this number of people...?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.940
Listen up...

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.510
Even among us Chunin, we're elite
who were selected for this Exam.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.510
We don't overlook you blinking once...

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.190
In a matter of speaking,
this strength is the proof.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.060
Naruto...?

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.860
Hurry... Look...

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.180
Hinata... You don't get it, do you?

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.350
What...?

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.520
An awesome ninja like me
won't cheat. Believe it!

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.990
N-Naruto.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.230
B-But...

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.300
Also, if something went wrong,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.140
you'd be in a hot spot for
helping me cheat, right?!

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.270
\What?!

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.510
Naruto...

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.350
I'm... sorry...
I-I did something uncalled for...

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.520
Nah, it's okay.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.560
I...went and acted big.

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.160
What should I do?
I'm extremely stupid.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.700
Byakugan!

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.740
Sharingan!

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.270
I'll copy all his movements!

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.950
My hand is moving fluently...

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.310
I hit the jackpot straight away
with this guy.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.150
Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.860
I'm acknowledging that your smarts

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.790
and the width of your forehead
are exceptional.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.530
So you should thank me.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.530
Thank me for getting to be
the target for this Jutsu.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.600
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.710
So Ino... started using that Jutsu...

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.650
There's no countering that spell of Ino's...

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.820
Sakura, I let myself move
into your mind for just a little bit.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.930
I have to memorize the answers quick.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.760
I've got to pass these answers
to Shikamaru and Choji.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.570
♪ 59! Fails!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.140
♪ 33! ♪9!

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.470
This is the thirteenth group to fail.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.780
♪ 41 fails.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.950
♪ 35, ♪62 fails!

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.180
No way!

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.820
That brat...

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.520
He coolly proceeds through this
ruckus without moving an eyelash.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.790
Very well done considering he's new.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.580
The optic nerves are connected...

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.510
The third eye... open!

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.260
Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.100
Dang it...!

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.020
Excuse me.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.350
What is it?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.520
I need to go to the bathroom...

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.160
We will accompany you
to the bathroom.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.290
I see...

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:59.900
Anyhow... the proctors are
nothing so special!

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.040
They don't realize that the proctors
have increased by one...

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.510
Eh, don't you think so...

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.480
Crow...?

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.290
Forty minutes have passed
since the test started...

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.490
Twenty minutes left... huh...

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.220
Since it's come to this,

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:25.230
it's the last problem to be given
forty-five minutes after the start of the test.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.330
All there is to do is bet on this.
Believe it!

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.530
Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for life
once I get it wrong?!

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.100
Really? Really? Really?

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.200
If I don't take it, I'll fail with
my comrades immediately?

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.800
No way, no way, no way.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.870
The hopeless rule for problem ten!

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.540
Not good, not good, not good.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.940
No way can I choose which one!

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.680
What to do, do, do, do.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.350
This is seriously, seriously bad!

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.650
Bad, bad, bad, bad.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.520
