WEBVTT

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.810
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.060
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.360
One more time

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.060
Are you really happy

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.610
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.310
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.980
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.610
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:54.850
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.850
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.900
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:18.060
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:26.850
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.900
One more time

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.360
That darn Naruto…

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.230
Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.810
– C’mon!
– Hurry up with the match!

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.980
Finish it up already!

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.940
Stand up and start the match!

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.850
Evidently, people don’t want to
see the minor players’ matches

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.020
since they were really looking
forward to Sasuke’s match…

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.650
If people aren't expecting anything
exciting from this battle,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.850
makes no sense
for me to have it.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.520
What? You’re giving up, too?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.850
My opponent’s a girl again?

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.440
Hey, why aren’t you moving?!

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.520
C'mon, get started!

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.480
That kid has had zero fighting spirit
from the beginning…

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.400
C’mon! What is he doing?!

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.650
C’mon Shikamaru!
Get it together and do it!

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.940
If you don’t come, I’ll go!

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.560
Hey! Haven’t started yet…

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.850
Man, that girl is so gung-ho.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.730
It doesn’t really matter if
I become a Chunin or not.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.850
But there's no reason why
a man should lose to a woman.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.980
Well… let’s do it!

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.850
This guy’s quick to run away…

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.400
Nor any reason why a man should
rough up a woman.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.850
But I don’t want to be
roughed up either.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.560
He’s the kind of Ninja that
uses shadows.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.730
Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.850
He’s probably trying to lure me into
the trees where there're lots of shadows…

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.770
but I won’t let him.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.190
Why am I the only one who always
gets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.020
Shikamaru! You get her with
a torrent of 16 combination…!

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.770
Mind if I sit here?

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.610
Huh?

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.650
What…you?
Your stomach okay?

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.860
What? Wasn’t Sasuke’s match next?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.230
Shh!

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.230
Everything’s fine, right, Sakura?
After all, it's Sasuke, right?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.650
R-Right now, I should leave her alone.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.440
It looks like Shikamaru taking part
in this final battle,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.520
it seems like he's in the wrong place.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.400
Don’t say that!

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.980
I certainly don’t think that
he has any great techniques,

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.060
but that Shikamaru is
always good at strategizing.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.310
That’s why I feel like we ended up
in the preliminary round the other day.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.770
Hmm, yeah well…

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.900
And after all, he jumped down
into the arena himself.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.860
He seems uncharacteristically driven.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.190
Even he can be passionate
once in a while!

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.310
Go! Shikamaru!

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.940
Geez, I envy a cloud being so free…

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.150
I guess I pretty much
am completely without desire…

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.770
Even the reason why I became a Ninja…

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.770
was because I thought
I would have a fun life, ya know…

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.980
Get it together!

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.860
C’mon Shikamaru!

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.940
But…of course, it’s not that easy.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.850
What’s going on with that stupid face?!
ls he underestimating me?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.850
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
That’s right, with this attack,
my armed attacks also were beaten down.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.810
I see…

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.110
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
I’ve seen that true identity!

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.650
Evidently there’s a limit to
the stretching and shortening,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.110
changing shape of the shadow…

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.810
No matter how much you
change the shape of the shadow,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.810
even when you stretch it,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.560
it can only span up to
the size of your own shadow.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.560
That’s right isn’t it?

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:54.520
You got it…

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.520
Even if I assume that he's made up
the distance,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.110
by stretching his shadow from the edge
of the shadow of the arena wall…

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.150
This is the limit to how far
the shadow can stretch.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.810
This is the scope of his attack!

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.440
15 meters, 32 centimeters!

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.310
She took the distance
with the folding fan.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.230
Temari is stronger at long distance
battles than she is at close range…

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.150
the outcome has already been decided.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.810
What? What is that sign…?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.770
That’s no sign. That’s like, his habit.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.940
Habit…?

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.690
He enjoys passing time slowly.
That guy’s like an old man.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.360
That’s why he likes
Japanese checkers and chess

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.360
and always makes me be his opponent.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.850
When he’s stuck on a move,
he always does that.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.190
Why?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.230
He’s working out his strategy.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.400
And, I’ve never beaten him.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.690
A strategy…
but this is an actual fight.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.480
It’s different from a game.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.060
But it's said that formation pieces
that were used to build battle strategy

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.440
eventually become
game pieces.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.520
Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.150
Wait a minute.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.850
When we grouped the Genin,
I saw his scores.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.980
They were at about the
same level of that Naruto’s.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:11.860
He said that moving his pencil during
written exams at the academy is a pain,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.690
and during the tests,
he always sleeps instead.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.810
A pain…?

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.150
He was so good at strategy games,
I felt something wasn’t right…

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.850
so I had him take an IQ test
under the pretense that it was a game.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.610
And… how did it turn out?... …

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.850
He was more than brilliant.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.400
With an IQ of over 200,
he’s a super genius!

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.690
T-Two hundred?!

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.440
He’s done thinking…
lt starts now.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.230
Looks like you’ve got some
fighting spirit now…

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.360
It’s pointless to hide!

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.850
I wonder if he’s really got a strategy…

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.270
M-Maybe…

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.860
With that he has no approach!

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.360
Shikamaru! Go for it!

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.400
It’s pointless, isn’t it?

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.690
He’ll give up soon.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.150
He hates things
that are a pain in the butt.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.190
You're wrong!
At least, I hope so…

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.610
But you may be right…

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.270
How long are you going to run away!
Cut it out!

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.150
It’s no use.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.360
As long as I’m on the
outside of this line,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.850
he absolutely can’t catch me…

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.900
No, wait! Close call!

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.190
You caught on well.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.850
So you were dragging your feet
to wait for the sun to set…

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.610
in order to make the surface
of your own shadow larger

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.650
by stretching the shadow line of the wall.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.850
As the sun goes down,
the shadows lengthen.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.850
Isn't that so?

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.810
That was close! Shikamaru…

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.850
But why is he using shadows?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.520
After all, Shikamaru is inside
the shadow of the field.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.850
If there’s even a little bit of light,
he can make a shadow within a shadow!

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.440
You don’t know a thing
about Shikamaru!

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.360
A shadow…in a shadow…?

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.900
Even if I calculate the height
of the sun now

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.850
and the limit to the distance
of the previous attack,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.020
there's no mistaking the distance!

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.400
Temari! Up!

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:35.980
I see.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.560
What’s this?!

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:42.850
Darn it!

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.520
I won’t let you escape!

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.310
I didn’t expect that he would
create extra shadows to reach me

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.020
by making a parachute with his jacket…!

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.810
He’s impressive.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.610
Once I notice the parachute from above,
I’ll take my attention off from my feet.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.850
That’s a sneaky trick to catch me
off my guard!

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.520
However, now it’s clear.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.650
Shadow Possession Jutsu is

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.360
one in which other shadows are used
to get your opponent,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.850
a skillful technique!

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.940
She’s dodged this trick too…

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.860
Not careful enough in the final stage.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.810
And his opponent is fairly analytical.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.860
She’s good at thinking ahead.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.270
If this battle takes too long,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.060
the shadows in the arena will grow,
and his territory will increase.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.520
I’ll defeat him with the next one!

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.810
Should I make a diversion
with Clone Jutsu…?

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.690
Now his shadow is…

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.190
Okay!

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.270
Clone…

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:37.860
N-No way…!

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.810
My... body is…?!

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.850
At last…
Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:56.440
What?!

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.940
What’s going on…?

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:05.480
That boy…

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.610
How much is he planning ahead…?

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.850
That’s Shikamaru’s skill.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.360
Why…won’t my body move?!

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.230
The shadow shouldn’t
have reached this far.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.110
I'll let you take a look behind you…

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.480
T-This hole…!

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.360
You saw it too, didn’t you…?

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.440
That hole is the hole Naruto
burrowed and flew out of.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.770
So it’s connected to the
big hole in front of you.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.850
I didn’t expect that…
a shadow in a tunnel of a hole…

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.900
Right.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.980
Pure and simple,
a calculated chess move.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.810
So his purpose to make Temari measure
the limit of the shadow several times

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.230
was to lead her to his final trick
of using this hole.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.480
Temari battled on the outside
of the limit of the shadow

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.690
that she measured and followed,

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:32.980
but he caught her from behind,
trailed by the shadow she couldn’t see…

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.690
There is no escape from this.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.810
I-It can’t be…

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.610
The attack that he used
with the jacket,

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.520
was it a device to lead me
to right this spot…?

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.560
Was that an underplot too?!

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.730
Why that--?!

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.850
Checkmate with the next one.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.810
My body is moving on its own!
I can’t resist it!

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.770
Before anyone knew it,
they fell under the spell of this match.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.480
That guy with no mark
is quite a darkhorse.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.900
Yes! You did it!

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.690
Go! Shikamaru!

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.150
Check…

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.560
Good grief… I give up!

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.900
What?!

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.360
See I told you…he’d give up.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.310
Ino doesn’t know anything
about Shikamaru.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.730
W-What did you say?!

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.940
I’ve used too much Chakra from Shadow
Possession Jutsu in rapid succession.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.060
I can’t hold it another 10 seconds.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.190
I thought of the next trick 200 times.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.850
But I’m out of time…

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.230
This has become such a pain.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.980
Doing one match is good…

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.270
That guy is a strange one.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.560
The winner is Temari!

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.650
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.900
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.520

but hates curry

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:46.190
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:53.560
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.400
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.850
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.060
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.480
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:23.770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:31.020
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:37.690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:44.850
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.270
Wow, this is the largest cheer
from the audience ever!

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.730
Of course. The featured battle
of this final tournament is about to begin.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.810
Hate to admit it,
but I'm looking forward to it myself.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.060
Hey, Shikamaru.
I can't hear what you said.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:09.850
There's not a single person who's
not excited about the featured battle.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.860
Next: "Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.850
I can't take my eyes
away from this battle!
