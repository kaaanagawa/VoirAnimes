WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.330
Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara’s Cruel Strength!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.640
That guy...?

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.480
Everyone hide!

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.180
No, lie low quick!

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.550
W-Where is that guy?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.180
Naruto...

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.550
That fool, he finally woke up.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360
You are quite one of a kind.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.560
Actually, you are getting on my nerves.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.710
Sakura!

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.540
– What? 					– Y-Y-Your...!

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.310
Sakura... your hair!

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.550
Oh! This...?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.850
I’m changing my image,
changing my image!

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.720
I like it better long but,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.560
when I move around in
a forest like this,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.460
it gets in the way if it’s long.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.570
By the way...

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.270
why are you guys here?!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.870
Hah... It’s such a pain
to explain it to you.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.610
Everybody helped out.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.610
Huh?

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.620
Sakura’s putting on a show of bravado...

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.550
I’ll take care of him from here.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.020
Ah... Okay...

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.190
Keep it together! Lee!

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.600
Oh? Tenten, why are you here?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.270
I came to help.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.900
Huh...?

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.510
Those guys,
where’s the Sound Village Ninjas?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.110
A kid named Sasuke
drove them away!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
Really…

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.380
Why did you hastily decided
to act on your own?!

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.520
Besides, you really got beaten up!

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.160
S-Sakura was in danger.
So as a man, I...

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.360
You’re kidding...!

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.730
If it were Lee alone,
he wouldn’t have lost to those guys.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
You’re really stupid.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.970
I can’t argue with that.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.470
You, Bushy-Brow!

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.970
Naruto!

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.740
Don’t say rude things to Lee!

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.480
What in the world...

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.250
happened while I was asleep?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.220
That Naruto,
he’s completely out of the loop.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.830
He’s not the type to be
the protagonist of a story, certainly not.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.570
Lee...

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.600
Thank you.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.540
Because of you,
I was able to wake up.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.540
I feel like I’ve gotten a little stronger!

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.550
Sakura...

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.990
It looks like my efforts
weren’t enough!

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.560
Sasuke... Just what you’d expect
from the Uchiha clan.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.690
To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.100
just as I thought,
you possess amazing strength.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.630
I was beaten to a pulp.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.540
What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.970
What’s he talking about?

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.780
Were those guys really that strong?

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.940
Sakura!

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.250
The Lotus of Leaf Village
blooms twice.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.980
Huh?

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.550
When we meet again,
I will have become a stronger man.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.560
I pledge it.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.260
Okay.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.200
Hey Sakura!

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.930
Come here, come here!

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.570
Your hair! I’ll fix it for you!

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.640
That'd be great.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.980
You are really sneaky.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.980
Hugging him like that,
you little billboard brow.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.520
It’s called first come-first served,
Miss Ino-pig.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.400
Sasuke... Uchiha.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.140
At any rate…he’s a strong opponent.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.070
Are you okay, Akamaru?

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.150
Is he still shaking?

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.710
It’s already been half a day.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.020
Akamaru...

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.760
I don’t blame him,
 it’s because he saw that thing...

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.960
After all, brains are most important
in survival!

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.700
Right. Akamaru?

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.300
Lucky for us,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.900
the guys who got caught in
the trap had an earth scroll!

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.010
We’ll be the first to
the tower at this rate!

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.110
Don’t get carried away.
That’s dangerous.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.650
No matter how small a bug it is,
it has to guard itself at all times.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.680
We have to pay attention to avoid
coming across any enemies...

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.820
This is safety.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.850
I know that!

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:28.230
As always, you’re speaking in a way
that’s difficult to understand, bug-nerd.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.130
Um... B-But...
What Shino said...

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.570
He has a point.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.170
I know! C’mon.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.540
Naruto...

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.510
I hope nothing’s happened to him...

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.540
Hey you two, stop.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.220
We’re being careful not to
come across enemy, right?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.150
Then Hinata!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.550
Can you see 1 kilometer
in that direction?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.560
Yep... I’ll have a look.
Byakugan!

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.000
T-There’s someone there.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.940
Evidently there are... 6 people…

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.540
Okay! Let’s go look!

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:19.610
Huh?

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.650
Kiba! What are you saying?
We’re not doing that.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.880
The Proctor told us to bring

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.550
one of each “Heaven” and “Earth”
scroll in a pair.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.560
He didn’t say not to
take more than that.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.560
If we take more, that means
some other teams will be left out.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.560
B-But...

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.930
We’ll just see what’s going on at first..

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.770
If it looks too dangerous,
we won’t battle for no reason.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.140
– Let’s go! 					– Oh!

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.840
He’s an irritating type, that one.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.820
What’s up, Akamaru?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.950
What happened? You stopped suddenly.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.090
Akamaru suddenly got frightened.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.060
W-Why is that?

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.130
Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy’s
Chakra and tell his strength.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.440
But this is the first time I’ve
seen him this scared.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.340
The people going at it up ahead
aren’t ordinary guys...

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.550
Sand Village kids coming
to challenge us forthright.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.550
It’s foolish.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.730
What’s that little guy thinking
to get involved with those guys...?!

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.710
W-What is Akamaru saying...?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.240
He’s saying that big guy is dangerous.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.550
T-They certainly look like bad news...

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.380
They seem really strong.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.560
Hey, kids, you should
pick your opponents...

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.920
You’re all going to die.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.690
That’s enough of you.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.760
Let’s do this quickly...
old chap from Hidden Rain Village.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.800
Which scroll do those guys have...

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.640
Hey Gaara!

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.110
Doesn’t it make sense to
follow them

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.380
and gather information
before hunting them?

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.450
If they have the same type of scroll
there’s no need to fight.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.710
Unnecessary battles are….

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.150
It doesn’t matter.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.990
If their eyes meet with mine...
I’ll kill them all.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.330
That’s why I don’t want
 to be with this guy.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.730
Well, let’s do it. Quickly!

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.840
Die, kid!

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.410
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.540
Hidden Senbons!

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.020
Up down right left,
there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.560
In addition, all the Senbons are
controlled by my Chakra

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.560
and attack on the intended prey!

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.570
Too easy.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.180
Is that all?

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.710
I-It can’t be...?!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.180
Not even one...?

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.850
No wounds...? Ridiculous!

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.550
Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.530
Well, I’ll make it rain blood.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.780
What a giant Chakra.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.680
And, that sand...

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.520
It smells terrible.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.550
Smell?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.560
A strong smell of blood...

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.130
Wall of sand...?

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.560
That’s right.
An absolute defense by sand!

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.570
He manipulates sand inside
a gourd and

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.540
hardens it with magnified Chakra.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.970
It defends the circumference
of Gaara’s body.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.470
It’s a Jutsu that only
he can get away with...

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.540
Furthermore, it’s somehow always
automatically done

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.550
without Gaara’s intentions.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.650
Which means that all attacks
in front of Gaara fade into nothing.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.420
That little...

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.860
You guys can’t defeat our Gaara.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.560
Don’t underestimate me!

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.300
This guy's a goner…

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.800
That’s what you get for rebelling
against Gaara...

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.210
Sand Coffin!

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.680
I can’t move...

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.890
T-This won’t...!

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.970
I can cover your loud mouth
and kill you.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.280
But that’s too pathetic.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.270
Sand Burial!

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.650
There’s no pain.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.560
I knocked him even harder
than was necessary.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.360
The bloody tears of a corpse merge
with vast sinking sand

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.000
and provide more power
to the demon of war.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.500
T-The scroll.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.240
We’ll give it to you!

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.270
Please! Let us go!

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.150
No-o-o-!

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.360
T-This is bad.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.760
Let’s escape quickly!
lf he finds us he’ll kill us!

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.170
Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.270
Okay! Let’s go to the tower.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:28.540
Shut up.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.540
It’s still…not enough for me!

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.510
U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.650
Let’s quit... Gaara.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.460
Are you scared, coward?

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:52.800
Gaara! It’s certainly no problem for you,
but it’s too dangerous for us!

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.400
One set of scrolls is good.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.270
More than this is...

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.410
Lame people don’t give directions to me.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.780
That’s enough!

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.310
How about if you sometimes listen
to what your big brother has to say?!

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.250
I’ve never thought of you as my siblings.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.690
If you get in my way... I’ll kill you.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.460
G-Gaara cut it out! Please.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.000
Don’t say something so cold.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.970
As a favor to your sister... Okay?!

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.430
Gaara!

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.440
Fine.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.590
That’s why I hate brats.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.000
What? So that’s it Akamaru?

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.840
C’mon, you should have
said something sooner.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.210
Nobody’s here...?

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.920
Heh heh! We’re the first?!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.850
No, I sensed someone a little while ago.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.190
More importantly, is Akamaru okay?

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.060
He’s been scared ever since then.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.000
Now that you mention it,
what did Akamaru say before?

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.670
Oh... Akamaru said that it
was dangerous

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.800
because that sand squirt
would kill that big guy.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.540
Sheesh! Just like I thought,
there’s no other place to go!

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.210
They’ve already made us
wait for half a day!

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.540
How much longer do we have to wait?

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.800
Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.470
I don’t know what he is but,
that guy…

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.970
He’s too dangerous.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.550
It’s becoming a real disaster,
but we can’t cancel this test.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.550
What do you mean?

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.990
Excuse me!

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.560
What is it?!
We’re talking about something important!

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.390
Excuse me.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.530
But... Uh...

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
Please take a look at this!

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.230
The video...?

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.270
Ready? Here! Look at the time!

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.550
T-This is…

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.720
It’s a recording inside the tower,

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:36.550
one hour and thirty-seven minutes
after the start of the second test!

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.930
Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Village
broke through the second test.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.130
This can’t be...!

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.570
In a mere ninety-seven minutes...

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.770
This has never happened!

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.470
This is an anomaly.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.110
Those guys are not Genin level.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.550
They’ve rewritten the
fastest time by four hours…

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.650
It’s not just that.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.080
What do you mean?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.560
It’s 10 kilometers
from the test entrances to the tower.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.390
Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,
the rugged forest road...

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.800
As if those were not there…

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.430
Especially the brown-haired kid
right in front…

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.600
What about him?

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.240
You don’t notice?

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.980
I see. This is quite a surprise.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.980
What about him is so...?

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.150
Look closely at his body.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:53.700
I see.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.130
He doesn’t have a single scratch.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.540
What’s worse, there's not
a smudge of dirt on his clothing.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.910
Even I...

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.980
No, any of the other Chunin...

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.550
It’s impossible for us to
make it to this tower without a scratch.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.520
It’s likely that it has something
to do with his ability.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.990
After a long time, a dependable
guy has appeared.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.590
Even though he’s got evil eyes.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.570
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:37.710
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:47.480
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:55.590
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:02.600
Or else I’ll cry

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:06.540
You won't have to search around you

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.170
It’s all ok now.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:19.020
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:24.550
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.930
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.730
Just sing.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:38.230
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.540
The two are one

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:46.780
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.520
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:58.050 --> 00:22:59.260
– Please! 					– No!

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.720
– Just a little bit. 					– No!

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.960
– Really only a little bit.
– No means no!

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.560
I’ll just look a little and put it back.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.160
Remember what the
Proctors said, loser.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.400
When they say don’t look, don’t look,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.540
it just makes me want
to look all the more!

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.540
If you can look when you can,
let’s look!

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.540
Naruto lost it!

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.940
Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.540
Next episode: “The Scroll’s Secret:
No Peeking Allowed”

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.550
I really want to look!
