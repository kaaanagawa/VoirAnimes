WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.220
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.120
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.000
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.170
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.210
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.420
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.750
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.260
Curse Sealing!

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.810
Out of character.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.550
It appears he’s quite tired…

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.520
To think you’ve become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu…

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.390
You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.430
You...

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.710
Long time no see, Kakashi.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.780
Orochimaru…

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.850
Kakashi vs. Orochimaru:
Face to Face!

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.250
Sorry, but…

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.560
I have no business with you, Kakashi.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.860
But I do with the kid behind you.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.770
Why are you after Sasuke…?!

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.510
It’s good for you.
You already got it, right?

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.110
You didn’t have it before, did you…?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.550
That.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.550
That...

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.550
left eye Sharingan!

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.730
I want it, too…

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.560
The Uchiha power.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.110
Come on. Get up.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.560
W-What?!

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.550
B-Bugs?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.320
They burst through the skin…
from inside his body?!

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.220
What a creepy guy!

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.000
Heh! What kind of bluff
are you trying to pull?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.550
These things are called Parasitic Insects.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.720
They attack their pray in groups
and eat Chakra…

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.690
If attacking in this amount…

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.690
you’re finished, no mistake.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.900
If you don’t like that, give up.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560
That would be in your best interests.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.070
If you use your left arm
technique on me,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.910
I’ll simultaneously have the bugs exploit
the opening from behind.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.210
Conversely, if you use
your technique on the bugs,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.940
I’ll simultaneously exploit the opening…

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.150
Either way, you won’t be able
to get through this.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.360
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.600
Hey! Hold it!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.970
You little thief!

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.280
Someone! Grab him!

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.220
Uh-oh.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.220
Man, what a pigheaded kid.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.750
Making us go to trouble!

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.550
You have potential, boy.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.140
I liked your eyes earlier…

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.550
If you come with me,
you can become strong.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.890
Follow me.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.570
If you come with me,
you can become strong.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.970
You can become strong.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.030
Fight for me. If you do that…

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.560
I’ll make you stronger.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.060
Now, please live up to my expectations…

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.540
No longer...

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.070
will I...

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.850
It seems like you’re proud
of your arms. You!

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.590
S-Stop it!

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.060
Stop!

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.960
No longer...

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.440
can I make things
blow up in my face!

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.550
Don’t... underestimate me!

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.470
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?!

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.920
An ace in the hole is something
you set aside, right?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.090
What?! He could already
use his right arm?!

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.170
So the first half of the battle was
a strategic move

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.900
to make us think he couldn’t
use his right arm.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.710
Not bad…Zaku.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.980
What’s your purpose?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:23.890
The recently built Sound Village.
That’s my village, you see…

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.260
You already understand, don’t you…?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.560
Humph! Ridiculous ambition.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.970
Oh, my… you said it.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:44.510
But, for that I need various pieces
who will obey my every whim.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:47.640
Take this!

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.820
So Sasuke is one of those pieces?

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.350
No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.820
And the ones who are taking
the exams now…

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.460
are mere throw-away pieces.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.680
My arms!

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.860
What’s this?!

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.460
Earlier when I recommended
that you give up…

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:39.900
as a precautionary measure,
I gave a suggestion to the bugs…

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:47.540
to block that troublesome wind hole
with their bodies and remain still.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.540
This is what a real ace in the hole is.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.550
Punk!

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.550
Don’t…come any closer... to Sasuke!

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.400
Even if you’re one of
the legendary three Ninja,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.170
at the least,
I can kill you as you kill me!

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.950
What’s funny?

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.590
What you say and what you do,
are all off.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:09.890
What?

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.220
There’s no point at all in
attempting such a seal.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.930
You understand, don’t you?

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.000
The heart to seek out
in pursuit of the goal,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.730
no matter what obstructive power
there may be…

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.000
He is the possessor of that quality.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.310
He’s an avenger…

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.710
So you took advantage of that, eh?

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.610
However, Sasuke is…

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.550
At some point,
he will definitely seek me out…

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.250
in search of power.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.460
Oh, and, you’re going to kill me…?

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.560
Why don’t you try?

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.160
That is, if you can…

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.680
Kill you as you kill me…?!

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.980
Am I an idiot…?

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.540
It seems…it’s over.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.540
The winner! Shino Aburame!

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.090
W-What is he, Neji?!

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:54.520
Byakugan!

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.570
He’s something else…!

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.000
I can understand him calling bugs
with a Summoning Jutsu…

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.340
but he harbors bugs all over his body.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.710
S-Say what?!

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:15.710
He’s of the bug tamer race that
is passed down in the Leaf Village.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.150
Speaking of which,
I’ve heard of it…

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.320
The story of a race that as
they come into this world,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.390
possess the secret technique of loaning
their bodies to bugs

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:29.560
as a nest and fight using these bugs.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.500
They fully control the bugs and
entrust most of the battle to the bugs…

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.900
I hear that they contract to keep
giving the bugs their own Chakra

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.540
as food for compensation.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.520
So he’s…the successor?

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.220
That was unfortunate, Zaku.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.560
Why’d that happen to Zaku’s arms?

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.560
Probably, that guy called
Shino or whatever…

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.730
exploited the opening and
stuck those bugs

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.670
into the exhaust opening in Zaku’s hands.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.540
If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wave
 in that condition,

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.110
the energy with no way out
would expand in search of an exit…

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.050
His arms that are
gun barrels blow up…

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:31.460
and become useless.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:44.000
Our relationship was only that
of having been given the same mission…

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.540
but... I’ll even the score for you.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.380
Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed…

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.710
What?! What?!

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.550
So Shino, you were that strong,
weren’t you?! Dang it!

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.020
I thought he was
a creepy person from long before, but…

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.360
Oh…

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.930
S-Shino, good…work…

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.770
Hey, you did it!

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.000
Yes… I’m counting on you guys, too.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.450
He comes back like he’s
the team leader or something! Dang it!

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.220
Umm, now then, I would like to
get right to the next match.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560
Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.360
Yo!

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.790
Not, “Yo!” Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.300
What about Sasuke? Is he okay?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.930
Well, he’s fine.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.900
He’s sleeping soundly in the infirmary.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.540
However, with Anbu Ops
standing as guards…

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.510
Oh.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.550
Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.550
It’s finally my turn.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.820
Kankuro, he’s totally underestimating this…

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.260
Humph. Idiot…

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.510
It’s him…!

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.090
Unlike Yoroi, I don’t get
careless with kids at all.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.090
I’ll say this first, once I do my technique…

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.560
give up no matter what…

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.570
I’ll bring it to an end swiftly.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.540
If so, I’ll also…

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.540
bring it to an end swiftly!

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.650
Now then, please begin…

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.820
the third battle!

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.100
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:34.470
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:43.980
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:52.360
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.260
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.130
You won't have to search around you

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.670
It’s all ok now.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:15.550
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:21.080
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.560
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.460
Just sing.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.730
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.070
The two are one

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:43.510
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:49.010
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.220
I believed in your words the whole time.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.260
I wanted to be like you.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.560
I thought it would be nice
if that happened.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.130
So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.960
I’m no longer like I was before.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.270
There’s no point if I don’t
exceed the serious you.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.270
