WEBVTT

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
One more time

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you really happy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:54.680
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.510
Sakura!

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.600
It was worth teaching you Genjutsu
in survival training

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.300
during the Genin Exam.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.840
You truly have a talent for it.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.050
Huh?

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.970
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.140
Naruto will be delighted.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.720
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.350
What do you mean by a mission?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.640
Be careful…

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.390
It’s the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.350
Village in Distress:
A New A-Ranked Mission!

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.840
Sensei! What do you mean by A-Ranked
mission in the condition we are in?!

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.510
What do we have to do?!

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.840
Sasuke is chasing Gaara and company
of the Sand Village.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.260
Sakura…

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.840
Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.640
and go after Sasuke.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.970
I feel uneasy…
about that unusual Chakra.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.640
But then,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.850
we should wake up Ino and Choji
and go in a large group.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.260
There may already
be quite a large number

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.840
of Sand and Sound Shinobi
who have infiltrated this village.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.220
Actions lose quickness when there’s more
than the fundamental four in a squad…

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.840
and it becomes difficult to
hide from the enemy.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.890
You learned that in the Academy's
patrol practical training, right?

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.840
Oh, I see! Then four means
that you’ll come with us…

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.720
No, I must not leave here.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.350
Summoning Jutsu!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.840
As for the rest, this Pakkun will
track down Sasuke by scent!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.220
C-Could it be…
the one other member is this puppy?!

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.390
Hey! Little girl!
Don’t you be calling me a cute puppy!

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.850
I didn’t say…cute.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.300
Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsu
on Naruto and Shikamaru!

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.680
Okay!

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.100
Release!

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.720
What is it…Sakura?

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.600
Get down!

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.390
I’ll tell you later!
Just stay down!

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.760
Shikamaru…you were…
from the beginning…

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.390
Owwee!

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.010
You were able to release Genjutsu, too!

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.550
Humph! I don’t want to
end up getting involved!

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.050
Heck no…
I could care less about Sasuke!

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.180
Owwee!

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.470
W-What's going on…?

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840
Naruto! Behind you!

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.840
F-Fast…

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.510
Not just fast…

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.930
Guy Sensei!

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.300
Now, I’ll announce the mission!

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720
As soon as you’ve heard what
the mission is, go through that hole.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.850
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.930
Then await next orders
in a safe place.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.970
Huh? Did something happen
to Sasuke?!

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.010
I’ll tell you the reason en route!

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.840
Let’s go!

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840
Jeez… Why me?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.390
Hey, boy!

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.430
Huh…?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.600
If this mission is a success,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840
as a reward I’ll let you
touch my paw-pads.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.720
So don’t sulk like that!

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.640
Huh?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840
See?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.100
They’re soft and supple!

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.970
Su..pple…?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.840
Yes, very…

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.430
Soft and Supple!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.840
Let’s just go!

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.050
H-Hey!

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.390
Will it be okay with just them?

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.140
They’ll be okay.
Pakkun is with them.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.510
As long as they don’t pursue too far…

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.680
To think I’d be able to fight you again…

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.260
This barrier can’t be broken
unless it’s from the inside.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.140
If Lord Hokage would just
take out one of those four,

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.640
we could help…

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.300
Hey, it’s gonna start soon.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.970
Put up a barrier on the inside, too!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.350
Sure!

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.010
Hm… It doesn’t look like
I’ll be able to get out this easily.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.050
You don’t really mean that.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.600
It’d be tougher for you if someone
came in and got in the way, right?

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.840
Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.840
That’s too easy!

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.140
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.300
With such a weak technique…

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.840
It sucks to get old, eh,
Sarutobi Sensei?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.640
Substitution?!

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.180
Earth Style: Great Mud River!

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.180
Is this it?

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.840
I don’t think so!

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.220
Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.430
Fire Dragon Bomb!

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.550
He’s combined Earth and Fire!

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.550
Excellent, Lord Hokage!

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.220
Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.600
Very good…

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.050
Really, I’ve been grossly underestimated.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.140
Did you think you could kill me
with that level of Jutsu?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.840
Humph… A hateful fellow as usual!

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.140
Don’t say that.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.430
A high maintenance student is cute.
Right, Sarutobi Sensei?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.430
Something’s strange…

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.140
All of the Academy’s classes
doing self-study.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.840
And that smoke…

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.840
That's coming from the direction
of the exam arena.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.840
Isn't there some disturbance
to the east?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.840
I wonder if something happened…

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.840
This is definitely strange!

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.300
But sudden self-study is
sure a smack in the eye!

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.470
It’s been like this for a while!

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.970
Yeah. Iruka Sensei
and everyone are late…

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.260
Aren’t they, Konohamaru?

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.840
Konohamaru?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.430
Yikes!

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.640
Jeez, what is this?!

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.760
And Mom just bought this for me!

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.550
I’ll loan you my colored pencil.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.840
What’re you saying?!
This color is this spring’s new color!

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.390
Aww, what'll I do?

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.840
That is…?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.260
I wonder if Naruto and the others
went to stop Sasuke?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.930
Those brats?

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.680
But surely, some Genin won’t
be able to make any difference…

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.510
Hm? Is this the data of
that kid back there?

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.180
You give him too much credit.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.100
Think again!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.890
You’ll trip up if you underestimate him.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.100
Teachers' Office

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.840
There is information that several units
have already infiltrated the village…!

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.010
We should evacuate the students
to a safe place right away!

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.800
Yes… And without causing panic
among the students!

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.840
Then let’s evacuate the students

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.850
as soon as possible under
the pretense of an evacuation drill!

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.890
Isn’t it about time
we stopped playing around?

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.890
This isn’t an Academy class, so…

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.510
You have a point.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.600
Did you foresee your final moments?

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.840
I won’t go easy on you
just because you’re doddering.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.100
I look forward to it.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.550
Depending on your Jutsu,

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.100
I might have to have you
start over at the Academy!

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.930
Please don’t disappoint me too much!

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.840
W-Wow…

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.840
What Chakra?!

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.930
Yeah… It seems the air is
bearing down within the body!

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.720
Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.840
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.010
That technique!

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.180
One!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.840
He is using a Summoning Jutsu
as a shield.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.140
And this dead person is…

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.220
Two!

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.680
I must stop the third one at any cost…!

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:18.840
Three!

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.140
It looks like the third one was no good.
Oh well…

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.840
It looks like I stopped the third one.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.100
Now, this is where it gets tough…

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.220
He summoned those two of all people…

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.840
I-It can’t be!
Those personages are…!

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.050
Those personages are?

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.220
Now, what will you do,
Sarutobi Sensei…?

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.760
No…

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.760
Lord…Third Hokage.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.350
Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.890
Oh, what a day!

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.390
My favorite colored pencil
didn’t have to break like that!

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.840
Lousy evacuation drill…
Self-study was better.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.100
Konohamaru’s been quiet, hasn’t he?
I wonder what’s wrong?

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.890
Huh? Yeah.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.180
After the whole school does
a long self-study,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.010
the whole school does
an evacuation drill.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:06.140
This is too strange!

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.840
Okay! Stop! Get in line!

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.600
That look on Iruka Sensei’s face…

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.840
Something’s definitely going on here!

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.680
And also…

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.760
Okay, everyone!
Don’t go off on your own.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.300
That rainbow… It's been
bugging me for a while!

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.840
What’s that, Old Man?
There’s a strange rainbow!

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.140
It’s an unusual rainbow!

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.430
Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.680
Yeah! And I’ve never seen
such a pretty rainbow!

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.220
I see, I see.
But, Konohamaru…

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.390
Hmm?

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.850
Rainbows used to symbolize snakes…

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.180
And it’s said that they bode evil.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.050
Such a pretty thing? That’s a lie!

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.100
I see, I see.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.930
Symbolizes snakes…
ls something happening?

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.930
Long time no see…Saru.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:01.550
Oh, it’s you…
You’ve gotten old, Sarutobi.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.720
I never thought I would meet
the great brothers in this manner…

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.260
It’s regretful.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.890
This is bad.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:13.850
That Summoning Jutsu…

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.800
Who in the world are they?!

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.470
Please prepare yourselves…

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.930
Lord First Hokage…

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.930
Lord Second Hokage!

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.350
That’s right…

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.840
The one with the black hair
is the First Hokage.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.050
The one with the white hair
is the Second Hokage.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.890
They are both reputed to
be the highest Shinobi

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.890
and they are the Hokages
who built the today’s Leaf Village!

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.510
Reanimation, huh?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.050
This youth summoned us with
the Forbidden Jutsu, then?

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.970
He’s something else…

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.850
Then, Sarutobi!

00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:00.050
Does this mean we must…fight you?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.430
Let’s stop the old people
get-together talk…

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.470
Shall we get started?

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.890
There’s always fighting…
no matter when you live.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.050
You like that, don’t you?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.970
No good will come by deriding the dead
and playing around with time!

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.840
I get it! So that’s what happened!

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.600
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.760
So, why am I pulled into this?!
This is such a drag!

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.300
It can’t be helped!
lt’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.930
This way!

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.640
That brat, huh…

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.760
Let’s go!

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:27.970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:39.300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:31.640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:42.180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.840
Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:07.260
Once we Genin get caught,
that will be the end.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.840
In that case,
we should ambush and attack them.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.850
I already thought of it,
but it’ll probably be no use.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.140
Then, what should we do?!

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.680
There is only one choice.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.930
Next time, “A Shirker’s Call to Action:
Layabout No More!”

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.180
It isn’t my style,
but we have no choice, I guess.
