WEBVTT

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.720
C'mon!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.660
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.930
Being chased by something

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.340
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.010
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.750
For no single one,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.620
To none does belong,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.490
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.760
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.630
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.030
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.400
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.370
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.840
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.420
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.920
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.630
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.630
Rockin' my heart

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.610
Here we go!

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.280
I'm gonna take care of
my duties with gusto again today!

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.040
Whoa! Mach 5!

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.980
A New Chapter Begins:
The Chunin Exam

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.600
Oh!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.040
Good morning, Sakura!

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.680
Hmph!

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.620
Oh, not again!

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.020
These two...

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.890
They've been sort of strange since
we got back from the Land of Waves…

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.160
Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.630
Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.030
Cha!

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.610
Well...
Good morning, everyone...

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.620
Today I got lost.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.950
Hey!

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.660
Hey, hey...
 Kakashi Sensei!

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.390
Our Group Seven always has
the easy missions lately!

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.000
Aren't there more exciting
missions where I can be more active,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.570
where I can use my Way of the Ninja
and my soul…you know?

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.040
Oh yes yes...

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.210
I basically understand what
you're trying to say.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.480
Shoot!

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.620
He's always making me
indebted to him

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.090
and making himself look good
during our missions!

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.590
I won't lose, no way!

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.960
You little...!

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.830
Today for sure!

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.250
Hmm...
You are so much trouble!

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.050
That's what I'd like to say!

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.790
Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto?
We're going on our mission!

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.220
Okay!

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.290
You've been so annoying for a while!

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.770
I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320
Hey you!

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.080
What?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.290
Oh, Mrs.!

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.620
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.260
What?

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.390
What's wrong?

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.330
Those... those aren't weeds.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.360
Huh?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.540
Those are herbs
I grew in my garden!

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.700
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.160
Somebody…help…!

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.970
No way! Free fall!

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.870
Huh?

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.410
You idiot.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.550
Hey!
69	01:56:47:23	01:56:50:03
TRAP FIELD
		DO NOT ENTER
		 Don't go over there!

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.530
Hey! Please stop!

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.460
That fool...

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.500
Oh no! That's because he
stubbornly chose that big dog.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.240
Hey, hey! Wait a minute,
wait a minute!

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.180
That's the trap field over there…

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.150
Yikes!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.370
Well! It's because you're so reckless!

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.610
Geez, you are so much trouble.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.080
Zazuge--!

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.620
If you act up any more, I'll finish you!

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.130
Mmm…
Teamwork hasn't been good lately.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.200
That's right, that's right!

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.830
Sasuke, you're to blame for
the poor teamwork!

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.970
You're always attracting attention!

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.600
That's you, you idiot.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.340
If you don't want to owe me
big time...

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.180
you just need to become
stronger than me!

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.090
It seems like they're getting
along worse than before...

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.670
Shoot… 					This is frustrating!

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.000
There're plenty of guys outside
who are stronger than I am…

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.440
Always making me go on
this kind of lame mission.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.780
Well then...

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.820
Perhaps we should disperse.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.460
I do need to submit a report
about this mission.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.560
Okay, then I'm going home.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.300
Oh! Hey!

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.470
Sasuke, wait for me!

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.640
Hey, how about...
Why don't you and…

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.610
Why don't we work on improving
our teamwork together?

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.920
You're just like Naruto.
100	01:59:31:10	01:59:35:03
		JUST LIKE NARUTO

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.120
If you have time to spend on me,
why don't you practice a Jutsu!

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.700
To tell you frankly,
your abilities are less than Naruto's!

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.330
LESS THAN NARUTO... CHA!!
		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
		Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.070
That's right…

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.440
It's always that way for me
during every mission.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.210
I'll never be able to really
do anything at all.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:07.280
Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,
and let's practice together!

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.890
Huh?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.190
Sensei disappeared.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.490
Was he being thoughtful?

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.570
Huh?

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.070
Pretending to be…a rock?

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.900
There's no such thing as a perfectly
square rock with perfect holes!

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.970
It's totally obvious!

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.610
Just what you'd expect from
the man I respect!

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.610
You are my rival, aren't you!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.760
Hey! That's too much gunpowder!

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.630
With an adult sexiness!

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.630
I'm Moegi of the senior class
at Kunoichi Preschool!

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.600
I love factoring!

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.840
Udon!

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.770
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!
Konohamaru!

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.280
The three of us together are
the Konohamaru Gang!

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.110
Here we are!

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.080
I knew it was Konohamaru
and friends.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.920
Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.790
We're just copying what
you used to do, bro!

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.430
Oh…

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.130
What's with the oh!

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.230
Your reactions have been
pretty cold these days!

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.300
So, did you want something?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.970
See? Cold.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.740
So, leader!
Do you have some free time now?

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.610
Nah!

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.810
I have to train!

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.620
What?! You said you'd
play Ninja with us today!

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.620
Oh…? Is that right?

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.490
Geez…

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.430
If I played with these guys
they would make me hang out all day.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.630
Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.670
W-What is it?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.510
So, abilities less than this guy, huh?

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.380
You are making me blush
with those stares…

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.150
Naruto, who's she?

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.990
She's been staring at him with eyes
like she's gonna kill him!

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.630
Oh!

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.930
You've been busier
than I thought, bro...

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:09.630
Huh?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.600
Is she your...?

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.610
This?

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.180
Shucks, you guys are
pretty sharp for kids!

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.210
No way!

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.620
Bro!

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.720
What are you doing?!

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.760
No! Leader!

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.200
His pulse, his pulse …!

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.330
You ugly wench! Ugly wench!

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:49.870
Huh?!

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.210
Nooooo!

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.630
Hmph!

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.630
Are you all right, Konohamaru?

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.600
Oweee...

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.780
Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!
ls she a girl for real?

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.290
Yikes!

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.380
That hurt...

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.610
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.750
So, I have formally received
the report from you.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.990
Is Naruto getting along with the others?

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.030
Hmm?

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.760
Well, he's doing okay.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.330
I've been busy lately.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.540
I haven't had a chance to see him
even once since his return.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.740
I'm a little concerned...

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.610
As you know, Iruka Sensei,
Sasuke is also in our squad,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.950
and Naruto sees him as a rival,
which is a little straining.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.890
But, the result is that his abilities
are developing significantly.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.290
Almost to the point that
he might reach yours,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.160
the one he respects!

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.490
I see…

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.180
I wonder what it is?

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.610
Shoot!

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.050
Right now?

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.630
These guys…

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.560
Konohamaru!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.230
That hurt, little punk!

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.800
Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.040
I'm sorry…
I was fooling around…

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.880
What are these two?

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.510
Hey stop!
Let go of that hand!

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.390
Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.720
Let's play with them before
the strict one comes around.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.490
Let go!

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.330
You're pretty lively,
you little punk...

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.170
You jerk!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.220
Wha--?! 					What was that?

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.130
Leaf Village's Genin are
weaker than I thought.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.300
T-These guys are foreign...

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.360
Why are they here?

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.700
Konohamaru…

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.500
Konohamaru!

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.140
Konohamaru!

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.140
It... It hurts …

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.420
Hey! If you don't let go of him,
I won't forgive you! You fool!

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.090
You're the fool!

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.420
What are you gonna do
by getting him worked up!

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.630
You're ticking me off.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.630
I-I don't like little runts anyway.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.000
On top of that,

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.170
you're a smart aleck for
someone younger than me.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.370
Makes me want to break him.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.180
It's not on me.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.050
What's with this guy?
He's crazy…

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:32.220
Well, after this little squirt,
it's the little runt that won't shut up!

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.030
You!

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.630
Huh?

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.610
What do you think you're doing
in someone else's Village, you…

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.610
Sasuke!

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.620
He's pretty cute.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.620
Bro!

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.960
Another little punk to tick me off!

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.630
Get lost!

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.570
Wow! So cool!

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.610
Naruto, you're lame!

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:31.310
S-Stupid! I would've quickly
taken down that thug too!

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.050
Hmph!

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.650
Sasuke, you!

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:39.320
Why're you always,
always meddling like this!

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.630
Hey, come down here,
 you little punk!

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.000
You're the kind of smart aleck
little punk that I despise the most.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.670
Wait! You aren't thinking of
using Crow, are you?!

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.320
Kankuro, stop that.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.380
Huh?

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.430
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.800
G-Gaara...

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.640
When did he get next to me?

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.510
It's stealthy footsteps
on the level of Kakashi...

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.260
There is no other reason to
summon you here other than…

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.620
As I assume you already understand,

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.960
based on the faces
you can see around...

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.630
So it's already that time...

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.600
The other Lands have already
been notified, right?

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:00.840
I've seen them here and there
in the village.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.610
And, when will it be?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.610
In a week...

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.580
That's very sudden.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.620
Now… I will make the
formal announcement.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.990
Seven days from today…

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:26.160
On the first day of July,
the Chunin Exam will begin!

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.200
Yes, yes, yes!

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.870
It's the Chunin Exam,
it's the Chunin Exam!

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.570
If I were to win first place or something,
becoming a Hokage would be closer!

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.700
There's no way I can lose!

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.670
Konohamaru, you think so too, right?

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.070
What?

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.610
Who the heck snatched up Moegi,
and what 're you gonna do?

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.780
Stop, I won't let you get away!

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.550
Next time:
 "Identify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals"

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.620
As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!
