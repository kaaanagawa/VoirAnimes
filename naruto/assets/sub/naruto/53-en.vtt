WEBVTT

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.620
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.560
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.630
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.430
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.600
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.640
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.880
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.920
It will come, closer

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.930
Now

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.370
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.840
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.680
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.080
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.850
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.190
There will be no meaning

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.590
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.020
Hey… Closet pervert.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.930
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu…

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.630
One Thousand Years of Death!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.770
He’s totally knocked out…
He’s weak, sure enough.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
What’s with that big frog?
What the heck are you?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.550
Thank you for asking me!

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.560
Know me as the Mountain Toad…
spirit sage who acquires immortality,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.890
also commonly called the
Toad Mountain Sage.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.930
Long Time No See:
Jiraiya Returns!

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.000
M-Mountain Sage?

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.270
Exactly.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.910
Hey…Pervy Sage,
what’re you going to do about this?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.520
Here, he was supposed to
watch my training.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.920
You did that to him.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.250
He interfered with my research.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.560
Research?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.930
I’m a writer.
I’m writing a novel.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.930
This is it.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.260
Make-Out Paradise

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.910
Oh, that is…!

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.940
You know this?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.310
I’ve gotten quite famous.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.710
That’s not much of a novel!

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.250
In the first place,
what research you are talking about?

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.720
You’re just peeking at the girls’ bath!

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.920
– Yikes! 					– No!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.460
Idiot, idiot…idiot!
My peeking has been found out.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.960
You pervert.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.760
F-Fool! I’m not just a pervert.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.270
I get inspired by peeking
and can write better pieces.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.940
Liar! No excuses.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.040
More importantly, what’re you
going to do about my training?

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.410
You mean the walking-on-water technique
you were doing earlier?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.810
You know it?

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.090
Then take responsibility
and join my training.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.090
Humph. I don’t care about such things.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.330
Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.260
Join my training, hey!

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.000
Shut up! I hate people who
don’t know how to talk properly…

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.300
And I don’t like men.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.040
Oh, umm, umm…

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.310
That Make-Out Paradise was
really exciting, cool and interesting.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.920
The purchase or viewing of that novel is
prohibited for those 18 years or younger…

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920
You liar.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.920
The reviews that I‘ve heard are great.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.190
It’s useless to flatter me.
I’m a sage!

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.800
I’m not the type of fool who can
be coaxed by a fledgling like you.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.030
Oh, hey…wait!

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.870
Farewell, kid.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.210
Wow! He’s cool even
though he’s a pervert.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.390
Heeey, Pervy Sage!

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.930
Where’d he go?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.900
What’re you doing,
you old pervert?

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.550
No, no, I’m sorry, miss…
but what lovely breasts…

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.910
Pervert!

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.890
This grown-up is disgraceful.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.090
Maybe there’s nothing special about him,
after all.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.930
But there’s nobody else.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.930
Good grief…

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.300
As usual, the women in
this village are strong-minded.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.370
However, that’s makes them so good.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.440
“As usual”?
Meaning you’ve come here before?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.340
You.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.940
And you did nothing but peeping, right…?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.410
You Pervy Sage!

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.180
Don’t say pervert, pervert
in such a loud voice.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.750
Shut up!

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.220
So I bet that one shot on
the closet pervert was a fluke…

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.790
Anyway, I’ll have you take responsibility
for ruining my training! Whoa…

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.130
Jeez, you’re a noisy brat.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.930
Hey!

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.270
Be quiet inside here for awhile.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.970
Hey! Let me out, you jerk!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.920
I want to have a romantic encounter
with a stacked girl.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.420
How dare you do that to me earlier!

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.550
Substitution Jutsu.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.960
Sure enough,
he’s not an ordinary old man.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.930
Humph! That punk…

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.340
It’s a million years too soon
for that kid to take me on.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.310
Not really.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.910
It seems you have a bit of talent.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.180
Then you’ll watch my training?

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.920
Give and take!

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.020
I'm not averse to listening
to your favor

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.890
as long as you listen to mine.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.060
So which is it?

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.260
Listen up…

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.970
Nice ripe fruit that looks like this,
like this and this.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.940
I’ll watch your training
if you bring me that.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.170
You really will, right?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.740
This Toad Mountain Sage doesn’t lie.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.740
Okay, wait!

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.960
Plans are plans.
They don't necessarily have to happen…

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.960
Hello there, you ladies!

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.910
Oh my… You’re funny, old man.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.910
No-no, this is the solemn truth.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.250
Yeah, and then,
what happened then?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.750
Hey, Pervy Sage!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.250
Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.560
You fool! Who’s a Pervy Sage?

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.930
I brought the promised item.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.160
Nice ripe fruit..

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.500
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!
That’s not IT!

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.010
Looks good!

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.810
Don't hesitate. Help yourself.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.180
Thanks.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:32.580
No!

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.620
Where’d the ladies go?!

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.930
I got my fill…

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.630
Ladies…

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.930
No doubt about it. That person is…

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.540
Good grief. I’ve wasted time…

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:02.350
Hold it! Where are you going?!
What about my training?!

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.920
I don’t care! My precious research
has been ruined thanks to you.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.720
Research, my butt!
I can’t be standing around here, either!

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.730
I’m going to train hard,
become stronger than anybody,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.560
pass the Chunin exam,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.100
and then I’ll exceed the Hokage!

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.100
Humph! I don’t care about such things.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.310
Here all you do is get in my way…

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.270
Jeez, what a repugnant brat!

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.910
Stacked girls like the ones
from earlier

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.280
are indispensable for
my great writing enterprises!

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.920
I see… So I should bring
some stacked girls, right?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.920
Okay.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.450
W-Wow…!

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.390
If you gaze at me like that…
I feel embarrassed.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.500
Oh…!

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.470
What a…

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.900
What a cute girl.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.900
I like you!

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.910
You pass!

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.940
Idiot.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:44.850
You’re really my type of girl.
What’s that technique called?

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.350
It’s called Sexy Jutsu.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.390
Oooh, what an idea. You’re a genius.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.430
I get the feeling all adults are
really affected by this technique.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.330
Then you’ll watch my training?

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.130
Sure! However, I have a condition.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.540
A condition…? What is it?

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.850
A-Always be…in that form
when you’re in front of me!

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.930
Hey! Sure enough,
you’re just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.930
No! I’m not just a pervert!

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.170
As if you didn’t know!

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.200
I’m a super pervert!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.210
Darn it… He’s gone defiant…

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.050
Well, brushing off the stuff until
now as a joke,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.620
I’ll watch your training.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.920
You mean it, right?

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.420
A sage doesn’t go back on his word.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.390
Okay, kid.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.630
Do that training that you were
doing before one more time.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.430
Okay!

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.600
Okay.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.170
Darn it.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.540
Totally worthless.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.740
Shut up!

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.910
It’s pointless to wear clothes.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.620
Hey, build up your Chakra
one more time.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.250
One more time?

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.790
Just do it, quick.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.160
You!

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.930
What?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.930
You’re pretty sexy when
you’re naked.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.510
Jeez. I’m concentrating,
so don’t interfere.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.810
Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.140
You’re messing with my focus.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.470
I see…So this is The Seal Formula.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.440
Two Tetragram Seals
making a Double Tetragram Seal…

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.510
Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.380
Nine-Tailed Chakra is leaking
from between the Tetragram Seals…

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.580
and is fixed so that it
can return to this kid’s Chakra.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.120
Fourth Hokage…

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.560
It’s to protect this kid, huh?

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.830
But after that, it’s stopped
with a Five-Pronged Seal…

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.170
Putting Odd-Numbered Seal
over Even-Number Seals…

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.600
This kid’s Chakra and that of
the Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.970
and are not stable.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.910
No wonder he is not able to
build up Chakra very well.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.180
That tickles…old man.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.750
Oh, sorry, sorry.

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.220
Perhaps someone else…did it…

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.920
The formula is rough.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.760
Well, it’s probably Orochimaru.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.340
Kid, give me a hurrah.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.200
What?

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.470
Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.180
Jeez, he’s demanding.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.590
Five-Pronged Seal…Release!

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.040
What’re you doing?!

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.910
Well, I just pushed
the pressure points for relaxing.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.920
Just try walking on
the water once more…

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.720
Sheesh!

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.190
What?

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.440
I don’t know why, but it’s going well!

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.910
Yahoo!

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.250
I guess it’s about time to teach him
how to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.380
Okay, kid. Come on out.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.090
I’ll teach you an ace technique.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.920
What, what ace technique?
A deadly technique?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.900
There’s something you need to
understand well

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.910
before I teach you techniques.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.210
You probably haven’t noticed,
but you possess two types of Chakra.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.250
Huh? Two types?

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.920
Until now, have you ever
felt a special Chakra?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.920
Special? Hmm…

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.320
Come to think of it…

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.000
Come to think of it,
I get the feeling there were times when…

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.670
Chakra suddenly sprang up
and an awesome power came out.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.440
But…I don’t really remember those moments.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:16.940
I see.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.340
But I do remember sensing that
it was different

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.850
from the Chakra I always build up.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.910
If I liken it to colors,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.620
while it’s always blue…

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.850
it felt like it was red or something.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.590
I see.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.700
Okay. That’s it for today’s training.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.170
What?! Already?

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.940
What happened to the ace technique?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.910
I can still train.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.380
With training, a watched pot never boils.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.520
As long as we’re here,
let’s have a bath…

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.250
Not just falling in…

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.870
Warms me up.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.910
A drink after training’s the best.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.080
Say, say, Pervy Sage.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.310
What kind of technique is
that ace technique?

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.080
You’ll find out tomorrow.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.920
Miser!

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.760
We’ll turn into boiled frogs if
we stay in here too long.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:18.830
Ebisu, sorry for snatching
your student.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:22.170
It’s okay. More importantly,
I was surprised…

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.900
The Hokage has had us searching
all over for you

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.370
and we could never determine
your whereabouts.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.210
To think you were in this village…

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.510
The Hokage will be pleased.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.850
Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.720
Not yet.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.920
I see. That’s for the best.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.060
Sure enough, something
about Orochimaru?

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.190
No, unfortunately not.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.990
What?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.830
I just stopped by looking
for material for my novel…

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.230
My nature is not to get myself
involved in trouble.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.370
What are you saying?!
You should know!

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.910
What is necessary to stop Orochimaru,
known as one of the Sannin,

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.480
the legendary three Shinobi,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.910
is the power of another Sannin!

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.680
Your power, Master Jiraiya!

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:12.050
First, I need to sign this contract

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.930
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.340
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.910

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.080
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:45.620
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:52.920
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.840
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.040
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.510
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.910
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:22.950
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:30.460
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.930
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:44.170
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.480
First, I need to sign this contract
in blood

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.250
and mark it with the fingerprints
of one hand.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.020
Then I build up my Chakra.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.930
The Hand Signs are
Dog-Boar-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.330
Then I must place my contract hand
on the place where I want to summon it!

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.930
How's that?!

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.810
Next time, "The Summoning Jutsu:
Wisdom of the Toad Sage!"

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.540
What is this?!
