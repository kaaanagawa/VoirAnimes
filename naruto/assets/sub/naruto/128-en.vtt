WEBVTT

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.660
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.870
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.040
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.200
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.750
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.620
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.660
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.910
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.580
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.540
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.750
Sasuke!

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.080
Are you going to
run away from me?!

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.080
Yo…loser.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.490
A Cry on Deaf Ears

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.870
It’s you this time, huh?

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.790
I couldn’t do it.
I was not able to stop Sasuke…

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.830
I think…
the one who can stop Sasuke…

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.490
the one who can save Sasuke is…

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.620
Naruto…you are the only one.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.290
Naruto…this is my…
once in a lifetime…favor to ask…

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.490
Please… Please bring Sasuke back!

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.200
I also told this to Sakura, but…

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.490
Don’t mind me anymore.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.000
What's with that face?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.080
Iruka Sensei, why on the earth
does an outstanding person like me

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.490
have to be on the same team with him?

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.490
Sasuke graduated with
the highest grade out of all students…

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.120
Naruto, you are at the bottom!

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.410
When you even out
the team’s strength,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.910
then it naturally becomes like this.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.160
Try your best not to slow me down,
you dunce.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.660
I am fine without eating!
I am absolutely fine.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.950
I’m…fine…

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:34.910
Here.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.660
You asked Sakura for a hint the other day,
what did she tell you?

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.620
Shall we go?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.330
Yup.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.700
Wh-What’s with that face…?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.490
You loser…

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.620
Why…?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.700
You… I hated you, you know.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.120
It’s none of your business!

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.160
Who knows,
my body moved on its own.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.490
You rescue Sakura, no matter what!

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.830
Sasuke… You…

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.200
I could still distract him for a little while…

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.000
I lost everything once.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:06.040
I don’t want to see my precious comrades
die in front of me anymore.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.500
Why…?

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.290
Why is it…Sasuke?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.950
Why did you become like this?!

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.700
You!

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.450
Whatever happens to me,
what does that have to do with you?

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.120
I have my own way.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.580
No matter who it is,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.540
nobody has the right
to tell me what to do.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.160
I will tell you the truth.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.490
I’m done fooling around with
you guys of the Leaf.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.950
Go home.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.080
I’ll take care of him!

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.490
Choji…

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.910
Go everyone!

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.620
Go, quickly! I’ll catch up with you.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.700
Neji…

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.950
Okay!

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:30.750
Hold on!

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.290
Kiba…

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.870
Kiba! Akamaru!

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.500
Now! Naruto!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.490
Shikamaru…

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.660
The strategy…a success!

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.250
What are you doing?
Please go quickly!

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.660
You also promised Sakura
with a Nice-Guy pose, Naruto.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:00.450
Bushy Brow…

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.620
I’ll defeat this person.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:06.750
It’s a promise.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.490
Everyone…

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.950
Everyone risked their lives
to come after you, you know!

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:21.910
Good job for them.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.290
Lastly, I will tell you
the most important thing.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:46.250
Sasuke is neither a close friend
of mine nor is he someone I like.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.580
But Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves…

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.410
A comrade.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.500
That’s why we will rescue him
by risking our lives.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.120
This is the Leaf way.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.330
How do you take
your comrades of the Leaf ?!

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.000
Comrades, you said…

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.950
Did I become stronger staying
with those so-called comrades?

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.450
I am going to where Orochimaru is.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.160
Orochimaru is the person who killed
the Third Hokage

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.620
and tried to crush The Leaf Village!

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.620
Do you think he will
give you the power freely?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.490
He just wants your body
as a vessel!

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.620
You might not be able to come back.
You might get killed.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.040
You think I’d easily let you
go to such a place?!

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.200
That doesn’t matter to me…

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.250
If my goal is accomplished,
then that’s all that matters.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.290
If you intend to get in that way…

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.910
Then it can’t be helped…

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.290
You’re not gonna be able to!
I’ll take you back even by force!

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.410
Why are you laughing?!

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.950
You were laughing at that time too.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.790
That time…?

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.700
What’s funny?

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.160
It’s not funny. I am happy.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.620
Thinking about…
how I can finally defeat you here.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.620
That time you wanted to fight me, right?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.160
You were thrilled weren’t you?

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.580
At first!

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.950
But, you were different.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:51.870
That was…

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.870
Hurry up and come.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.200
But first, put on your Headband.
I’ll wait.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.490
I don’t need such a thing…

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.490
Just put it on!

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.540
You won’t be able to
put one scratch on my face.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.160
That’s not it!

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:14.910
I’m saying that this is a sign
that we fight as equal Leaf Shinobi.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.040
That is what I call a stuck up!

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.500
You think you and I are equal?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.490
Yeah, I think so.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.330
I’ve never thought I was inferior to you.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.410
You’re so obnoxious!

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.790
Stop!

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.870
That was…

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.450
That was not the kind of fight I wanted.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.500
Even now…this is not…

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.580
I don’t care about
your circumstances.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.950
What…is this power?

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.370
Power is flowing out…

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.080
So this is the power that
the guy was talking about.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.200
Furthermore, the power
is growing into my body.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.490
If it is like that now…
if I release this curse mark…

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.500
I wonder how much power…

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.750
Wh-What power…

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.290
He’s not the same as before…

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.040
Wake up already!

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.290
I awakened long ago…

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.490
From my idiotic self who dreams about
a lax peaceful future…

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.750
hanging out with comrades.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.410
That’s why I left the village!

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.040
That’s why I sought power!

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.490
My dream is not in the future.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.490
My dream is in the past…

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.040
That’s the only place it exists.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.490
Wow, Brother!

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.490
You hit the target right in the middle,
even the one behind the rock!

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.500
All right, me too!

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.370
Sasuke, let’s go home.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.490
Geez… You said that
you would teach me a new shuriken jutsu.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.500
There is an important mission tomorrow
and I need to prepare for that.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.490
Liar…

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.490
Forgive me, Sasuke…
Another time.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.500
Brother, watch me!

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.950
Hey! If you push yourself…

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.490
Why is the one who twisted
his ankle laughing?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.490
Could it be that you are trying
to take the easy way?

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.120
That’s not true...

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.490
I’m happy thinking about

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.200
how I’m finally going to
the Academy starting tomorrow.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.500
I’m going to do my best
when I enter the Academy.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.870
So even that father will approve of me.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.540
He will count on me
like he does on my brother…

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.490
Sasuke… You really are…

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.950
I told you…

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.950
I don’t need a future
with you guys anymore.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.000
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.040
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.160
And you smiled

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.580
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.490
In my own words

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:41.120
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.540
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:52.370
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:58.040
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:04.330
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:11.410
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.490
I feel so sad

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.490
But…

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:17.950
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And you smiled

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.660
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.750
In my own words

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.370
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.490
And you smiled

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.040
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.000
In my own words

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.540
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.700
I feel power surging
through my body…

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.750
It's as though I can't lose.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:01.490
It's power I'd never have gained
playing comrade with you guys from Leaf.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.580
But it's not enough.
lt's way short of enough, Naruto!

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.490
Strength…hatred…and desire!

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.450

 "Brothers: Distance Among the Uchiha"
