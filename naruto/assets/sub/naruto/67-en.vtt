WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.690
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.940
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.230
One more time

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.940
Are you really happy

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.480
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.190
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.890
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.480
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.730
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.890
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.940
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.890
One more time

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.890
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.150
There’s nothing to worry about…

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.100
What?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.520
Sasuke and I…

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.890
We didn’t just get here late
for no reason.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.690
Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!
The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.270
The third eye…

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.770
There is no doubt… That Jutsu is…!

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.730
Darn…Gaara…

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.890
Tora, Saru, Ne, Tatsu, Tori,
lnu, Ne…

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.980
Mi, Inu, Uma, Ushi, Tora, U, Tori…

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.520
Tatsu, Mi, Inu, Ne, Tora, Ushi, Saru…

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.310
Tatsu, Mi, Hitsuji, Saru…

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.900
Tori, Saru, I, Hitsuji, Uma…

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.730
Tatsu, Tora…

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.730
Tora, Saru, Ushi, Hitsuji, Ne, Uma…

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.810
Tora, Ushi, Ne, Tora, Tatsu…

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.890
Tori, Tatsu, Mi…

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.890
Hitsuji, Saru, Tori…

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.810
Tatsu, Tora, Hitsuji, Saru, Tori…

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.520
As I thought, it’s no good.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.980
I, Hitsuji, Uma, Tatsu, Tatsu,
Tatsu, Ushi, Ne…

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.890
Inu, I, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji, Uma…

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.890
Withdrawing like that…

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.600
I don’t know what you’re up to…

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.060
but the timing is perfect.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.890
This thing of mine also takes time!

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.900
Hey, is something the matter?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.850
No…

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.810
It must be my imagination…

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.770
Hurry up!

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.890
Sensei…

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.850
Hm?

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.890
What did you mean when you said
that you didn’t get here late for nothing?

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.440
Hmm…

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.150
You want to know why?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.520
Like I said, this isn’t the time
to be talking about that!

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.560
Shut up and watch him.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.940
‘Cause you’ll get a real surprise.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.980
That idiot…

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.730
Gaara…we never know when
the signal is going to come!

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.060
Yeah…
I’m gonna tear him open.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.890
That’s how it comes out.
What?

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.150
The contents…

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.400
Lots and lots are coming out, right?

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.020
I’ll give it all to you.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.730
I’m always a good boy!

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.480
Yeah, let’s do it.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.890
Mother, I’m watching so…

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.730
Darn! He’s totally useless,
no matter what we do now.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.230
He’s not even
abiding by the plan.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.020
He looks like he’s just going
to screw things up!

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.810
That Gaara!

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.150
Hey, hey, wouldn’t it
be better if we flee…?

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.850
Plan…?

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.520
How’s it going?

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.890
All preparations are proceeding
in accordance with the timeline.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.600
Please hurry up with preparation
for Summoning.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.980
I want to be sure we’re able to
make our move at any time.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.190
Understood!

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.400
All right, I’ll leave that to you.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.060
D-Don’t tell me that…

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.350
The reason I decided to
train Sasuke was…

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:55.940
because he was like me.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.900
A physical Activation?!

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.770
I see…

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.060
That’s why he went through
the physical training

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.890
and increased his speed significantly…!

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.890
That’s right!

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:29.560
Awesome…

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.940
The Chakra is clearly visible
to the naked eye…

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.150
What in the world is happening?!

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.520
Don’t tell me that
he learned that Jutsu…!

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.890
So this is the Uchiha Clan…

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.850
Exactly…

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.890
W-What the heck is that?!

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.480
What a sound!
What’s that technique?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.400
That’s just a jab…

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.770
Huh?!

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.150
However, it is the one used by
Leaf Village’s number one technician.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.900
That’s the only original technique
of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi…

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.650
It’s the special technique used
only for assassinations…

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.770
Its secret is in the speed of the jab,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.770
and also the physical aptitude
that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.150
the ability of the Chakra to
focus solely on the target,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.400
and moreover the speed of
the jab makes a “chichichichichi” sound…

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.900
A unique sound attack similar
to the rumbling of a thousand birds.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.150
And that’s why that technique is called…

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.890
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.890
No way!
That Gaara’s absolute protection is…

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.890
It’s impossible…

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.520
Don’t tell me…

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.940
Excellent work…

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.890
That’s…

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.900
Kakashi’s…

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.150
Chidori…
Also known as Lightning Blade.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.850
Lightning Blade?

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.100
Lightning Blade is another name
for the Jutsu derived

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.730
from Kakashi’s ability to cut through
lightning using that technique.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.560
Huh? Cut through lightning?

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.730
Huh? That sounds fishy…

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.690
A-Awesome…

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.890
The real name of that technique
is Chidori…

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.060
The secret is the speed of his jab
that surpasses any human limitations

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.890
and the intensity of
the Chakra on his arm…

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.520
And that arm turns virtually
into the equivalent of the swing

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.890
of a celebrated sword that
cuts through everything.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.560
But what a reckless technique…

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.730
That’s not for you to say…

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.730
Right, Lee?

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.690
It’s beyond my scope of
comprehension, but…

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.890
What an awesome technique!

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.400
I can understand it…

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.480
If it were me, if I made
a running start at that speed,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.600
I wouldn’t make a direct jab attack
on the opponent…

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.350
Or rather, I couldn’t.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.940
For an opponent,

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.890
a straight line attack just gives him
an easy chance to launch a counterblow.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.690
And moreover, I don’t have the eyes
to read that counterblow.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.400
I envy you…Sasuke!

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.890
When I fought you once, I said…

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.310
Even if one understands visually,

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.850
it’s meaningless unless
one can move physically…

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.350
I was filled with
a feeling of superiority.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.350
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.690
Moreover, you have…

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.890
the Sharingan!

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.600
I caught you!

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.310
Third Squadron.
We are ready any time.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.980
All preparations are complete
on this end too.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.810
Roger. Proceed with action
at the signal.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.690
Looks like it’s almost time.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.770
The guy who was worrying about
Sasuke until just a moment ago…

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.350
is now jealous of him.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.440
Sasuke…

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.890
This is the feeling!

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.940
Summoning Jutsu!

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.890
I’ve gotten stronger…

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.810
In order to become Hokage…

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.560
In order not to lose to anyone…

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.060
Sasuke!

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.400
In order not to lose to you.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.350
I want…to fight you, too.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.890
But you are…

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.480
Yeah…

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.730
What…? This warm thing…?

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.270
Mother…? What is…?

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.560
Blood…my blood is…!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.890
D-Don’t tell me that…

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.100
D-Don’t tell me that
Gaara is hurt?!

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:35.730
What is it?!

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.940
It’s that thing’s arm!

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.690
Darn! Doing something
careless like that…

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.770
Has the Perfect Possession happened?

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.270
I don’t know.
He seems to be injured…

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:00.890
This has never happened before.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.150
It gives me the chills
just to remember…

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.770
When I first saw that thing,
I wasn’t able to eat…

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.230
I mean, visually it’s totally…

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:00.890
What is…

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.150
this sensation?

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.850
He’s hurt, after all…

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.890
The shell was broken when
his body was incomplete!

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.890
It’s different! Those aren’t the eyes!

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.560
W-What was that…
that look earlier on?!

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:45.350
Huh…?

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.940
What’s this…? I can’t see…

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.060
Kakashi! This must be!

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.900
Yeah…a Genjutsu!

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:09.730
– Release! 					– Release!

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.480
What’s going on…?

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.770
Release!

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.650
Genjutsu!
ls Kabuto already moving?

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.190
In that case, it’s just about time…

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:42.310
It’s coming!

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.480
Shall we begin?!

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.890
It’s the signal!

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.560
– Start the operation!
– Start the operation!

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:29.060
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:40.400
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.060
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:01.190
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.520
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:11.770
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:21.890
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:32.730
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:43.270
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.890
Forge on strong

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:06.440
It got dark all of a sudden…
it feels so good.

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.600
I hear something in the distance.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.810
Sakura’s voice, Kakashi Sensei’s voice…

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.440
Scream? I just heard something loud.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.150
I think I do, but… 					Sasuke…

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.770
I got to watch his match!

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.480
But I really don’t know
what’s going on.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.100
Next time: “Zero Hour!
The Destruction of
		the Hidden Leaf Village Begins!”

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.270
What in the world is going on?!
