WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.260
One more time

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
Are you really happy

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.890
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.760
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.930
You shouldn’t lower your guard, Sensei.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.930
I’ll bury you and correct
old mistakes, now!

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.840
Whatever you do now, it’s too late…
I’ve won…

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.220
The Leaf Village will crumble!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.350
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages…

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.840
The Third Hokage!

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.220
Orochimaru! Now I will perform an
ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.220
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.050
Forbidden Secret Technique:
Reaper Death Seal!

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.260
A Jutsu I don’t know…

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.050
Must hurry…
This darkness is dangerous.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.510
I’ll have you show it to me.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.600
What’s the matter?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.890
Are you planning to be killed
slowly by your predecessors?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.970
Please perform that Jutsu, quick.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.430
Not yet…?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.890
It looks like…I was just in time.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.390
What’s the matter?
You’re already stumbling…

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.840
Now all that’s left…
is to catch them!

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.840
I got you!

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.840
I won’t let go!

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.840
Appear!

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.840
The darkness has disappeared…
What’s this Jutsu?

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.510
Sarutobi!

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.840
I’m sorry…Sarutobi…

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.600
We caused you trouble…

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.220
Please forgive me…

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840
Lord First Hokage!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.840
Lord Second Hokage!

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.140
Seal!

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.840
Your own subordinates…!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.840
All members in
the Leaf Village are a part of me.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.300
The villagers believe in me,
and I believe in everyone.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.470
That’s what the Hokage is.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:16.100
Saru… Protect those who love
the village and believe in you.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.390
And bring them up as individuals
to whom you can leave the next era.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.760
As of tomorrow, you are the…

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.930
Hokage!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.930
Toying with even the lives
of your own subordinates…!

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.430
Subordinates’ lives?
Stop the endless nonsense!

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.800
Didn’t these kids believed in you?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.600
Come! Enma!

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:10.100
You’re mine!

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.300
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.550
Dang it! You little--!

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.140
It’s over!

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.840
What is this sensation…?

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.840
This is bad…

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.180
– Die! 					– Die!

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.840
We have to hold them off here somehow.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.010
Isn't our back-up here yet?!

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:22.850
This is out of our hands!

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.760
Ninja Art: Summoning!
Bring Down the House Jutsu!

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.350
This Jutsu…

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.220
Long time no see, Ibiki.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.930
Jeez, is that body
the only thing that grew?!

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.890
I can’t stand to look!

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.850
Master Jiraiya…

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.850
Jiraiya…! One of Sannin,
the three legendary Shinobi?!

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:07.840
Peeps, open up those little eyes
of yours just this once and observe well.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.430
How wonderful!

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.600
The devil region beyond heaven
of Jiraiya, the fantastic sage Ninja…

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.260
will rage!

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.260
Snakes that have been antagonized
by the frog. Begone!

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.350
So that Orochimaru has finally started, eh?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.390
Where’s the Third Hokage?

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.680
The Exam arena.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.640
I see…

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.720
Don’t die…old man.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.640
Why…didn’t you dodge?

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.760
Dang it!

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.010
The Reaper Death Seal…

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.720
In this Sealing Jutsu,

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.970
in exchange for the effectiveness
of Jutsu…

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.180
one’s own soul is handed over
to the Grim Reaper.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.550
It’s a Jutsu that costs your life…

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.640
My Jutsu doesn’t activate…

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.840
There’s no need to dodge.
I will die, anyway.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:32.800
At the same time the Sealing ends,
my soul will also be devoured.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.760
It’s a Jutsu of the hero
who once saved this village.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.010
From now, you will also die…
by this Jutsu!

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.840
So this Jutsu also sealed
that Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:55.680
And now, your soul will be dragged out…
and sealed!

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.220
My body…won’t listen to what I say!

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.390
You’ll probably be able to see it soon.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:13.720
Your soul is also already
about halfway out, so.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.430
Those who have their souls sealed
by this Jutsu

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.720
will suffer inside the belly
of the Grim Reaper for eternity

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.890
and will never attain peace…

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.840
Those who seal and are sealed
have their souls intertwined,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.890
and will hate each other,
and continue to battle for eternity!

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.390
What…?!

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.600
This is… the Grim Reaper?!

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:26.300
Knock it off! You old dotard!
I won’t let you do as you like.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.220
Hurry up and…die!

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.800
Okay, everyone. Line up!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.260
Quiet, everyone!

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.220
Konohamaru!

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.140
Konohamaru, it’s not going
to collapse, is it?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.470
It’ll…it’ll be okay.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:24.300
The structure of this face rock path is old,
but is of strong construction.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.140
My grandpa said so before.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.760
So it’ll definitely be okay.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.260
Someone’s coming!

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.510
Which one…?

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.050
Uchiha, huh?

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.100
Then, what about Temari?

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.640
Don’t run away like that…

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.840
Fine.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.350
I’ll be your opponent this time.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.840
Wait!

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.840
Temari!

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:23.890
I assumed you’d been
creamed by him.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840
So you’re okay?!

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.840
Yeah. Somehow…

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:31.840
But…

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.010
it didn’t turn out to
be much of a delay.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.010
No, it’s time necessary for
Gaara’s recovery.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.050
Besides, it’ll lead to
his consumption of Chakra.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.850
This is…

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.840
Shampoo, again?

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.640
No, it’s Sasuke.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.840
There are several smells near him.
He caught up…

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.390
At last…

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:24.680
Sasuke.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.890
He’s totally stopped moving.

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.350
Is he going to fight with them?!

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.760
Sasuke…

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:36.350
Let’s hurry!

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.260
What’s this clump of countless smells
coming from another direction?

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.300
Hey! There’s something besides us
tracking Sasuke!

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.350
What?!

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.840
An enemy? An ally?!

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.840
I don’t know. But…

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.010
But?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.760
It’s not human.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:01.760
Huh?!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.890
Huh?!

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.760
Go! Kankuro! I’ll take him again…

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.800
Temari, you take Gaara
and go on ahead.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.600
What?

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.140
You’re at your limit…

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.720
I don’t need a hindrance.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.640
But…!

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.840
Go!

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.140
Hurry up and go!

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.600
Okay…

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.350
It can’t be helped…
I’ll be your opponent!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.260
Humph! I don’t care who it is!

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.510
No!

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.840
Your opponent is me!

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.260
You…!

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.220
Shino?

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.640
Why are you here?!

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.850
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.840
The females have almost no smell…

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:31.180
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.840
Though the male itself
has a strong smell…

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.260
Sasuke Uchiha…
You pursue Gaara.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:48.640
Because the battle between you
and him hasn’t been settled yet.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:58.050
I’ll fight him, because originally
I was his opponent…

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.890
I withdraw!
Please go ahead with the match.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.970
Leave this to me here! Go!

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.850
You’re very confident.
But are you going to be okay?

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.220
No need to worry.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:21.970
I’ll go back you up if
I have just ten minutes.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.850
Humph. By then, I’ll be done too.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.840
None of you know anything at all.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.930
You guys probably don’t know
of the real terror of this world.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.140
In that case…
you’ll teach me that terror?

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.840
No…

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.800
If you defeat me and chase Gaara,
you’ll be forced to know.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.050
That is, only if you can defeat me.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:28.050
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:39.390
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:55.050
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.100
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.510
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.760
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:31.720
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:42.260
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.930
You who are strong…
You who are called Uchiha…

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.180
You who have friends…
You who have a purpose…

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.800
You who are like me…

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.550
By killing you, I can truly exist!

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:22.890
Uchiha, you are my prey!

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.990
Next time: “Astonishing Truth!
Gaara’s Identity Emerges!”
