WEBVTT

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
One more time

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you really happy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:54.680
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.970
So what’s up, Temari?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.390
He’s close. He’s just right there.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.220
Dang it! What should we do?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.640
Leave it to me.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.970
That was close.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.430
What was that noise?

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.840
An explosion…
Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.970
I wonder if he’s okay.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.840
Don’t worry…
He wouldn’t get bumped off so easily.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.140
I sure hope so.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.720
Now then, shall we get started?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.850
Before that, I must have you both
return to your original forms.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.840
Please prepare yourself,
Sarutobi Sensei.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.600
An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.430
With every moment,
they are looking more lively…

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.100
What is that…Jutsu?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.260
Reanimation.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.600
It’s a Forbidden Summoning Jutsu
that can bring the dead back to this world.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.470
The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsu
is that it uses the blood of the caster.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.390
But I’ve heard that with this Jutsu,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.550
in order to summon
a dead soul to this world…

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.260
the body of a living person is sacrificed
as a container for the soul.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.220
Then, the bodies of those two
are of the sacrificed…

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.800
Right…

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.430
Perhaps dust and dirt cover
the sacrificial body

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.720
and take on the original form
of the summoned soul.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.550
And by way of the charm
embedded in the head,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.100
the personality of the soul is killed

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.050
and it morphs into no more
than a killing puppet.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.640
They’re complete.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.890
They look like how they used
to look more than ever.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.050
Do you know the joy and sense
of accomplishment

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.350
of hurting one whom
you once called Sensei?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.800
I prepared this scenario
so that you might know that joy.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.390
So please enjoy it.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.350
Lord Hokage!

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.840
Even if the shape and form
are the same…

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.890
they’re neither the First Hokage
nor the Second!

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.260
I…know!

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.140
Here I go!

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.840
Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.760
Water Style: Water Wall.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.260
No way!

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.300
To be able to set into motion that level
of Water Style in a place with no water.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.350
I can’t believe it.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.100
True to the title of the previous Hokage.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.970
Water Style: Water Shock Wave!

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.600
Earth Style: Mud Wall.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.100
Same mighty strength as always.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.350
Having two of you is quite a challenge,
as might be expected…

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.840
This is bad.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.840
This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.930
Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.840
Deep Forest Emergence.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.640
His Chakra became a source for life.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.800
Wow… So this is the legendary
Wood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.600
who brought turbulent times under control
and built the Leaf Village.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.840
You’re finally caught…eh, Sensei.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.430
Okay. Everyone’s here, right?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.140
Okay everyone, let’s evacuate quickly.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.800
Don’t rush and don’t panic!

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.300
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.840
Does your stomach hurt or something?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.180
No…it’s not that.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.220
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.680
Appear!

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.550
Monkey King Enma.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.840
Humph…
Something pesky has appeared, eh?

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.890
Old Monkey Enma.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.840
Orochimaru…
I knew this would happen.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.840
You’re pathetic, Sarutobi…
lt’s because you didn’t kill him back then.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.260
I’m going to do it now!

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.100
It’s too late.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.180
Please…Enma!
The Adamantine Nyoi.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.840
Take care of him.
Don’t let him transform into that!

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.180
Okay… Got it!

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:27.840
Transform!

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:35.970
All right.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.680
Wow… What level of Ninjutsu battle!

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.100
This is Hokage level!

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.140
Oh well…
Things have finally gotten interesting.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.840
That's one of his Snake Swords.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.100
Let’s do it, Enma!

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.300
No matter how strong the body,
the Snake Sword still hurts.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.300
You’re mine!

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:29.970
Lord Hokage!

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.720
So foolish…

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:38.390
To think you’d strike without even
using the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.840
No, that’s not it.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.640
It's not that he didn't use it.
He can’t use it.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.180
The amount of Chakra the Third Hokage
has differs from the past.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.260
The Shadow Clone Jutsu that
evenly disperses Chakra,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.840
if things go wrong,
would be like throwing away Chakra.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.850
Sure enough, is it age?!

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.470
Are you okay, Sensei?

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.930
Please hang in there.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.680
You are called…

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.470
“the Professor who knows and uses all
of the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village,” right?

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.140
Please don’t disappoint me too much.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.840
Please get up, Lord Hokage…!

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.720
And please save the Leaf Village!

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.350
Lord Hokage!

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.260
Fool… It is too late.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.840
Sarutobi, what’s wrong?

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.180
You’re not your usual self.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.100
It’s as if you’re good for nothing…
What are you hesitating for?

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.680
Now’s the time to draw the line.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.100
Orochimaru…

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.840
You…fool!

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.840
Orochimaru…

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.430
This is the end.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.510
I’ll snap your neck.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:48.680
As I thought…

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.300
It looks like there’s no point if
I don’t do something about the soul itself

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.800
that is bound by the Reanimation.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.840
If so, all I can do is to use…
the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.350
Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,
please forgive me for using that Jutsu!

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.430
Sensei…it seems you’re out of breath.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.840
You’ve gotten old, haven’t you?

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.180
I’ve never seen such a pained look.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.800
What’s so funny?

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.840
It’s quite sad…

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:44.510
Old age beats even you,
once renowned as the god of Shinobi.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.010
What’s that…?!
What the heck is going on?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.390
Who the heck is that youth?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.680
Who the heck are you?!

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.050
Is it so sudden you can’t tell?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.550
It’s me. Orochimaru.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.890
It can’t be…

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.260
Have you completed that
Forbidden Jutsu?!

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.350
You’re a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.840
I finally caught up.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.840
This is as far as you guys go.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.100
Dang it!

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.840
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.140
I won’t let you get away now.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:27.970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:39.300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:31.640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:42.180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.890
Orochimaru…

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.390
a genius Ninja who appeared
during the war-torn era

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.390
and one of a kind in decades.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:13.180
I wanted to believe that this individual
would succeed my strength and will.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.680
But my naiveté created this situation.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:22.840
I will bury you now and
correct my old mistake.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.890
Next time, “A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!”
