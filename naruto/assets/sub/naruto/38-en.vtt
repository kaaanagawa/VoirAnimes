WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.320
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.220
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.300
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.100
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.310
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.550
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.590
It will come, closer

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.070
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.510
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.340
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.520
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.850
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.260
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.020
It’s a custom where balance is preserved
by fighting and removing life.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.860
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.560
This is a fight for life with the pride
of the village and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.200
one’s own dream on the line.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.730
Heh, I’m convinced.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.670
Anything is fine.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.270
Just tell us the content
of that fight-for-life test.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.110
Very well.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.710
Now then, this is where I’d
like to explain the third exam.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.180
But actually…

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.660
Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who was
given the task of judge, to speak first.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.390
I leave it to you…

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.500
There’s something... I’d like you all
to do...

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.500
before the third exam.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.010
And that is a preliminary
to the third exam,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.710
with participation in
the main battle on the line.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.050
Preliminary?

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.150
What do you mean…preliminary?!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.860
Sensei, I don’t understand
the point of that preliminary.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.730
Why aren’t we doing the next exam
with the remaining test-takers?

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.560
This time around,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.600
perhaps because the first and
second exams were easy,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.600
there are a few too many
people left, you see.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.270
In accordance with the rules
of the Chunin Exams,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.010
a preliminary will be held in order to
reduce the number advancing.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.550
N-No way!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.350
As Lord Hokage said before,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.720
many guests will be coming
 to the third exam.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.230
So we can’t have long pointless matches
and our time is limited as well.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.630
Therefore, those of you
not in top physical condition…

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.800
Hey, is he okay…?!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.510
The teacher doesn’t look well himself?!

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.680
Excuse me.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.550
Those of you who wish to drop out,
please speak up now.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.720
The preliminary will
begin immediately, so…

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.650
Immediately, you say…?!

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.920
But we finally made it through
 the second exam.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.090
This is a pain…

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.560
Huh? What about our meal?

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.600
Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.210
Okay!

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.540
I’m going to do my best, no matter what!

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.980
I promised Kabuto, too…

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.550
And oh...

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.820
I forgot to mention this, but it will
be individual battles from now on.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.560
It is your decision, so feel free
to raise your hands and drop out.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.390
Who’s going to quit?!

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.100
Sasuke?!

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.340
The waves of pain are
coming faster...

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.540
Sasuke… I knew it.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.810
Sasuke, you should quit
these preliminaries!

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.550
Huh?!

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.380
L-Look, you haven't been yourself

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.080
ever since you got worked
over by that Orochimaru guy!

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.460
That bruise hurts even now, right…?

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.560
Bruise…?

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.560
At this rate…!

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.900
I gave him a parting gift.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.140
Sasuke will definitely seek me…
in search of power.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.330
You’re the only one left.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.730
Please…

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.900
Please, quit!

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.640
I’m…scared.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.180
Sakura…

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.880
I knew it.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.120
What shall we do?

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.550
We should remove him
from the exams

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.750
and isolate him with
Anbu bodyguards on him.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.090
We should recommend that
he retire immediately.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.860
He’s not the kind of type to
 just obey like that…?!

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.230
After all, he’s of the Uchiha clan.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.400
What’re you talking nonsense for?!

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.340
I’ll make him stop, by force if needed!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.440
The Curse Mark responds even
when one’s just building up Chakra

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.610
and attempts to forcibly
extract his strength!

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.550
It’s a prohibited Jutsu that eats
into the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.820
It’s a wonder that kid is even enduring it.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.050
He should really already be dead!

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.890
Lord Hokage!

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.260
You’re in no condition to
fight properly, Sasuke…!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.560
Shut up.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500
I understand!

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.530
Be quiet!

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.470
But you’ve been enduring the pain
this whole time, right?!

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.140
Please be quiet!

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.680
No matter what you say, Sasuke...

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.680
I’m going to tell the teachers
about the bruise!

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:16.910
If I do that...

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.420
Well…

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.750
Oh…?!

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.390
What…?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.000
Excuse me…I’ll quit.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.930
K-Kabuto…?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.840
Let's see...

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.940
Kabuto Yakushi of
the Leaf Village, correct?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.550
Then, you may step back.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:51.220
Okay.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.550
Kabuto!

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.690
Why’re you quitting?!

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.390
Tell me! Why?!

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.590
This guy…

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.700
I’m sorry, Naruto…

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.600
But my body is worn out.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.540
Actually before the first exam...

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.510
when I wrangled with
the guys from Sound Village,

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.510
I’ve had no hearing at all in my left ear.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.050
To fight right away…

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.480
and to be told that my life would
also be on the line, I can’t go on.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.560
I’ve seen that face a few times.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.100
As I recall, I think he dropped out
of the main battle before, as well.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.170
What in the world is he thinking?

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.440
Anko.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.910
Uh…yes.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.710
Kabuto Yakushi.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.750
According to the data,
he has failed six straight times.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.250
What about his background?

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.550
From his time at the Academy,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.560
he was a student who did
not really stand out,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.960
and his grades were ordinary.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.230
He finally passed the graduation
 exam on his third try.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.800
After that, as for the missions
he carried out,

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.100
two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.440
It’s not a battle record to
write home about.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.470
However…

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.540
However…?

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.510
It’s about before the Academy.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.550
Hmm?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.810
Do you remember the story...

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.390
about the one boy brought back
from the Kikyo Pass battle?

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.020
I remember.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.560
As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivor
at the battlefield

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.430
was taken back by a Jonin from
the medical unit.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.130
So he’s that boy…?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.800
Don’t take arbitrary actions.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.810
Have you forgotten
Orochimaru’s orders?

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.680
I leave it to you guys.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.710
You in particular, Yoroi.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.320
There should be no problems
here with your ability.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.090
This is where you can
show your strength.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:15.390
Those of you who are irritated that
I’m ahead of you.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.800
So you’re Orochimaru’s favorite, huh?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.270
Don’t get all high and mighty, kid.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.930
I understand, Yoroi sir.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.310
Oh.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.550
Naruto… Sasuke…

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.180
I wanted to play with you guys
a little more.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:41.550
But if I do more than this…

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.520
The old me might get stirred up.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.090
I am a spy so far as it goes.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.260
I cannot expose myself, here.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.570
Also…if you are going to watch.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.100
My role of information collecting
has served its purpose…

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.540
Master Orochimaru.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.850
I’ll save the fun, for some other time…

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.250
Sasuke…

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.550
And Naruto...

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.550
You too.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.940
Now then, there are no others
who will quit?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.780
I must tell the teachers,
about Sasuke’s bruise!

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.820
Huh?!

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.650
Be quiet about this bruise.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.130
Why’re you acting tough like that?!

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.570
I don’t want to watch you suffer
all the time anymore!

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.600
For me you are…!

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.540
This has nothing to do with you!

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.370
It’s none of your business.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.880
I said it once before…

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.050
I’m an avenger.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.730
This is not just a mere exam to me.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.730
The Chunin business has
nothing to do with me.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.110
“Am I strong?”
All I want is the answer to that.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.870
By fighting with those who are strong!

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.440
And…

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.480
I’m Gaara of the desert.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.750
Hey, you there…
ldentify yourself.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.550
I declare.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.550
You are absolutely no match for me.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.690
If I have the opportunity to fight you
in the next exam,

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.600
we won’t run or hide.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.530
And they’re... here!

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.980
I will not allow even you
to take my path away from me!

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.710
Sasuke…

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.680
You!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.480
What’re you doing putting up
a front, you idiot?!

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.150
Here Sakura is this worried about you--!

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:30.150
Naruto!

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.930
I want to fight you, too.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.060
Huh?!

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.400
What Orochimaru said
is sitting on my mind.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.940
I will let Sasuke do the test...

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.380
– and see how things go.
– Wha--?!

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.110
L-Lord Hokage…!

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.850
However, if the Curse Mark opens

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.550
and the power gets even a little bit
out of control,

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.880
get in there and stop it.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.750
All right.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:02.990
But...!

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.660
I understand.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.100
Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.270
The preliminaries to come
will be one-on-one individual battles.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.710
In other words,
actual battle format.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.980
There are now exactly twenty people,
so we will conduct ten battles.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.720
The winners will be able to
advance to the third exam.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.220
There are no rules at all.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:46.230
You will fight until someone dies,
 collapses…or admits defeat.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.570
And... please admit defeat right away
 if you don’t want to die.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:56.770
However, in case I judge
that a match is over…

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.550
err... I don’t want to needlessly increase
dead bodies,

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.850
so I will intervene and stop the match
or something to that effect.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.390
What holds the key to your destinies is…

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.720
Open it.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.900
This.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.110
The names of two foes will be
randomly selected and

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.640
displayed on this electronic signboard.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.710
Now then, let’s get right down to it

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.480
and announce the two names
for the first battle.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:53.230
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.900
To think it’d be so soon…?!

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.640
I couldn’t ask for more.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.210
No way…!

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.880
Why Sasuke?!

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.150
Now then, the two displayed on
the signboard, come forward.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.900
For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado and
Sasuke Uchiha have been selected.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.470
No objections, right?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.300
– Right. 					– No!

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.520
All I can do now is watch…

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:49.990
Sasuke…

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.690
Sasuke!

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.760
If you want to fight me, don’t lose!

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.130
Sasuke… You’re acting strange…

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.770
Is it because of the Curse Mark…?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.000
Sasuke, do your best!

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.140
I guess I’ll wait and see…

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.210
The pain won’t go away!

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.250
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.050
Now then, we will begin the first battle.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:31.190
Everyone other than the two foes,
please move to the upper area.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.470
Hey! Kakashi Sensei!

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.310
Sasuke!

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.510
Huh?

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.920
Don’t use the Sharingan.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.550
So you knew?

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.820
If that Curse Mark on your neck
gets out of control,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.320
it could endanger your life.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.230
I believe it.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.470
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.540
I’ll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.200
Called off, you say?!

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.550
It seems this Curse Mark thing
 is responding to my Chakra.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.860
This is my final Chakra…

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560
Sharingan!

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.630
Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:45.570
If I carelessly build up Chakra,

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.540
it would extract my spirit energy,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.510
and bring out the Chakra
inside my body to no end.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.180
In other words, in this match,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.250
I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,
not to mention the Sharingan!

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:10.990
However... Yoroi’s ability is
 the worst for you, Sasuke.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.940
Now then… How will I go…?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.580
Don’t act rashly…Sasuke.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.160
Now then, please begin.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.220
Let’s go!

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.730
Yeah!

00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.710
Oh no!

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.560
He did it!

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.270
My strength…?!

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.050
W-What is this?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.220
My body strength has suddenly…!

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.990
Sasuke!

00:20:58.900 --> 00:20:59.600
Sasuke…!

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.540
You…my Chakra…

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.540
You just noticed now…?

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:23.760
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:32.000
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:41.540
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:49.890
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:56.830
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.700
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.470
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:13.310
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.550
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:23.220
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.020
Just sing.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.500
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.600
The two are one

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:41.070
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.580
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.380
Dang it!
The pain won't go away!

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.850
This darned Curse Mark is
responding all the time!

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.520
But I won't let this
exam get called off!

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.090
How will I do?
How should I fight?

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.200
Am I strong?

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.260
All I want is the answer to that.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.840
I won't let this thing swallow me up
in a place like this!

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.440
