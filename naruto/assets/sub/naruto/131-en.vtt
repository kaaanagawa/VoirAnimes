00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.720
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.470
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.590
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.600
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.010
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.470
All the kids said

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.350
All the kids said

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.180
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800
All the kids said

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.100
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.430
All the kids took off

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.850
into this windless night

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.390
Because they want to change something

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.010
The Secrets of the Mangekyo Sharingan

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.050
No matter what darkness
might lie ahead,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.970
I will rush into it headfirst!

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.100
No matter what happens,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.430
I will get my hands
on that power!

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.590
It’s getting late…

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.220
What was that?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.590
I thought I sensed
someone there just now…

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.050
The lights…

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.970
It isn’t even close
to bedtime yet…

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.800
This is…!

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.350
Wh-What is this…?!

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.590
What the hell is this?!

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.590
Uncle… Aunt…

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.350
Father… Mother…

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.590
Father? Mother?

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.600
There’s somebody in there!

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.590
Move!

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.590
Move!

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.010
Move!

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.140
Father! Mother!

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.140
Big Brother!

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.890
Big Brother!
Father and Mother are…!

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.510
Why? For what reason?!

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.890
Who the hell would do
something like this…?!

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.140
Big Brother…what are…?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.590
What are you doing, Big Brother?!

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.300
You pathetic younger brother…

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.510
Mangekyo Sharingan!

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.590
Stop! Big Brother!

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.590
Don’t make me see
this kind of thing!

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.350
Why…?!

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.010
Big Brother, why did you…?!

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.550
Why…

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.510
Big Brother… Why did you…?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.220
In order to measure my vessel…

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.100
To measure your vessel?

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.260
Is that all?

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.350
Only for that reason…
you killed everybody…?

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.590
That is what is important.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.930
What the hell is that?

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.590
You gotta be kidding!

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.100
I’m scared…

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.010
I’m scared!

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.300
Don’t kill me…!

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.550
I don’t believe it!

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.760
This is too unlike you, Big Brother.
I mean…

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.430
The reason I acted as the big brother
you desired was…

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.100
because I wanted to
measure your vessel.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:12.350
You have the potential
to become my opponent

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.390
in order for me to measure
my vessel.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.680
You hated me…

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.600
and you continued to have
the desire to surpass me.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.930
That’s exactly why
I will allow you to live…

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.640
for my own benefit.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.890
You are someone who could be able to use
Mangekyo Sharingan just like me.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.590
However, on one condition…

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:51.470
That you must kill
your closest friend…

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.760
Y-You’ve gotta be kidding…

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.590
Just like I did…

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.590
Regarding Shisui Uchiha
who committed suicide last night

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.300
by throwing himself into
the Nakano River…

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.100
The other one that did not show up
to the meeting is Shisui…

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.590
If I remember correctly…

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.300
you adored him like
he was your real older brother…

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.140
That was…your doing…?

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.430
Big Brother, you…killed Shisui?!

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.100
That’s right…and because of
that I obtained these eyes.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.760
The main hall of Nakano Shrine…

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.550
Underneath the seventh tatami mat
on the far right

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.970
is the secret gathering place
of the Clan.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.430
There you will find recorded
the secret of…

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:58.220
the raison d'être of
the Uchiha Clan’s Visual Jutsu.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.850
The secret of the raison d'être…?

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.760
If you attain these eyes,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.600
you will become the third person
including myself

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.970
to utilize
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.510
If that happens…

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.760
then there will have been meaning
in my allowing you to live.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.590
However…at present…

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.010
You are not worth killing.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.890
My pathetic younger brother…

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.760
If you want to kill me,
then begrudge me!

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.350
Hate me!

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.010
And live in an ugly manner…

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.590
Run away…run away…
and cling to life…

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.100
And one day, when you have
the same eyes as I do…

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.590
come and stand before me!

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.350
A dream…?

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.180
Yes…that’s right.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.140
The only one who survived…
is that boy.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.600
Didn't he have
an older brother?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.590
Yes, but he’s gone missing…

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.430
It can’t be true…
That elite Uchiha Clan…

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.640
Hi, Sasuke! What did you
come to buy today?

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.590
Sasuke, are you on your way to school?

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.680
Yeah.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.430
I saw Itachi earlier,
but he’s very admirable, isn’t he?

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.760
He’s already become
a top-class Shinobi.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.590
He graduated from the Ninja Academy
at the top of his class at age seven

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.590
and attained the rank
of Chunin at age ten, didn’t he?

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.800
He was able to use Sharingan
when he was eight!

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.760
That’s true, isn’t it?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.220
That boy is truly the pride
of the Uchiha Clan.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.850
Welcome home…Sasuke!

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.050
Sasuke…!

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.680
Wait a second…

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.720
What is it?

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.590
Mother?!

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.590
Then why only Big Brother!

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.010
Your brother's your brother.
And you are you.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.550
Father cares deeply
about both of you.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.720
The main hall of Nakano Shrine…

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.720
Located underneath
the seventh tatami mat on the far right

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.590
is our clan’s secret gathering place…

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.100
I see… So that’s what it is…

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.470
Ninja Academy

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.930
Hey, Shikamaru…

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.050
Wanna go to the candy shop
after school?

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.590
Huh… No way.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.140
You can do that ‘cuz
your mother’s nice,

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.590
but if my mother found out that I bought
myself a snack before going home,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.260
I’d be in big trouble.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.140
Did you hear the news…

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.300
that entire Uchiha Clan
was apparently murdered?

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.430
Yeah, my dad told me.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.970
Apparently he’s the only one
who survived…

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.430
That’s my boy.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.050
With me, you’re all
your father talks about…

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:38.100
I wonder…what kind of things
Father was saying to Mother…

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.510
If you want to kill me…

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.600
Begrudge me! Hate me!

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.220
If it’s for the purpose of killing you,

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.050
I will rush headfirst into whatever
darkness which may lie ahead!

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.390
I will obtain that power no matter what!

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.930
From this point onwards,
I am an avenger!

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.510
Sasuke is now
in depths of darkness…

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.390
If you stop in a place like this…

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.760
you won’t be able to catch up
with Sasuke.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.430
Neji, it’s just like you said.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.550
That guy looks like he’s in
the depths of darkness right now…

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.350
He really hit me with
his full strength! Damn it!

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:10.010
Don’t you consider me…
your comrade any longer?!

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:16.590
Don’t all those things we did together
in Squad Seven mean anything to you?!

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.050
No.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.590
I will get my hands on
that power no matter what.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.850
It wasn’t meaningless…

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:35.390
To me, you became my…
closest friend.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.470
We've become…friends?

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.800
Then…why?!

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.640
All the more reason why…

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.720
All the more reason why…

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.300
there’s meaning in taking
you down.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.050
I don’t fully understand but…

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.590
I understood that you want to
fight me with your everything!

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.590
Sasuke…!

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.590
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:34.850
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:45.550
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:55.260
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:02.010
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:11.390
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:23.010
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:33.550
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:46.220
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.550
Are you trying to take me
down for real?

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.300
I don’t know any longer

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.140
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not!

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.930
Could it be that it was only I
who thought we were friends?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.590
If that’s the case,
I’m just a really lame guy…

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.590
Aren’t I? Sasuke?

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.220
Next episode: “For a Friend”
