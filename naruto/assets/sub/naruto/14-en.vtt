WEBVTT

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.760
C'mon!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.700
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.970
Being chased by something

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.370
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.040
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780
For no single one,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.650
To none does belong,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.520
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.660
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.070
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.440
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.870
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.450
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.950
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.660
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.660
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.670
Rockin' my heart

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.320
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.660
This is a Hidden Village that has produced
many superb Ninjas.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.660
– Hey Naruto! Why did you do such a thing?!
– You're really gonna get it this time!

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
The number one prankster of the village,
Naruto Uzumaki,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.500
is a boy who is also
striving to become a first-rate Ninja.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.670
I don't care!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.100
Transform!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.780
His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.710
–You fool!
– However, Naruto had a secret inside him.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.610
– Stop making idiotic spells!
– that even he didn't know about.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.020
At one time, the nine-tailed fox drove
the Village Hidden in the Leaves

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.650
to the brink of destruction…

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.660
That nine-tailed monster fox is
sealed within Naruto's body.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.640
– Look at that one.
 – Therefore, he's been abhorred

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.070
– I hear he's the only one who failed.
– as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.810
Serves him right.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.610
Imagine what would happen
if he becomes a Ninja.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.810
Okay, you may open your eyes now.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.750
Congratulations on your graduation.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.960
However, that Naruto,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.020
– Iruka Sensei!
– on my sufferance,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.460
– That hurts!
– graduates from the Ninja Academy.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.200
Say cheese!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.670
He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.440
Ninja missions are conducted
by three-man cells.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.080
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.650
A descendant of the Uchiha clan,

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.920
a distinguished family in
Hidden Leaf Village.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.650
He is a boy towards whom Naruto harbors
intense feelings of rivalry.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.660
Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi who
Naruto has the hots for.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.170
As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missions
with these two rookie Ninjas.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.170
The one who observes and
instructs them,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.640
Kakashi Hatake,
also known as the Copy Ninja,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.480
is the Leaf Village's most skilled Ninja.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.920
One day, Naruto's group takes on
the mission to guard Tazuna,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.620
a master bridge-builder
of the Land of Waves.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.560
All right! We're off!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.990
However, Tazuna is targeted by a man
named Gato

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.660
who attempts to control
the Land of the Waves.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.830
Stop your darned grumbling…!!

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.710
– Next time I'll kill him with...
– And Gato had hired a terrifying man

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.480
– head chopper!
– for Tazuna's assassination.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.710
Zabuza Momochi…

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.650
A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hidden
in the Mist.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.650
He was a man who had excelled at
Silent Killing and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.850
had successfully carried out
many assassinations.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.670
Naruto and the gang have
a tough time of it

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.470
in the face of Zabuza's attacks…

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.610
Hey! You, with no brows…

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.950
Record in your Bingo Book
about the man

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.480
who'll one day become
the Leaf Village's Hokage.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.020
Naruto Uzumaki!!

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.060
It's not so easy!

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.000
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow…!

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.340
However, the shoe is on the other foot,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.640
thanks to Naruto and Sasuke's
close team work.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.780
Kakashi copies
Zabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.420
– W-What's that?!
– It breaks Zabuza's composure.
78	01:05:42:24	01:05:44:29
Me...?

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.020
R-Ridiculous!

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.830
Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.530
The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.900
No way!

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.030
It's over…

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.670
A Tracker Ninja boy
from A Hidden Mist Village

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.810
is the one who delivered
the final blow.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.320
I must get rid this corpse
because it contains many secrets.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.450
Now then, please excuse me.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.430
However, this boy, Haku...

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.530
was Zabuza's comrade.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.200
Will you be all right the next time?

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.630
The next time…

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.640
I'll be able to see right
through the Sharingan.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.440
Kakashi who has inferred
that Zabuza is still alive,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.740
gives Naruto and gang…

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.810
– Ready!!
– new training in preparation...
96	01:07:15:05	01:07:17:23
– Here I go!
		– for Zabuza's second assault.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.030
And then, 					One week later...

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.660
This mist…

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.570
Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.510
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.710
So it seems.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.650
The time has come!

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.650
Secret Jutsu…

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.090
Crystal Ice Mirrors!

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.230
Now then… I'll start.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.900
Take this!

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.630
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.640
is finally here!!

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.640
The Number One Hyperactive,
Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.990
Now that I've come, you're all right!

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.990
Oh…

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.130
Naruto!

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.160
The hero of a story generally appears
in this kind of situation

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.400
and takes out the enemy in no time!

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.040
Heh… That brat, eh…

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.110
He's long on talk...

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.640
Man, that idiot!

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.040
Making such a conspicuous entrance…

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.050
There's no point if you don't
catch the enemy off guard!

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.920
That boy…

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.660
What're you doing in a place
like this from morning?

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.300
Training!!

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.500
Why are you training?

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.500
I want to get stronger!

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.910
All right, here I go!
Shadow Clone Jutsu…

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.310
Huh?!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.850
Oh, no!

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.050
Huh?

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.650
Get out of the way, Naruto!

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.520
Whoa!

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.620
What?!

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.790
He's saved…

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.660
To think the enemy attacks
would cancel each other out…

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.870
That was super lucky…

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.370
Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.870
Hey! What kind of idiot
would attempt

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.570
to cast a Jutsu directly
in front of an opponent?!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.740
What?!

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:34.410
The essence of a Ninja is deception.
How you deceive your opponent.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.520
Even casting one Jutsu,
you avoid the eyes of your opponents,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.650
catch them off balance,
and outsmart them…

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:46.660
The way you made your entrance earlier,
that's just you coming to be a target…

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.930
N-Nooo.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.400
But I went to the trouble
of coming to the rescue.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.330
What concerns me more than that is…

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.640
That guy…

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.540
Haku… What's the idea?

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.150
Zabuza, leave this kid to me…

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.080
Please let me fight this battle my way.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.820
What did you say…?

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.260
So you mean no interfering…Haku?

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.800
You're naive…as usual…

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.700
I'm sorry…

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.000
Naive, eh…

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.870
True enough…

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.540
Judging from these wounds,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.910
there's no mistaking that
I was attacked with a Senbon.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.650
But no vital areas have
been targeted so far.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.590
Does he mean to half-kill me…?

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.620
If so!

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.660
As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.200
It's impossible.
lt's too much for Naruto!

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.470
I should be the one to…

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.270
Hey. Don't get any ideas…

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.640
If you move,

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.880
you know what'll happen
to that old man, right?

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.580
True…

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.580
If I move away from here and
head towards Naruto,

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.650
Zabuza will kill Tazuna.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.820
No way can Sakura completely
protect him by herself.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.060
How about it?

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:06.330
Let's just see how those young guys
fight against each other.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.670
That mask…

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.700
You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,
weren't you!

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.940
You've got nerve to deceive us!

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.310
I'm sorry.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.580
But, your teacher also said it,
didn't he?

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.420
Things like deceiving and
catching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.250
Please don't take it personally.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.060
You don't have that luxury, either!

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.660
Huh?

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.900
Sasuke?

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.840
I haven't…forgotten about you.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.640
Here I thought he had disappeared…
but he was there…

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.020
I would rather you had
just gone down quietly.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.650
But it looks like it won't work
that way.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.650
Fine. I'll put an end to it first.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.060
H-Hey!

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.990
Naruto. I'll get to you later.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.500
W-What's with him…?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.000
This is it!

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.650
So the real body is over there, eh…

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:30.650
Okay!

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.120
I'm over here.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.660
He moved…? How?!

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.180
– Sasuke! 					– Sasuke!

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.350
What was that just now?!

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.320
Sasuke's body suddenly got battered…

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.590
How's he doing it?!

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.160
What kind of Jutsu is he using…?

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.700
It's conceivable that he has clones
hide in the mirrors and

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.340
gets them all to throw
the Senbons simultaneously…

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.640
No, they're too fast considering…

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.910
What does it mean...

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.670
not being able to see even
the trajectory of the weapons…?

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.780
Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu…

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.650
I don't see a reason for
these ice mirrors…

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.160
In any case, there's no way to question
that these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:56.370
What I can do is to launch attacks…

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.700
from both the outside and inside.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.870
The thing to do is to figure out
the meaning of the mirror!

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.940
I'll take care of here!

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.320
All there is to do is…

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.620
for me to attack the inside and have Naruto
try attacking the mirrors from the outside.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.420
Yo! I came to save you.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.460
You okay, Sasuke?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.660
Oh…

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.270
What good will it do you
to catch your ally off guard…?

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.770
Y-You idiot!

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.770
If you're a Shinobi,
you'll move more cautiously!

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.510
What's with you?!

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.640
I came to the rescue, you know!

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.440
If you also come inside the mirrors…

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.210
Dang it! I've had it, you fool!

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.650
Fool?
What do you mean by fool?!

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.120
As to be expected of the
number one unpredictable Ninja.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.620
He is making the situation worse and
worse by coming to aid.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.660
Since it's come to this,
all that is left is to smash the mirrors!

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.000
Fire Style!

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.900
Hey! What're you going to do?!

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.840
These are mirrors made
with freezing water…

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.170
If so…

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.010
Fireball Jutsu!

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.620
It's not working at all!

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.760
They won't melt with that
level of firepower.

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.640
Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!
ls it the clones?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.080
Where's the real body?!

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.250
It's useless for you to even
attempt following with your eyes.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.650
I absolutely will not be caught.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.660
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.660
Don't!

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:07.460
If so, I'll find out which is
the real body by hitting them all!

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:34.560
This is a teleportation Jutsu that uses
mirrors that can reflect only my image.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.790
Watching you from the speed I move,

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.700
it almost seems as if
you aren't moving at all…

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.030
I knew it!

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:44.900
Is that Jutsu…the Kekkei Genkai?!

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.640
Kekkei…Genkai…?

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.640
It's the same type as my Sharingan…

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.850
Deep blood ties…
Lineage of paranormal individuals…

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.650
A type of Jutsu that is passed on
only through those traits…

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.020
Then…!

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.420
That's right…

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.660
It's impossible even for me
to copy that Jutsu…

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.660
And there's no way to destroy
that Jutsu, either!

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.170
Darn it…

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.170
So…what?!

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.710
I can't die here yet.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.650
'Cause I have a dream
that I must turn into reality…

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.280
The dream to have my strength recognized
by everyone in the village…

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.850
and become the Hokage!

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:37.350
Dream…

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.610
Pathetic brat.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.820
Brats like you aren't needed
by anyone

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.620
and die without ever knowing
any freedom or dreams…

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.600
You have the same eyes as I do…

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.410
For me, becoming a Shinobi completely
is difficult.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.640
If I can, I don't want to kill you guys…

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.650
And I don't want to get killed
by you guys…

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.850
But if you guys are
going to come at me…

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.190
I'll kill my feelings with a sword and
completely become a Shinobi.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:51.090
This bridge is the battleground
that connects each of us to our dreams.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.400
I, for the sake of my dream.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.070
And you, for the sake of your dreams.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.770
Please don't hold it against me…

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.170
I want to protect the person dear to me…

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.610
I work for the sake of that person,
I fight for that person,

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.980
and I want to make that
person's dream a reality…

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.020
That's my dream.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.620
For the sake of the dream,
I will completely become a Shinobi...

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.190
and kill you guys!

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.900
Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.200
Cuz' I've finally discovered the way
to break through it!

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.270
Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.640
Let's pull out of this place and
go assist Kakashi Sensei.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.980
I've had this bad feeling from
a while ago.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.480
Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehow
until we get there.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.620
Next episode:
 "Zero Visibility: The Sharingan Shatters."

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.260
As for me, I'll kick butt once again!
