WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.030
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.620
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.620
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.630
Now

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.790
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.620
…bring it to an end swiftly!

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.390
I won’t let you do anything.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.990
First move, a surefire victory!

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.740
Wow! That’s amazing!

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.540
What’s with his body?!

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.110
I dislocate every joint

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.450
and with Chakra, I can control
my softened body at will.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.620
With Chakra…?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.630
I can also squeeze until
your bones break.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.660
I’ll rapidly tighten as long
as you don’t give up.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.600
I don’t know what kind of
ninja tool you’ll use…

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.600
but if I keep doing this to your body,
it will make no difference.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.370
I can break your neck right now.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.510
So hurry up and give up.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.580
No.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.620
Do you want to die?!

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.090
Idiot. You’re the one who’s
going to die.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.330
His neck is broken.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.500
What?

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.740
How ridiculous…

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.910
Phew…

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.610
Idiot.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.110
I went a little overboard and
ended up killing you.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.120
W-What?

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.790
Okay, now it’s my turn.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.500
T-This is a Puppet!

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.510
T-That’s the real body?

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.620
He’s…a Puppet Master…

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.920
He’s controlling the puppet with
Chakra from his hand!

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.830
G-Give up…!

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.840
If your bones get crushed,
you’ll be able to bend even more, huh?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.750
For once, I was close to stopping
the match in the middle.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.260
The winner, by an inability
to continue the match by the opponent,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.260
is Kankuro.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.590
Two against one is hitting
below the belt!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.500
Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.630
It’s not particularly hitting
below the belt.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.470
It’s a puppet, after all.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.570
That’s the Puppet Master Jutsu.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.670
He’s controlling the puppet with Chakra.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.610
It’s the same as using
a ninja tool-- like shuriken.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.480
They’re all great Chakra users…

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.290
I thought I could make it
kind of far with Chakra.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.790
Kunoichi Rumble:
The Rivals Get Serious!

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.680
Ino…!

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.180
You’ve got the jitters,
don’t you, Sakura?

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.280
Wha…?!

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.820
Even Sasuke collapsed.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.760
I mean, it felt like it was because
it was Sasuke that it ended at that.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.630
What’ll happen if you take part?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.830
It might be best if you quit!

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.040
Something like that
won’t work on me!

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.390
It’s okay! I can tough it out
this time around, too.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.460
Quit? Who?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.540
I can hardly wait.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.410
Cha! Bring it on!

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.620
Now then, to continue,
we will begin the fourth battle.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.860
Man, man, nothing but
weirdoes all over the place!

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.630
Don’t you say that!

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.630
You’ve got a point.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.470
You, too, Sakura?!

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.840
This isn’t the time to be laughing.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.140
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.740
I never thought…
I’d be fighting you, Sakura.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.710
And what’s more, so soon.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.680
Ino was a standout
among the rookie Kunoichi.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.250
With Sakura as her opponent,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.890
will she go…no,
can she go with serious intent?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.960
To think it would be those
two of all people.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.830
Things have gotten gloomy.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.500
I wonder if Ino’ll be okay.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.470
That’s for sure.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.000
What’re you going to do, Ino?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.540
Sakura! Good luck! Don’t lose!

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.610
Begin!

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:38.030
Oh, no. I knew it.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.500
Sakura’s totally blowing Ino away!

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.570
Idiot.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.600
Say what?!

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.040
If you’re not an idiot,
you must be sleeping, aren’t you?

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.170
Who…?!

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:51.610
Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.910
So this is their level of
hand-to-hand combat?

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.750
What?!

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.620
It’s not because they’re Kunoichi.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:58.820
Huh?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.020
It’s just that those two are lukewarm.
There’s no man or woman in battle.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.330
Lukewarm…?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:28.780
There!

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.620
Kunoichi must learn
not only Ninjutsu…

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.260
but also a wide range of
knowledge and refinement as women.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.330
If you don’t blend into enemy territory
and conduct yourselves as a normal woman…

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.300
you’ll have it rough on occasions
such as when you work as spies.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.170
Today’s class is flower arranging.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.670
Now then, everyone.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.280
Let’s gather flowers we like.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.780
Yes, ma’am!

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.420
Ino, wait up!

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.460
You’re such a klutz.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.140
I’m... not good at stuff like this.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.140
What about you, Ino?

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:06.780
That’s no good, considering
your name’s Sakura.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.110
Listen. There are tricks
to things like this.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.750
You know, as for flower arranging,

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.320
after you’ve decided on a main flower,
you add other flowers to decorate.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.390
All flowers can’t be
asserting themselves.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.260
For example…look.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.970
You can see those cosmos
flowers over there, right…?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.700
For example, if they were
the main flowers…

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.610
the thoroughwort flowers
you picked are throw-ins!

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.380
As contrasted with
spring cherry blossoms,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.450
cosmos flowers have the
name of autumn cherry blossom

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.250
and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.820
Also, they’re flowers with
the original meaning of “harmony,”

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.720
so any autumn grass would
go perfectly with them.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.540
So? Do I look as nice
as the cosmos flowers?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.240
Say, say, am I cute?

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.440
Uh…yeah.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.610
Say. What’s with the pause?

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.280
You look like you’re having
so much fun.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.790
Billboard Brow!

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.460
You’ve recently reached
adolescence, haven’t you?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.500
Don’t get too full of yourself!

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.410
Ami!

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.880
Sorry! You have such
a beautiful cylinder-shaped body

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.710
I mistook you for a vase
and put flowers in you.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.080
Ino!

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.620
Shinobi flower aconite.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.260
It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,
so you’d best spit them out.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.000
Sensei!

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.300
Only the root is poisonous, though.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:17.610
Ino is great.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.810
She knows everything,
is stylish, and is cute.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.620
Even that shuriken skill.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.720
Her Ninjutsu is great, too…

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.620
Compared to that, I…

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.130
Sakura?

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.630
If you’re a cosmos flower…

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.300
then am I a thoroughwort?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.610
What’re you saying?!

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.580
What?

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.110
Let me see…

00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.480
In a manner of speaking,
you are not a flower, but still a bud!

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:05.590
You’re right.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.710
At this point in time…

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:28.750
I don’t even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.610
What did you say?

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.620
You and Sasuke don’t go together,
and I’m totally stronger than you!

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.460
You are beneath my notice!

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.660
Sakura! Do you know who
you’re lipping off to?!

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.230
Don’t press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
169.01	01:14:49:11	01:14:50:24	I feel like...

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.610
I feel like Sakura
was out of line!

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.770
Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.
She’s scary.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.450
Hmm. That's not it...

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.080
Huh?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.620
Sakura’s not the kind of
kid to do things

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.090
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.960
She doesn’t like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.630
I’m a bud, huh…?

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.630
Say, Ino…

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.600
What?

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.540
Why…did you give this ribbon to me?

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.810
Actually…

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.450
I thought it’d be a waste for
you to wilt away as a bud.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.630
There’s no point if flowers don’t bloom.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.510
For all we know…

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:06.680
it just might...

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.490
become a flower
more beautiful than a cosmos.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.670
Thank you...

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.770
Ino!

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.710
Okay Sakura.
Let’s hurry and go pick flowers.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.380
O-Okay.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.620
What’s wrong, Sakura?

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.150
I got some dirt in
my eye when I fell…

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.120
You’re so clumsy.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.630
Ino…

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:06.600
All along, I believed in the
words you gave me then.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.670
I really thought that it would
be nice if it were so.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.610
It would be nice if I could get
a beautiful flower to bloom…

00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:21.080
I set my sights on you because
I wanted to be like you all along.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.290
Thanks to that, I’m here now.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.630
So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.670
If I can’t surpass you at your
most serious, there’s no point.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.570
W-What’s with Sakura?

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.040
Hmm.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.680
Why are those two getting that heated?!

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:27.180
Alas, he doesn’t even understand
the reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.620
Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,
is the point.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.290
Huh?

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.000
Oh, hi…

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.230
My rival from youth, Kakashi…

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.610
Oh, how hip and galling that
nonsensical reaction is.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.080
I…

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.380
got on the same team as Sasuke.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:59.620
Why are you telling me now…?

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.020
I won’t lose to you anymore, Ino.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:11.660
No matter what happens,
I won’t lose to you either, Sakura!

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.600
The ribbon…

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.270
I’m giving back the ribbon.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.820
I gave you that ribbon.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.550
Besides, a headband is something
you put on your head, right?

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:42.330
From here on, I’m no longer
a girl who will run after you, Ino.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.630
When I put this on my head,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.070
it will be as a female Shinobi
who can’t lose to you.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.610
That’s a good idea…

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.660
Me, too…

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.990
until that time.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.070
I understand…Sakura.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.450
– This time for sure...
– This time for sure...

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.620
– with full strength…
– with full strength…

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.630
– a fair…fight!
– a fair…fight!

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.890
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:30.470
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:39.940
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:48.320
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.260
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.030
You won't have to search around you

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.670
It’s all ok now.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:11.610
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.080
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:21.620
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.460
Just sing.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.690
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.030
The two are one

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:39.500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.010
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.420
Since when did she get this strong?!

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.880
Sure enough, Ino’s great.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.620
But I won’t lose.
I absolutely will not lose.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.620
It can’t be. She’s evenly
matched with me now?!

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.090
I’m not who I used to be.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.060
– The next hit is the decisive blow!
– The next hit is the decisive blow!

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.300
Next episode:
“The Ultimate Battle: Cha!”

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.170
I cannot concede this battle,
even if it’s the last thing I do!
