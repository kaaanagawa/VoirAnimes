WEBVTT

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.540
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.040
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.660
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.250
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.660
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.660
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.330
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.160
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.450
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.830
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.120
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.700
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.290
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.410
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.000
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.290
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.580
Huh? Uh… Excuse me…

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.790
Return of the Morning Mist

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.990
My mother and my father…
They didn’t have to die.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.910
Because I didn’t have strength,
the whole clan was destroyed.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.910
Everyone was killed…

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.250
Darn it…

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.080
Morning training is over!

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.540
Once I’ve eaten breakfast

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.870
I’ll get back to rigorous training!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.370
Old man…

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.540
Konohamaru…

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.620
Yo! Konohomaru.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.990
Naruto.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.830
Have you already resumed studies
at the academy?

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.000
N-No, not yet.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.250
The school buildings are damaged,
so we’re all repairing them.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.830
Is that so?

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.200
How about you, Naruto?
You’re already training?

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.040
Sort of.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.540
Wh-What?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.040
What is it?

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.870
N-No, it’s nothing…

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.750
– Hey um…! 					– Hey um…!

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.660
So what is it…?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.910
You too, Naruto, what is it?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.620
Nothing…really…

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.250
I don’t feel lonely.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.990
Huh?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.250
There’s no time to be feeling lonely.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.750
Everyone is working really hard
to rebuild the village right now.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.790
Konohamaru…

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.750
Right now, I must work for
the village even just a little bit.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.990
So Naruto, you work hard
at your training too.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.540
If you don’t,
I’ll become Hokage before you.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.660
Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.200
Besides…you have to graduate
from the Academy first.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.120
Oh, that’s right…

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.990
Oh, here it is.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.370
Here, it’s for you.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.990
A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku…

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.990
Is it okay?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.500
I already have one,
so I’m giving one to you.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.330
Thank you, Naruto.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.290
Oh! Konohamaru.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.120
Good morning.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.040
I’m going to go.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.910
We’ll work hard again today.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.700
– Yep! 					– Yep!

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.990
Today we’re fixing the blackboards.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.990
I brought paint.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.330
Well! Once I’ve eaten ramen at Ichiraku,
I’ll continue training.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.120
This is it.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.000
Th-This is…

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.450
A lot of time has passed since the death.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.080
It’s probably before
the Chunin Exam began.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.790
I see, so that's it…

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.450
That Orochimaru!

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.160
After the murder of Lord Kazekage,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.870
Orochimaru… or someone
like Kabuto played Kazekage…

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.500
How thoughtless we were…

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.540
That darn Sarutobi…

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.990
Well, it’s not that easy.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.540
The one who was your opponent
was the renowned Hokage,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.120
deemed to be strongest of
all five great nations.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.540
However…you’ve done well.
Two out of the five Kages…

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.990
Stop…

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.830
Stop giving me words of sympathy.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.580
I will kill you!

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.410
Of course, I didn’t mean to…

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.990
It’s true that we didn’t succeed
in bringing the village down…

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.700
On the other hand, another objective
of this plan, Sasuke Uchiha…

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.700
Your leash is now on him.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.580
In exchange for these arms
and all of my Jutsu…

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.750
If we could have gotten our hands
on that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.620
it wouldn’t have been a problem.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.950
However that’s a dream that
can no longer come true.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.990
He is stronger than I am.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:11.370
That is why…I pulled myself out
from that organization…

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.830
Kakashi, huh?

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.990
What does he want?

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.990
Breakfast, breakfast!

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.830
Wait for me, my ramen.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.990
Do you already know
his whereabouts?

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.830
Yes.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.370
In that case, it will be easy…

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.040
Let’s go.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.990
Here it comes, here it comes.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.990
Oh goodie, it’s just like I thought.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:04.200
Hidden Leaf Village…
has a high average score.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.410
You’re still doing such
a ridiculous thing?

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.330
Well yes, this is my research.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.700
Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.160
I wonder what you advisers
want from me.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.620
Surely, you know…

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.660
without our telling you, don’t you?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.660
You don’t have to make
such scary faces.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.990
I heard that the talks with Sand Village
have been settled without problems.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.370
The Hidden Village in the Sand
announced that

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.580
everything was Orochimaru’s handiwork.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.370
In addition, at the moment of their
complete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.330
that wasn’t a very important issue
any more.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.790
Leaf Village has no choice but
to accept their surrender and proposition

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.450
in order to restore national power.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:05.910
However, the current strength of
Leaf Village has dropped drastically.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.830
Under these conditions,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.750
our top priority must be to prepare
for any unpredicted crisis.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.790
We don’t know when any of
the neighboring nations

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.790
will come out in a bold move.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.080
Therefore, we’ve decided that until
the village gets its strength back,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.290
we should assemble the top few men
from each troop,

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.950
and form an emergency
executive committee to handle this.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.000
But first…

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.330
we need a strong, trustworthy leader.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.990
You can find the seeds of trouble
rolling around everywhere these days.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.040
It’s not just Orochimaru.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.450
You didn’t have to go through
the trouble of informing me that.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.990
Well… I’ll continue gathering materials.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.620
I’m going to tell you the basic plan.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.290
We need the Fifth Hokage right away.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.620
And yesterday at an emergency meeting
with the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.870
we decided
it would be you, Jiraiya.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.450
I’m sorry, it’s not my nature.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.200
It has been decided.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.120
Besides, if a Shinobi like you,
renowned as a Sannin, is not…

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.330
then who is?

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.080
If you want a Sannin,
there is one more left…

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.950
That Tsunade.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.250
Certainly that child probably
has that capability, but…

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.700
However, no one knows where she is.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.620
I’ll find and bring her back.
lf I do that there’s no problem, right?

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.250
But…

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.990
A wise one like Tsunade is meant to
be Hokage more than I, with no motivation.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.910
What do you want to do?

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.990
All right.
We’ll give it urgent consideration.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.250
However, we’ll have three members
from Anbu Black Ops to accompany you

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.040
as the search unit for Tsunade.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.990
Don’t worry, I won’t escape from this.
The guards are not necessary.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.290
However…

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.580
There is one guy that I want
to take with me on my trip.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.500
I’ve found an interesting egg…

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.950
What? That is absolutely strange.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.830
Sorry, but if you don’t have a ticket,
there’s no ramen.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.370
No, wait a minute!
I absolutely had one more.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.990
Huh?

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.700
The one that I gave Konohamaru,
was it the last?

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.990
Welcome!

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.250
Hey, my ramen!

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.200
"Racy Violence"

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.830
Yo, you two!

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.000
You seem to be getting along well.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.370
Fool, Anko asked me to
buy rice dumplings. That’s all.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.330
What are you doing here?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.990
While I’m here to buy offerings,
I’ve made plans to meet here…

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.450
with Sasuke.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.160
Huh, it’s rare that you wait for people.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.990
Is the offering to Obito?

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.200
Obito?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.990
Well…that’s about right.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.870
Kakashi, it’s strange for
you to be here first.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.700
Well… once in a while.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.200
I don’t do natto (fermented beans)
and sweet things.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.370
Oh… Is that so?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.290
What?!

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.660
This is absolutely positively strange!

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.700
You guys aren’t from the village…
Why in the world did you come?

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.120
I haven’t seen you for
a while Asuma, Kurenai.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.500
If you know about us,
are you former Leaf Shinobi?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.000
– Huh?! 					– Huh?!

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.080
Y-You are?!

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.540
Humph, without a doubt…

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.750
Itachi…

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.990
Uchiha.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.700
You are acquaintances of Itachi?

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.330
If so…

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.700
I’ll introduce myself as well.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.540
I’m Kisame Hoshigaki.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.990
Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.990
Never mind later,
I’m going to beat you now!

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.660
Itachi…

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.750
It seems you’re pretty unpopular
in the village too.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.540
I know you, too.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.620
Kisame Hoshigake,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.660
originally a Shinobi
of Hidden Village in the Mist.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.080
Suspected of national covert activities
and of killing a feudal lord,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.910
a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,
on the wanted list in all nations.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.370
You’re a major S-rank criminal
listed in the Bingo Book.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.450
Itachi, you have some nerve
coming back to this village

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.330
after causing that awful incident.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.700
Asuma… Kurenai…

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.410
Don’t interfere with me.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.910
I don’t intend to kill you.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.660
That’s not a line for you,
who killed your comrades.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.330
I know there’s no way
you’d come here

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.950
without any clear purpose
in those suspicious appearance.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.580
What are you after?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.870
This guy is pretty annoying.
Should we kill him?

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.990
It doesn’t look like we are able
to leave the village so smoothly…

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.160
But don’t overdo it,
your techniques tend to stand out.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.990
They're done for then.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:34.990
This is…

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.830
Genjutsu.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:50.290
Pressing down with the tip of his sword…
What strength.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.700
My large sword, Shark Skin…

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.830
doesn’t cut, but lops it off!

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.790
Kurenai… You’re late.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.990
With this…

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.250
it’s over!

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.910
Genjutsu of that level doesn’t work on me.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.990
This is…Genjutsu Reversal?

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.370
Kurenai!

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.950
There’s no time to look away.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.450
That’s what’s expected from you, Kurenai.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.160
But…

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.990
“But” this is as far as it goes…

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.250
for you.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:42.990
What?!

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.990
Water Style!

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.990
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
– Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.700
The same Jutsu as me?!

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.870
Why have you shown up too?

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.080
Well…I asked you to take care
of them earlier.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.080
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.200
Shadow clones.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.200
Kakashi…

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.750
Hatake.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.250
Cripes… So much fuss for nothing.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.700
I…

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.950
I put it under my headband

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:38.950
in order not to drop the important ticket
during morning training.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.620
Okay, that’s fine…
Eat well and do your best.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.540
Hmm?

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.990
You’re going to do it again
after this, right? Training?

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.990
Of course! I’m full of motivation.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.450
Good! Here you go.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.620
Another serving for free! Go for it!

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.500
Thank you, sir!

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:08.990
Welcome.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.040
Just like I heard…
I had to come and see it.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.370
It seems that you really
are just eating ramen.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.990
Oh, Pervy Sage!

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.910
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.870
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:41.120
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.040
It's a secondary role,

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.990
a role in the shadows

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:55.250
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:55.370 --> 00:22:00.990
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:06.040
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.000
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:20.290
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.990
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.080
Itachi Uchiha…

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.040
who became a leader of
Anbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.830
and who destroyed
the Uchiha clan single-handedly.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.040
I don’t know why he has
suddenly appeared after all this time…

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.120
But I don’t think we will
allow him to leave so easily.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.040
What is your purpose?!

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.700
Next time: “Sharingan vs. Sharingan!”
