00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:09.690
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:17.940
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.230
One more time

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.940
Are you really happy

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.480
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.190
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.890
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.480
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:54.730
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.890
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.940
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.890
One more time

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.480
Dang it!

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.980
Darn it! Things will really be bad
if it stays like this…!

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.810
I’ll have to…

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.230
I’ll have to save…
everyone for sure!

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.230
Light vs. Dark:
The Two Faces of Gaara!

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.890
So you’ll fight for the sake of others?!

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.900
That’s why you guys are
only at that level!

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.730
You don’t need a reason to fight!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.310
Only the one who remains undefeated
can actually feel his own existence!

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.980
Come on, forget about
your insignificant friends

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.730
and fight only for the sake
of your own existence!

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.480
Insignificant…

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.650
friends?

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.100
Those who hold silly sentiments
about fighting

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.560
should just die!

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.980
I'm sick of listening to you talk!

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.890
I'll clobber you for sure!

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.520
You guys misunderstand real strength!

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.890
Shut up!

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.940
W-Why…? Why is it?!

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.770
Why Yashamaru…?

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.310
Why did you, why…?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.520
Why…?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.730
Love is…

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.980
a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.650
to love and watch over that person.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.560
Just like my older sister did.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.890
You are a precious person
who is close to me, Gaara!

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.270
Always…
only Yashamaru would always…

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.230
Me…always me…

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.940
It was an order.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.270
I was commissioned to kill you…

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.980
By your father…

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.650
Lord Kazekage.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.480
My father…?

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.230
Why did my father…?

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.890
Why…? Why me?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.020
Gaara, you who were born and possessed
by the Sand Spirit Shukaku…

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.810
have been watched over
as an experiment.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.350
However, Gaara, you couldn’t
control the living spirit Shukaku,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.020
the Sand Spirit which possesses
the power of the sand.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.270
Eventually your existence would
become too dangerous for the village.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.230
Before that occurred…

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.810
So Yashamaru, you had not choice…

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.940
but to comply with my father’s order…?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.310
No… That is not correct.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.520
It is true I accepted
Lord Kazekage’s order.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.310
But if I had wanted to turn it down,
I could have turned it down.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520
Gaara…

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.100
Deep down in my heart,
I probably…

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.940
hated you.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.270
You, whose birth took the life
of my beloved older sister.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.980
The child she left behind in death…

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:49.520
Thinking that you were her remembrance,
I tried desperately to love you.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.890
However… I was not able to.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.100
My sister didn’t choose to have you.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.560
My sister became a sacrifice
for the village,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.150
and she died while
cursing this village!

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.850
From that time, I probably…

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.890
have been burdened with a wound
of the heart that could never heal.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.100
Unlike a wound on the body,
there is no ointment and sometimes,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.480
it doesn’t heal for one’s entire life.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.850
A wound of the heart?

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.900
Your name…
is the name my sister gave you.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.190
"This child’s name is Gaara…

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.770
"A devil that loves only itself…

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.890
"Love only yourself…

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.890
"And fight only for
your own sake.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.810
"If you do that,
you will continue to exist."

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.230
Such was the hope it contained.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.810
However…

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.310
my sister did not give you this name

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.060
because she was concerned
about you or loved you.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.850
The reason she gave you this name,
a name so you would continue to exist…

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.480
…was so that the deep-seated hatred
of my sister

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.480
who died hating and cursing
this village…

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.310
would remain…

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.770
and be known to all!

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.400
You were never…loved!

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.560
This is the last…

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.890
Please die…

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.650
I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.850
Love?

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.770
The sand automatically trying to
protect you is like the love of a mother.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.890
I believe that sand is filled
with your mother’s will.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.480
Love.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.650
Love only yourself.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.770
And fight only for your own sake.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.650
So that is Gaara…
That is me.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.890
I finally understand.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.230
I am alone.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.310
I will no longer believe in anyone…
or love anyone.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.400
I am alone!

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.520
Yes, I am all by myself.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.600
What’s the matter?
Hurry up and come at me!

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.440
Don't you care what happens
to your so-called precious friends?!

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.650
Sakura!

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.890
Dang it!

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.890
Naruto’s not his usual self…

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:47.150
Did something happen between them?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.190
In any case…

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.940
In any case,
I need to save Sakura!

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.270
But… what to do?!

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.850
That’s it!

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.890
Since it's come to this…
Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra…

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.440
There’s no choice
but to summon the Chief Gamabunta!

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.230
Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.850
What’s this?! You’re a little kid!

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.230
If you want something from me,
give me some snack!

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.900
If you don’t, I won’t play with you!

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.690
You know something?
I hate you frogs!

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.890
What did you say?!
Don’t make fun of amphibians! Really!

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.650
Jeez, I don’t have time to
play with you, little squirt!

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.020
Darn! Why is it…?

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.890
I practiced for so long, but with this,
there’s no other way…

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.690
I need to save everyone!

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.270
Everyone…you say?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.890
Don’t make me laugh.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.400
I fight…only for myself!

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.100
He…he’s transforming again!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.890
If you don’t take me down,
the sand over this girl won’t fall away!

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.600
Not only that, as time passes…

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.940
this sand will slowly squeeze tighter
and eventually suffocate this girl!

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.480
Sakura!

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.890
He’s getting closer and closer
to being a Perfect Possession.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.150
That Jutsu hasn’t been activated yet,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.310
but at this rate, I’ll also be…!

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.060
Those eyes…

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.190
Sand Shuriken!

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.440
You’re…really weak!

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.890
Shut up!

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.100
But what is that guy?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.690
You’re persistent…
Sarutobi Sensei!

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.650
I-It doesn’t move?!

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.440
Y-You hard-to-kill fools!

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.100
Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.520
The Leaf Village is my home!

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.650
I told you I am the pillar
of that house!

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.150
That’s why I’m saying
I will break that pillar!

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.190
As long as the people of the village

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.770
fiercely fight to protect
their dear comrades,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.690
the pillar of the Leaf Village will not
be broken by the likes of you!

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.890
I wonder about that.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.400
Do not underestimate the Hokage!

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.690
I-Impossible…!

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.520
Where is…?
Most of your Chakra should be gone!

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:24.890
Chakra and Ninjutsu are
not all there is to strength!

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.890
W-What lonely eyes…

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.770
Such lonely eyes…

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.810
This guy is also turning into a monster…
the same as me.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.310
I hated every last one of them.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.850
I didn’t understand who I was,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:16:00.600
why I was so hated,
why I even existed.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.730
In other words,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.900
you’re the Nine-Tailed Fox who killed
lruka’s parents and ruined the village!

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.190
You’ve been deceived by everyone
in the village all along!

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.890
I…

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.890
When I learned that the
Nine-Tailed Fox was inside me,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.890
everyone in the village seemed
even more cold-hearted…

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.650
I was so deeply troubled…

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.890
But…

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.600
Naruto! Let’s go have
ramen for a change!

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.940
Yay! I will, I will!

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.270
I’ll have the one with
extra BBQ pork slices!

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.900
Huh! You loser…
lf you want to beat me train harder!

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.150
Shut up! I won’t lose to you!

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.190
Hey Naruto!
What did Sasuke say about me?

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.890
He didn’t say anything…

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.150
By the way! By the way!
Wouldn't you rather know how I feel…?

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.270
Oh! Really, Sakura!

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:00.690
I’m gonna eat now!

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.020
Um… Naruto, you’ll really die if you eat
only noodles and sweet red bean porridge.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.890
You’re a Ninja,
so eat more vegetables!

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.520
Here, have some!

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.350
What?! I don’t like vegetables!

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.560
People appeared
 who acknowledged me…

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.350
That’s why I became all right,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.350
even though there was
the demon fox inside my body,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.890
or even if the people of the village
looked at me with cold eyes.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.690
Because…
I wasn’t alone anymore!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.600
I never imagined how happy and
fortunate I could feel.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.890
How really…really…

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:39.890
great it was.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.900
How truly great it was
to be here.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.690
I was relieved to know
I am allowed to be here, to exist!

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.520
That’s why it scares me
to think about the past…

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.890
That suffering is agonizing…

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.940
It’s a pitch-black hell!

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.690
If…I had remained that way, all alone…

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.890
That’s precisely why I understand!

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.650
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.560
This is the answer I came to…

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.600
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.150
I don’t know what happened, but…

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.190
This guy’s always been
suffering all alone…

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.690
Even now, without ever feeling relief…

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.150
Only able to believe in himself…

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.690
Even now, he’s battling in hell…

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.350
That’s how it is…

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.900
To him, someone like me
who's acknowledged by others…

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.350
might seem like a weakling in
a world of happiness without tension…

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.890
Can I really win against
a guy like this?

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.900
What’s the matter?!
Are you afraid of me?

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:01.440
To fight for the sake of oneself?
To fight for the sake of others?

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:06.480
You should just love yourself,
and fight for yourself!

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.230
That is the definition of
the strongest one!

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.060
Now fight me!

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.350
What happened to
the boldness you had earlier?!

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:20.270
Show me your strength!
I’ll throw that strength to the ground!

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.890
Now what’s the matter?!
lf you don’t fight me, I’ll kill that girl!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.480
Darn it!

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.650
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:40.890
Wind Style!

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.890
Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.520
This isn’t good…
He really got me.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.810
First, I’ll toy with you
without killing you!

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.650
I look forward to seeing
when and how you give up

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.190
and abandon your friends!

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.770
Naruto…

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.730
But…what is it?

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.480
It’s far from over!

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.350
N-Naruto…

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.890
What is this…this feeling?

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:39.060
Sand Shuriken!

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.520
D-Dang it!

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.810
Dang it!

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.890
H-He's…

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:57.940
What is this?!
This feeling that’s overcoming me?

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.940
Naruto…!

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.890
For some reason…
I don’t want to lose to this guy…

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.890
You…

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.020
…even if I die!

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:27.940
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:39.270
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:54.940
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.980
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.400
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.650
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:20.890
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:31.600
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:42.150
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:47.890
Forge on strong

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.730
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.690
If you're far away,
listen well.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.350
If you’re closer,
then come and watch it!

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.020
Among all the Genin in the Leaf,

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.060
I’m the only one who’s
suited to become Hokage!

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.900
I turn the biggest pinch
into opportunity

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.020
with Transform Jutsu, Summoning Jutsu,
and Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.890
I give back twice as much
when I receive a punch.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.770
I’m the hyperactive knucklehead Ninja!

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.890
This is the start of the spiraling series
of Naruto’s Ninja Handbook!

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.100
