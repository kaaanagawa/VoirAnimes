WEBVTT

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.980
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.190
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.350
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.520
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.060
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.940
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.060
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.230
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.900
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.560
Who’re you guys?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.980
I’m in a bad mood right now.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.400
If you wanna continue to fight,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.520
I won't go easy on you.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.150
You stop your babbling, weakling.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.230
Hey, come over here.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.810
I’m gonna play
do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do on you…

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.020
while I snap your ribs!

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.100
I’ll do it!

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.350
What?! He got both of my legs
with his string…!

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.060
Why you--!

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.020
Humph! Let’s hear a nice sound.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.980
Do!

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.730
W-What?!

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.480
Re!

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.600
Wh-Where is he attacking from?!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.730
Your bones make
a really low sound, don’t they?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.600
Let’s hear a much sharper reverberation,
shall we?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.190
Right?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.520
Next, I’ll go for
a mi-fa-so tri-combination.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.100
Wha--?!

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.730
What?!

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.940
Last!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.890
Lions Barrage!

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.520
An Invitation from the Sound

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.890
Here you are!

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.980
I’m digging in!

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.190
Sakura! Go on, eat, eat!

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.890
The Chinese-style barbecued pork
ramen noodles here are fabulous!

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.060
Don’t worry. It’s my treat.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.560
Right, chef?

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.890
You’re gonna treat your girl.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.900
You’re growing up, aren’t you, Naruto?

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.270
Wh-Wh-What?!

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.020
Wh-What the heck are
you talking about?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.520
I need to have an important conversation
with Sakura today…

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.890
Sh-She’s not my girl
or anything like that…

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.230
Sakura?

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.480
Sorry, Naruto. I was little spaced out.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.900
This looks delicious.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.350
Now then… Let’s eat! Let’s eat!

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.190
Yeah! Tell me about Sasuke
while we eat.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.810
Sasuke told me not to tell you this,
Naruto, but…

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.150
It’s all that guy Orochimaru’s fault…

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.900
S-Stop!

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.520
Kakashi Sensei said it would be fine
and I’d like to believe that too…

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
But when he was battling Gaara…

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.520
Earlier today…

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.890
Sasuke was wearing the same expression
as the time before.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.900
That’s why I…

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.480
Orochimaru, huh?
I ran into him again a little while back.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.600
Really? Where?!

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.270
When I was searching for
Old Lady Tsunade…

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.890
Die!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.940
Shoot!

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.690
Pervy Sage and the old lady…

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.440
Despite the fact that
he was fighting two of them at once,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.060
he was incredibly powerful.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.690
He’s one dangerous dude.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.150
That strong…

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.060
It’ll all be fine, believe it!

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.190
Sasuke wouldn’t fall to
that kind of guy’s enticement.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.060
He’s already a really powerful guy,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.310
so he wouldn’t need to do
that kind of thing!

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.940
I guarantee it!

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:03.270
Yeah!

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.890
Why does Master Orochimaru
want this guy anyway?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.850
Kimimaro would have
been much better…

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.690
Well, if you stay in
a seedy place like this,

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.560
you’ll just remain mediocre at best.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.020
You’ll never become strong…

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.230
Wh-Why…?

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.350
All my barrages were solid.
Yet this guy…

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.100
doesn't seem to have
sustained any damage.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.890
If you keep on fooling around
playing Ninja with your friends,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.100
you’re just gonna continue to rot.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.730
Come with us.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.400
If you do,
Master Orochimaru will empower you.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.650
There’s no meaning
if we take you by force, he said.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.690
You decide.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.440
Gimme a break…

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.770
Master Orochimaru sure sent me
on a bothersome mission.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.890
Hey! What did you decide?

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.480
Are you coming?

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.600
Or are you not coming?!

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:23.560
Decide already!

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.350
When a weakling like you lags,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.940
it makes me wanna just finish you!

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.230
Try me…!

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.770
You…those Curse Marks…

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.980
Don’t be so sure that

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.150
you’re the only favorite
of Master Orochimaru.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.690
One shouldn’t use Curse Marks
that lightly.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.810
Or rather…it looks like you’re not
even able to control the Curse Marks.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.560
If they continue to be released
for a long period of time,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.480
Curse Marks will progressively
eat your body.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.810
It looks like you’re still at first state,

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.940
so the speed at which they will
eat away at you is still fairly slow.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.770
But when they have entirely eaten you,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.230
you will lose yourself.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.020
Forever.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.690
In exchange for having been
empowered by Curse Marks,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.850
you will be tethered
by Master Orochimaru.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.350
We no longer have anything
like freedom.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.890
In order to receive something,
one must discard something.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.520
What is your objective?

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.100
Are you and your comrades
just going to comfort each other

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.890
in this lukewarm village…

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.020
then simply forget all about…

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.690
Itachi Uchiha?

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.890
Don’t forget your objective.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.150
This kind of village does
nothing more than shackle you!

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.150
Cut your stupid ties with this place.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.440
If you do that, you’ll…

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.480
be able to obtain much,
more fabulous power.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.900
Don’t forget your objective!

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.150
Thanks!

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.890
H-Hey Sakura.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.400
I’ll walk you home!

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:53.890
Huh? Don’t worry about it.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.350
Why, why?
The streets are dangerous at night!

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.850
They’re well lit, so I’ll be fine…

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.400
Sakura?

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.890
Thanks, Naruto.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.890
But I want to go home alone tonight.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.810
I see…

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.810
I’ll be fine!

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.890
Yeah!

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.350
Why are you hanging around in a place
like this in the middle of the night?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.890
One has to pass down this road
to leave the village.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.190
Go home and sleep.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:26.980
Why…

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.770
Why won’t you tell me anything?

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.600
Why are you always silent like that?

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.480
You won’t tell me one single thing.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.730
Why should I have to tell you anything?!

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.730
I’m telling you to keep your nose
out of my business.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.400
Stop bothering me
over everything I do.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.650
I…make you dislike me
all the time, don’t I?

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:58.730
Do you remember?

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.100
We just became Genin and
the Three-Man Squads were assigned…

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.770
You and I were alone for
the first time, here at this very spot.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.890
You got mad at me.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.190
See! That guy doesn’t
have parents, right?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.400
He’s all alone and he doesn’t have to deal
with parents lecturing him…

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.890
That’s why he can sometimes
be selfish!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.100
Solitude…

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.190
Huh?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.890
Isn’t the same as being scolded
by one’s parents.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.440
What’s the matter all of a sudden….

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.150
You…are annoying…

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.520
I don’t remember that.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.890
Yeah, I guess…
that was long ago, after all…

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.400
But it all began that day.

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.560
Sasuke and me…

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.890
And also Naruto and Kakashi Sensei…

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.270
The four of us went
on various missions, didn’t we?

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.940
Those were tough and
difficult times, but…

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.650
But…

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.480
more than anything…

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.890
it was so much fun!

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.770
I know about your family, Sasuke…

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.690
But revenge…

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.770
that won’t bring anyone happiness.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.270
No one…

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.150
Neither you…

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.890
nor I.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.890
As I expected…

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.890
I’m different from you guys…

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.350
I’m walking a road that’s incompatible
with the rest of you.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:50.940
The four of us worked together…

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.600
and it’s true that there was a time
when I thought that was my road.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.650
The four of us have worked together,

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.060
but in the end,
I decided on revenge.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.600
That’s been my reason for living.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.810
I can’t become like
you and Naruto.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.890
Are you going to isolate
yourself again, Sasuke?!

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.890
You taught me that solitude
is a very rough thing that time, Sasuke!

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.980
Now I know exactly how that feels.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.890
I have both family and friends…

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.400
But if you were no longer here, Sasuke…

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.400
for me…

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.400
for me it would be the same as solitude.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.150
From here again…

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.400
we’re going to start walking
our new paths individually.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.350
I…!

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.060
I love you so very, very much, Sasuke!

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.600
If you would only be with me, Sasuke,

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.770
I won't let you regret it,
no matter what!

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.900
I’ll make it fun every day and
you will definitely find happiness!

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.940
I’ll do anything for you, Sasuke!

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.150
So…I’m begging you,
please stay here!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.980
I’ll even help you with your revenge!

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.310
I’ll make it happen somehow,
I promise you…!

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.400
So stay here…with me…!

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.850
If that doesn’t work for you…

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.440
Then take me with you…

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.270
You really are…annoying.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.190
Don’t go!

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.890
If you go, I’ll scream and…

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.440
Sakura…

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.890
Thank you…

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.560
Sasuke…

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.890
We were waiting for you, Master Sasuke.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.100
What’s your intention?

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.890
It was already decided that
you would be our leader

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.020
the moment you exited the village.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.890
Please forgive our rudeness
up to now.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.890
I don’t care about any of that.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.100
Let’s go.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.400
This is the beginning!

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:32.890
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:38.480
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.770
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:53.900
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.650
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.690
Look like a mountain

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.350
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.190
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.520
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.770
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.890
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.100
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.850
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.940
Look like a mountain

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.480
What? That jerk Sasuke.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.020
What the heck is he thinking?
He has such a twisted personality!

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.890
What is it that he disliked so much
that he'd do something like this?!

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.560
Damn! I'm not about to let that guy
do whatever he wants!

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.600
If things come to this, I'll chase him
down to the end of the world.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:11.100
I'll drag that guy back
even if I have to grab him by his neck!

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.150
Next time:
 "Formation! The Sasuke Retrieval Squad!"
