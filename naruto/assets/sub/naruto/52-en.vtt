WEBVTT

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.490
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.390
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.500
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.260
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.440
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.750
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.320
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.850
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.860
It will come, closer

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.860
Now

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.140
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.610
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.440
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.850
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.620
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.950
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.360
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.780
Umm, where’s the room
that Sasuke’s in?

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.190
Mr. Sasuke is not allowed
any visitors.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.860
What?! Hey, hey!
What's up with that?!

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.460
I’m sorry,
those are the rules.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.860
Why, Sis, tell me why?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.860
Naruto, this is a hospital.
Keep it down.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.200
Say! Say!
I've got a favor to ask!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.700
You don’t need to say it all.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.200
Well, I thought it would
come to this so…

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.610
I searched for someone
to watch your training.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.970
Why?!

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.110
I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.410
I have some matters
to take care of.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.950
I don’t have time to
trouble myself with you.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.690
Oh! Aha...!

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.860
You’re going to
train Sasuke, aren’t you?!

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.720
Well... don't say that.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.260
I found a sensei who’s
more reliable than I am!

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.260
Well…who is it?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
It’s me!

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.030
Huh?!

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.230
Oh!

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.100
You!

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.900
The Closet Perv!

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.200
Such insolence!

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.840
Ebisu Returns:
Naruto's Toughest Training Yet!

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.750
Ebisu Sensei is
a Closet Perv?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.930
Why’s this guy
my training teacher?!

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.930
In the first place,
he’s weaker than me!

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.900
What did you say?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.070
But you see! But you see!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.900
A long time ago,
with my Harem Jutsu, this guy…

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.400
Transform!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.610
Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.650
B-By any chance…

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.020
Harem Jutsu?

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.860
U-Uh…it’s nothing!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.060
I’ll treat you to and buy you
whatever you want later!

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.860
Just be quiet about that!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.100
You better.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.370
Wow, I didn’t know you
were acquainted.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.840
Well, they’re unsavory ties, but.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.840
How could I ever forget
that humiliation?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.010
But why this guy?

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.650
I definitely don’t want him to.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.050
Same here.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.850
If it weren’t Kakashi’s favor,
who’d teach you for the fun of it?

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.860
Then don’t.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.320
Now now, both of you…

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.890
Don’t say that.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.930
Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.870
who teaches the elite,
a special Jonin!

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.440
He’s truly better
at teaching than I am.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.410
Well, Naruto, of the three kids
in Squad Seven that I taught,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.850
you’re the worst at the basic skills.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.450
Get taught with care
this time around.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.560
How the heck am I inferior
compared to Sakura and Sasuke?!

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.760
Naruto, it’s fact that you
don’t have the fundamentals down.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.930
No matter what you do,
the basic skills are important.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.840
If you really want to become strong,
just be quiet and listen to what I say.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.440
Now then, Ebisu Sensei,
I’m leaving him with you.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.850
Yes, yes.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.450
Dang it.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.850
It may appear to be harsh,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.520
but you can become stronger
a lot more.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.260
Do your best.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.560
Okay, then, let’s go.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.530
Still, I’m not convinced…

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.530
Huh?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.630
You see!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.370
Fundamentals might be important,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.780
but I won’t get strong being taught
by someone weaker than me!

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.150
So in other words,
you want to say that I’m weak?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.450
Who else is here?!

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.850
I was certainly surprised having
that indecent Jutsu used on me that time.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.890
But it’s premature for you to
judge my ability on just that.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.890
Even though you were
totally knocked out.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.300
Fine.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.870
Then, why don’t we put
it to the test?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.700
Hmm?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.370
Naruto, run.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.200
Huh?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.840
If you can get to outrun me,
I’ll back down quietly.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.650
Back down…?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.450
Yes.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.980
And of course, I’ll speak to
Kakashi Sensei

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.720
about you receiving direct training.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.220
What?! Really?!

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.190
This elite instructor does not
go back on his word.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.760
However, this is only if
you can outrun me.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.700
Then that makes it easy!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.270
See ya!

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.980
This’ll be a snap, a snap!

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.620
I’ll lose that…
Closet Perv in no time!

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.130
He already can’t catch up!

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.400
I knew I was quite
an exceptional Ninja…

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.330
Who is exceptional, you say?

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.870
Surely you’re not thinking you can
outrun me with just that much.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.810
W-What’re you saying?!

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.910
The chase has still…

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.420
only just begun!

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.000
Though he’s a Closet Perv,

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.500
he’s the elite tutor after all,
he’s good.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.940
Now then.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.910
I knew you were Closet Perv.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.740
What are you doing…?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.110
Naruto?

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.950
I see. The idea isn’t bad.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.990
Then, how about this?!

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.820
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.000
Heh!

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.930
Catch me…if you can!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.170
Not bad…

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:53.980
However, you are not the only one
who uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.980
I won’t let you get away!

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.290
Dang it!

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.500
Son…of…a...!

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.920
Now then, next.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.990
Hold it!

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:45.400
I found you!

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.330
Wait!

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.570
I won’t let you get away!

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.440
Get off!

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.570
There! No, actually, here!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.770
Here!

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.980
There!

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.980
There!

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.440
Hold it!

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.160
Have you reached your limit?

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.160
You’re freaking pesky!

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.330
Give it up already!

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.570
What are you snapping
back at me for?

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.910
This is a chase, so chasing
is natural, right?

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.140
T-True enough…

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.950
Naruto, you have understood
my greatness by now, right?

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.150
It’s about time you surrendered
and moved on to training--

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.250
The heck with that!

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.190
I’m going to bump you off,
and receive Kakashi Sensei’s training!

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.830
Even if I have to knock you out!

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.900
It appears you still have
some spirit left.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.010
To think he would come at me
head on, even though this is a chase.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.140
Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.750
As Kakashi said, he’s the
number one unpredictability Ninja.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.310
Don’t take this badly!

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.320
Eat this!

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.150
Clone Jutsu…?

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.140
The game is over, Naruto!

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.170
Dang it!

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.120
Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles and
salt-flavor ramen noodles!

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.950
Here you go!

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.020
Naruto, having been shown
your movements and

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.430
having further analyzed
what Kakashi has told me…

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.470
it is clear that you cannot control
Chakra well.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.270
Control…?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.270
That’s right.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.470
Now then, comparing you
with Sasuke and Sakura …

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.240
I shall explain your
bad points in order.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.120
As you know, in the case of using
Ninjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.250
Ninjas build up Chakra and
activate the Jutsu.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.220
I-I know that already!

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.090
Is that so?

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.760
Then, in the case of comparing
the three of you,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.500
I shall explain specifically
how you are inferior.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.370
That’s kind of an irritating
way of saying it.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.440
I’m treating you the ramen
as promised,

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.770
so be quiet and listen!

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.780
First, let us say that Sakura
uses Clone Jutsu.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.310
Clone Jutsu!

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:56.220
In her case, her build-up control as well as
her control of Chakra is perfect,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.120
so she can make clones without
using wasteful energy.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.260
Cha!

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.030
Next, in Sasuke’s case,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.300
he is somewhat poor at
building up Chakra.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.200
Clone Jutsu.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.780
But, his control of Chakra is perfect,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.210
so both he and Sakura can
make five clones.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.620
But, he uses a bit more wasteful
Chakra than Sakura.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.090
Oh!

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.260
So Sasuke’s nothing special.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.430
In your case, there’s no time
to be laughing at others.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:36.290
Huh?

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.900
You are very poor at building up Chakra
and controlling it,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.840
so you cannot make clones
with the same amount of Chakra.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.040
In the case where you strain to
make clones despite that,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.650
after consuming a much larger amount
of Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke…

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.150
Clone Jutsu!

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.490
...you can barely make
one clone at best.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.490
By the way,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.520
Sakura and Sasuke can become ten
with the same amount of Chakra.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.470
Like this, the three of you are
this different even using the same Jutsu.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:25.380
Well, this is a somewhat exaggerated
comparison of you three,

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.280
but you build up too much Chakra,
use too much physical strength,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.480
and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.820
But, there’ve been times when
I was greater than Sakura and Sasuke…

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.290
That’s only because you
happen to have

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.160
the most outstanding stamina
of the three!

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.530
Well, I am pretty sure that
your Chakra control

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.170
is getting difficult due to the influence
of the Nine-Tails…

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.500
which is the origin of your stamina.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.380
Anyway, there is no mistaking
that you can become strong

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.740
if you carry out the training
we will be doing from now.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.480
Huh?! Really?!

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.680
I guarantee it.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.820
Now then, let’s go.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.850
Sir, your bill.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.650
Oh, that’s right.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.960
Wha--?!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.160
Thank you very much!

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.480
We’ve come quite a long way…

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.880
But, this is a hot spring town, right?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.620
It doesn’t look like we’ve come
here to leisurely soak in a hot spring…

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.490
Hey! Naruto!

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.990
That’s the women’s bath!

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.490
I simply will not allow
indecent behavior!

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.160
Huh?

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.990
I’m not you…

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.060
It’s not that I was trying to peep.
Believe it!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.400
Thinking of something like that
in the first place makes you a Closet Perv!

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.570
What’s with that look?

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.270
N-Nothing.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.480
More importantly, why’ve we come
to a place like this?!

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.180
Will soaking in a hot spring
do anything for training?

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.480
No!

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.850
The training will be here
in this hot spring area!

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.120
Okay, this is the place.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.790
It’s a bath, sure enough!

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.700
What are you saying?

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.500
I said this is training, didn’t I?
Training!

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.430
We’re going to train here?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.100
What the heck are we going to do?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.640
Walk on this hot water!

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.880
What?!

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.250
What is it?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.120
Walk on hot water?

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.350
Can you really do that?

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.620
Of course!

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.490
I heard from Kakashi Sensei.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.560
You already did tree-climbing training
without using your hands, right?

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.430
It’s an application of that.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.500
Hmm… 					What do you mean?

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.400
Besides, I don’t really remember
stuff from long ago!

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.470
In tree climbing, all you do
is accumulate

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.880
only the necessary amount of Chakra
in one necessary location

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.480
and maintain that amount of
Chakra all the while.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.420
Trees are fixed objects,
so you only need to be attached to it.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.850
In other words,

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.290
it’s training for building up
a fixed amount of Chakra.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.620
To float on the surface of water,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.860
you have to discharge on
a constant basis

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.260
an appropriate amount of Chakra
from your feet to the water

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.230
and balance that to the extent that
you can float your own body.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.570
Huh?

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.070
This Chakra control is
more difficult than maintaining…

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.480
and is a control training for
discharge and usage of fixed amount

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.540
of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.550
Hmm, I really don’t get it!

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.150
Well, it would be better to
show you in your case.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:57.190
First, you build up Chakra
in your feet.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:02.530
Then, while constantly discharging
a fixed amount…

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.030
you balance it with your body weight.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.130
And…

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.970
well, this is how it goes.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.470
Oh! Okay! 					I’m going to try!

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.680
First, you build up Chakra
in your feet.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.980
Then!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.010
Discharge a fixed amount. Right?

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.180
Oh!

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.680
I knew it.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.690
Hot-hot-hot-hot!

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.220
I forgot to mention it,
but this hot water is 60° C.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.520
If you do nothing but fail…

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.690
you will become a boiled octopus!

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.100
Dang it!

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.500
I’ll do it no matter what!

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.620
You’re unusually spirited today,
honored grandson!

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.990
My principle of guidance
has finally gotten through!

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.760
This would ordinarily be the
time to go carry out

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.760
a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.700
I’ve stopped doing that now!

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.300
That’s right!

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.370
So you have finally understood.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.810
That the shortcut to becoming
the Hokage is to do as I say…

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.510
There are no shortcuts!

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:26.710
Huh?

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.750
Brother Naruto said it…

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.690
If you’re to become Hokage,
be prepared for that!

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.090
Oh!

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.200
I’m starting to get it!

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.300
To think he would get the
hang of the Chakra control this quickly…

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.670
I never thought,
you would grow this much.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.110
Indeed, there are no shortcuts,
in anything…

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.680
It appears I had the
wrong idea about you…

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.320
You are a much smarter teacher
than I am.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.690
And, you were not just a Demon Fox…

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.790
You were a splendid
Hidden Leaf Village Ninja!

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.030
Oh! Hot!

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.700
Hm?! That is…!

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.410
Humph! I don’t know who you are
or where you’re from, but…

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.480
I will not allow indecency!

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.680
Man…

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.250
T-That is!

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.050
What?!

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.030
Don’t make a ruckus.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.670
Jeez, it won’t do to be found out!

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.440
The Closet Perv lost?

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.110
W-What’s with that
Shameless Perv?!

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.530
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.770
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.410
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.680
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:45.080
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:52.460
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.200
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.640
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.840
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.280
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me your hand!

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:22.550
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.830
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:36.500
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:43.670
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you!

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.220
What’re you doing,
Shameless Perv?!

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.690
Here I was having my training watched,
and you did this to the Closet Perv!

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.690
And you’re so infernally
quick at running away.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.700
Could he be a super Ninja?

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.700
Next episode.
“Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!”

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.110
I’ll chase him down and make him
train me without fail!

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.090
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.690
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
