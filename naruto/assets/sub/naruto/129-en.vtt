WEBVTT

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.620
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.370
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.160
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.490
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.500
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.950
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.410
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.910
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.370
All the kids said

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.370
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.580
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.250
All the kids said

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.080
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.700
All the kids said

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.160
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.000
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.330
All the kids took off

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.750
into this windless night

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.290
Because they want to change something

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.540
Sasuke!

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.410
You punk!

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.120
What’s with…this guy?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.000
Why…?

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.500
Damn it…

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.950
Is this the best you’ve got…?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.950
If this is all you’ve got,
I still don’t need to use that…

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.490
What?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.750
You haven’t realized it?
I…haven’t used my Sharingan.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.290
Don’t mock me!

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.950
You don’t have enough strength
or desire…

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.870
You are weak.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.490
Why you are weak?
Because you don’t have enough…hatred.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.580
If I kept playing comrade with you guys…

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.790
I wouldn’t have…been able to get…

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.580
…this much power!

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.870
That’s right…I need …

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.700
Both power…and hatred…
in order to catch up with him.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.490
Brothers:
                     Distance Among the Uchiha

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.410
Big Brother…I’ll get off.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.490
Don’t push it…

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.250
Okay…

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.660
Oh…

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.040
What’s up?

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.660
This is the place…
where Father works, right?

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.870
Yeah…The headquarters
of the Leaf Police Force.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.580
I was curious about it from before,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.450
but why’s the Uchiha Clan crest
on the Police Force mark?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.290
Oh… so you noticed, huh?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.250
Of course…

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.490
Yeah…Let me see…
To put it simply…

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.080
it seems the previous generations
of the Uchiha Clan

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.040
set up and established the Police Force.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.580
So they used their own crest for
the symbol mark of this organization.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.620
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has always been

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.540
in charge of protecting
the public and the peace of this village.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.830
The Uchiha crest is
a testament to the proud clan.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.290
The Uchiha Clan has gotten small now.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.870
But even now, nearly all members
belong to this first force here.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.490
and contribute to maintaining
peace in the village.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.620
Only even more exceptional Shinobi
can crack down on the crimes

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.410
committed by Shinobi, so…

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.750
Sure enough, father’s awesome!

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.580
Leaf Police Force
		Are you going to enter
		the Police Force, too?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.410
Well…I’m not sure…

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.540
Why not?!

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.490
When I grow up, I’m also going
to enter the Police Force, so!

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.490
Father’s also coming to
tomorrow’s entrance ceremony.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.490
It’s the first step to my dream.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.790
That’s right.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.490
You’re late…What were you doing?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.410
Father…

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.490
I have something to talk to you about.
Come quickly.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.750
That's my boy.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.660
You’ve come this far just half a year
after being promoted to Chunin.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.410
About tomorrow’s special mission…

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.500
I’ve decided to go with you, too.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:20.580
Tomorrow?

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.540
If you complete this mission, Itachi…

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.250
your entrance into
the Anbu Black Ops is almost assured!

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.490
You understand, right?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.500
You don’t have to be so worried.
More importantly…

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.830
Umm… Father…

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.370
Tomorrow’s my…

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.700
Tomorrow’s mission will be
a very important mission not just for you,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.500
but for the Uchiha Clan!

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.120
I’m quitting tomorrow’s mission, after all.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.160
What’re you doing talking insanity?!

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.490
You should know how important
a day tomorrow is!

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.450
I’m going to Sasuke’s Academy
entrance ceremony tomorrow…

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.580
The general rule is for relatives
to attend the Academy entrance ceremony.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.120
There was the notice, right… Father?

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.490
I get it already.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.450
I’ll go to the Academy…

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.910
Your left leg…

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.580
Be sure to ice it.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.410
Right…

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.660
Big Brother… He’s so distant…

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.120
Entrance Ceremony

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.290
Everyone! Congratulations
on your entrance!

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:03.620
From here on, please work very hard
towards striving for the Shinobi path.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.830
And I’d like you to bring further prosperity
to the Hidden Village in the Leaf.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.250
Gee… I remember
the time when Itachi entered.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.500
Just what I’d expect from his brother.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.790
Thank you for your help with both boys.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.080
Oh, it’s nothing like that.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.490
The first prodigy since the beginning
of the Academy…

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.660
There were no students
as exceptional as that boy.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.490
That’s a bit too much praise.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.660
Not at all…

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.450
I’m hopeful for you, too.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.540
Become a fine Shinobi
like your big brother.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.790
Yes.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.620
Hey…That’s Uchiha, right?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.290
Yeah.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.500
I wonder…if he’s awesome, too.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.370
Hmm…Must be.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.660
Recess at last! What a drag.
I’m still not used to this place…

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.490
You want some too, Shikamaru?

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.790
I mean, all of your recesses
have become meal times.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.160
That’s my boy…

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.490
I’ve great confidence
you’ll make it great in Anbu.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.660
This won’t do!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.450
Won’t do!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.790
I’ve got a long way…to go…

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.500
Really…

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.490
You should rest your body
on your days off at least.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.490
You don’t have to push it.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.700
I heard…that Big Brother graduated
from the Academy in just one year.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.910
The times are different, then and now.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.660
Besides, that kid is a bit special, so…

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.490
That’s my boy…

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.450
Now, I’m going to hand out
the report cards for the first half.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.550
Taijutsu: 1st in class and academy
Ninjutsu: 1st in class and academy
		lndividual rank: 1st in class and academy
		Team rank: 1st in class and academy

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.790
Do a fine job in this vein like
your big brother.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:15.870
Father… I wanted you to say,
“That’s my boy,” to me…

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.330
What did you say?

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.120
What do you mean you can’t participate
in the assembly tomorrow?!

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.490
You don’t understand your own position!

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.830
I’m setting out on a mission tomorrow.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.750
What’re they doing this late
at night with the lights off?

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.500
What mission?!

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.410
I can’t say…
lt’s a top secret mission.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.370
Itachi…You also have the role
of the pipe which connects the clan

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.200
with the keystone of the village.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.250
You know that, don’t you?

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:00.790
Yeah…

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.580
Keep that well in mind!
And come to tomorrow’s assembly!

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.700
Sasuke…

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.450
Get to bed after
you’ve gone to the bathroom.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.540
Right…

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.750
What’re you doing hanging around
this late at night?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.370
Get to bed!

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.620
Okay.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.490
Report Card

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.580
Father only thinks about you, Big Brother…

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.580
Am I loathsome to you?

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:44.910
It’s okay.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.910
It’s logical for Shinobi to be
ill-thought of by people, so…

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.910
That's not how I feel…

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.160
Brother's right.
I really do…think ill of him…

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.080
Excellence is not easy at all.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.490
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.370
Even if you’re coveted
and sought after at first.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.410
But, we only have each other
for siblings.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.000
I will continue to exist with you
as a wall you must get over…

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.080
Even if I’m ill-thought of…
That’s what a big brother is.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.200
Is Itachi home?!

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:33.200
I have something to
talk to you about. Come out!

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.490
Why’s everyone gathered here?

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:44.080
There are two people who didn’t come
to yesterday’s assembly.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.490
Why didn’t you come?!

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:52.910
He didn’t go to the assembly Father
was talking about last night, after all.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.120
I understand that when you enter Anbu,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.490
you get roped into various
troublesome things.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.660
Your father also said something
like that in your defense.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.410
But for us, we don’t intend
to treat you special.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.620
Understood. I shall be careful next time.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.370
Now I’m going to have
to ask you to leave.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:20.370
Right… But before that,
there’s a little more I want to ask you…

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.160
It’s about Shisui Uchiha who threw himself
into the Nakano River to kill himself.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.830
Threw himself?!

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.790
The other person who didn’t come
to the assembly is that Shisui.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.290
As I recall, you adored him
like a real older brother.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.490
I see… I hadn’t seen him at all recently.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.870
That’s too bad.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.660
And we the Police Force have decided
to launch an all-out investigation.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.330
Investigation?!

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.490
This is the will Shisui wrote.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.870
The analysis of the handwriting
has been completed.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.540
No mistake, he did indeed write it.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:13.490
If there are no murder leads,
then what’s the investigation?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.790
It’d be easy for a person who can use
Sharingan to copy handwriting, you see…

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.490
The most adept Uchiha.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.490
The man feared as Shisui,
“the Instantaneous Man.”

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.830
He was a man who would take
the lead no matter what the mission

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.490
if it was for the sake of the clan.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.290
It’s tough to think that

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.580
such a man would leave something
like this and kill himself.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.410
You shouldn’t judge people…
only on looks and speculation.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.040
For the time being,
I leave the will with you.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:51.450
Take that and you request cooperation
in the investigation from Anbu Black Ops.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.200
Understood…

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.490
I hope we get a lead.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.660
Also, we have a different route
to Anbu Black Ops.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.410
We’ll know right away if you do something
like crushing the investigation request.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:12.870
Why don’t you just come right out
and say it?

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.250
You suspect me, right?

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.370
Yeah. That’s right, you little punk…

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.870
Listen up, Itachi.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.950
Just try doing something
like betraying the clan and…

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.870
it’ll cost you!

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.750
I told you before.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.490
You shouldn’t judge people…
only on looks and speculation.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.490
It’s because you take the liberty to
judge me as patient and take me lightly.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.870
Clan…Clan…

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:55.410
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own vessels

00:16:55.450 --> 00:17:00.620
and don’t know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there…

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.490
I’ve never seen him like this…

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:08.490
Shisui…was monitoring you recently…

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.120
Half a year after entering Anbu…

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.330
the strangeness of your behavior
couldn’t be overlooked.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.700
What the hell are you thinking?

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.660
Fixated on the organization,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.870
fixated on the clan,
fixated on the name.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.450
It’s a dreadful thing that constrains oneself
and labels one’s own vessel.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.000
And it’s a foolish thing…

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.790
that fear and hate…
what one has never seen or known…

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.200
Stop, Itachi!

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.250
What the hell’s the matter
with you?!

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.750
Itachi…
You’ve been a little strange lately.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.580
I’m not strange at all.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.830
I’m carrying out my own role…
That’s it.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.830
Then why didn’t you come last night?

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.490
In order to elevate myself higher…

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.540
What’re you talking about…?

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.830
My vessel is dismayed
at this foolish clan!

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.160
From olden times,
the Uchiha Clan has all along

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.950
been in charge protecting
the peace of this village.

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.490
The Uchiha crest is a testament
to the proud clan.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.200
That’s my boy…

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.830
I’ve great confidence
you’ll do great in Anbu Black Ops.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:40.160
Because you're fixated
on insignificant things like clans…

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.750
you lose sight of what’s truly important.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.120
True change cannot be made if stuck
within the restrictions of regulations,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.490
and constrained predictions
and imagination…

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.870
Saying such arrogant things!

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:57.450
Enough! You’ll be imprisoned
if you say any more foolish nonsense.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.540
Excellence is not easy at all.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.910
If you have power,
you become alienated and also arrogant…

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.000
even if you’re coveted
and sought after at first…

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.490
Why… Big Brother…?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.200
What do you say?!

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.950
I can’t tolerate it anymore…
Captain, order imprisonment!

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.700
Big Brother! Stop it already!

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.540
I’m not the one who killed Shisui.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.410
But I apologize for
my numerous slips of the tongue.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.490
I’m very sorry…

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.490
Recently, it seems he’s been up
to his ears in Anbu Black Ops missions

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.410
and was a little tired…

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.500
Captain!

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.950
The Anbu Black Ops is a force
under the direct control of Lord Hokage…

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.750
Even we the Police Force can’t arrest him,
if we don’t have an arrest warrant.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.660
And as for Itachi…

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.000
I will take the responsibility
and monitor him.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.250
Please…

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.660
Understood…

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.750
With this, you’ve woken up, right?

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.500
We had a hindrance back at that time…

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.120
But it won’t be like that this time.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.040
I’ll show you…
the true power of Sharingan.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:28.700
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:35.160
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:45.620
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:55.490
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.330
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:11.490
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:23.330
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:33.620
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.490
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.000
Give me all you've got,
Naruto.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.040
Or is this all you've got?

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.870
You were talking impudently
about your Way of Ninja

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.500
and this is all you've got?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:11.490
You've gotta be kidding! Right now,
you're not even worth beating!

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:15.160
