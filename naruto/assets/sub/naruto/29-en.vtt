WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.290
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.690
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.690
It will come, closer

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.690
Now

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.690
If there’s an instance that we
become separated,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.690
don’t trust him if he looks
like your teammate.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.990
Just like now there’s a possibility

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.690
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.690
Yeah.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.260
So what do we do?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.030
We’ll decide on a password.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.400
Password?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.140
I’ll only say it once so listen closely.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.010
You ask Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.410
And the answer is this:

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.750
“It is a chance to sneak up where a large
 number of enemies are making a scene.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.550
“The quiet place has
no secret hideout.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.790
“It is important for
a Shinobi to know the right time.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.690
“The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard.”

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.960
That’s it.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.530
H-Huge!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.700
T-Tail!

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.110
You want our Earth Scroll, don’t you?

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.090
Well, let's begin...

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.130
the battle for the Scrolls.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.570
Life or death!

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.310
If this creature doesn’t want
to spit me out …

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.980
I’ll make it to do so at any cost!

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.330
I can’t move!

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.140
I wanted you to entertain me more.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.940
It’s too bad.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.680
Move!

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.320
He wiped out the fear with pain.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.530
As expected,
he’s not the average prey.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.900
Don’t come near me!

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.480
Don’t lower your guard,
not even for a moment…

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.330
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.230
before a predator!

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.680
Sorry Sasuke.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.090
Naruto!

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.600
The password… I forgot it!

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.700
Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.680
The password... I forgot it!

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.980
That’s all right, Naruto!

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.280
Awesome!

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:42.720
Naruto!

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.320
I know you tried to be cool and
intended to rescue us, but…

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.390
Don’t put your nose in this!

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.460
Escape!

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.760
This thing…
She’s on a far different level!

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.700
Seems like you brought that
giant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.470
No matter how you look,
she looks like a snake…

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.680
I get it, it was the handiwork
of this woman.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.590
The situation has never gotten any better
with him showing up for the rescue.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.360
But what should I do…?

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.200
Hey hey hey! Evidently you’ve been
bullying the weakling!

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.270
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki is here,

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.440
I’m going to wipe the floor with you!

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.440
Darn it! If it continues like this,
all three of us are done for!

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.350
What should I do?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.720
Sasuke...

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.100
It’s no good.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.430
This is the only way.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.670
Wait.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.670
Hmm?

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.340
– Huh?! 					– Huh?

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.680
If it’s the scroll you want,
I’ll give it to you.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.590
I’m asking you.
Just take this and go.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.020
Huh?!

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.490
What?!

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.730
Hey, Sasuke!
What are you doing?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.630
Why are you giving
our scroll to the enemy?

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.430
You, shut up!

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.670
What …?!

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.670
I see… 					You’re sensible.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.680
The only thing the “prey” can
hope for from the “predator” is

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.250
presenting other food and
pray you would be spared, isn’t it?

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.500
Take it.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.630
Wha--?!

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.570
You! Don’t interfere with this!

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.680
Don’t you understand this situation?!

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.690
What're you doing all of a sudden?!

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.540
As for me,
 I don’t remember the password…

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.670
So I got no way to make sure.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.110
But you, you’re an imposter
Sasuke,  aren’t you?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.250
Naruto!

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.980
W-What are you trying to start?!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.650
You loser! 					I’m the real me!

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.890
Liar.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:16.070
This, this stupid coward is... absolutely...
not the Sasuke I know!

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.440
I don’t know how strong she is but,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.640
how can you be sure that she’ll let us
go if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.180
You’re the one who choked and
doesn’t understand this situation!

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.350
Naruto.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.190
That’s correct.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.700
The Scroll.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.440
I could just kill you
and seize it.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.640
Don’t mess with me!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.480
Run, Naruto! Stop it!

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.310
Darn it!

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.180
I’ve lost confidence in you, Sasuke!

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.850
Summoning Jutsu!

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.130
Naruto!

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.480
There are three corpses.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.980
This is some kind of Ninja Art,
isn’t it… ?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.450
This is bad.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.660
We have a problem,
from the get go.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.230
I’ll be darned.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.540
Inform Anko,
the Proctor of the second test.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.440
Yes, sir!

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.650
If you’re going to have dumplings,
you’ve got to have sweet red bean soup.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.450
Okay...
Once I’ve eaten this,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.990
I should break through and
go wait at the tower for the kids.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.700
With this program, the quick kids
should clear it soon.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.100
The Leaf Village mark, perfect!

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.640
We have a problem, Ms. Anko!

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.880
Huh? What, so suddenly?

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.810
Corpses! Three of them!

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.520
Moreover, they’re strange.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.650
Anyway, please come!

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:54.590
Strange?

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.200
I checked their possessions
and identification,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.670
Ninjas from Grass Village
registered in the Chunin Exam, but…

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.810
As you can see...

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.680
They have no faces.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.820
Yes.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.690
They’re smooth and flat,
like they melted away.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:31.530
Without a doubt...

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.700
This Jutsu is...

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:37.600
that man’s...

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.040
Why is he at this test…?

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.630
Show me the ID photos of
these three Grass Village Ninjas.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.030
It’s on their applications.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.140
Yes!

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.670
So this one’s face was robbed.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.480
Then, at that time it was already…

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.980
I’ll return… the Kunai knife.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.490
Thank you for your trouble.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.530
We’re in big trouble.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.390
Huh?!

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.030
Communicate this to
Lord Hokage right away!

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.230
Make a call for action to
the Anbu Black Ops

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.200
to assemble more than two squads
to the Forest of Death!

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.340
Starting now,
I’m going to follow these guys!

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.210
Got it?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:48.910
Yes!

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.340
That guy…

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.380
That guy... has come to Leaf Village!

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.930
Cute.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.070
You’re such a cute prey.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.240
Naruto!

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.670
Narutooo!

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.650
Well, polish him off.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.940
Shove it!

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.150
This brat! Can’t be…

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.760
Naruto… He’s lost control…

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.100
But... that Naruto,
why is he so strong?!

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.690
Those eyes...

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.460
There’s no mistake.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.990
That’s... Naruto?!

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.700
This just got interesting.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.030
Next is...

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.670
Sasuke.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.710
Now what’s your move?!

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.150
Sasuke!

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.090
I have to hurry.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.560
I get this...

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.670
bad feeling.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.390
Hey.  Are you hurt?

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.700
Scaredy cat?!

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.670
Naruto!

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.310
Hey!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.480
Are you hurt...

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.350
Scaredy cat?

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:24.690
Sasuke!

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:35.300
This stupid coward is absolutely
not the Sasuke I know!

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.410
Huh?!

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:48.810
Darn it! 					Let me go!

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.580
You stupid snake!

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.550
To think that the
nine-tailed brat lived…

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.200
When you get excited, a bit
of the nine-tail’s power trickles out…

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.240
You’ve grown up interesting.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.440
Look…

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.140
The Seal is appearing on
your skin like a tattoo.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.320
Five-Pronged…Sealing!

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.930
Sasuke! Help Naruto!

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.680
Twelve years since the seal…

00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.320
Naruto’s Chakras and the nine-tail’s
Chakras are beginning to act in synch…

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:09.060
But  now... you’re in the way.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.700
He’s gonna fall as it is!

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.300
Naruto!

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.540
What happened Sasuke?!

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.810
Sasuke…

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.860
Naruto’s certainly different
from you, Sasuke.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.690
He’s a klutz and
kind of gets in the way.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.060
But he’s not in the least a coward!

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.700
Right? 					lsn’t that right?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.540
You foolish little brother.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.880
If you want to kill me,
resent me, hate me and…

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.820
continue to live your ugly life.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.690
Flee.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.720
Flee and hang on to your life.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.960
No!

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.610
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…
his blood has begun to stir…

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.610
Sasuke!

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.550
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:24.260
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:32.540
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:42.010
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:50.390
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:57.330
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.200
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.730
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:13.680
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.150
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.690
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.520
Just sing.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.760
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.100
The two are one

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.570
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.080
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.120
I'm an avenger.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.720
To defeat my brother,
today I have to survive!

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.530
But how can a person who won't risk
his life in a situation like this

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.390
beat my brother?

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.560
Calm down, you should be able to see.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.930
There should be some way
to intercept her movements.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.670

Dragon-Flame Jutsu!"
