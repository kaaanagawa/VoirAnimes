00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.950
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.860
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.160
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.320
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.490
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.030
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.910
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.030
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.200
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.870
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:28.860
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.450
But thank goodness
your injury wasn’t serious.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.990
Naruto was relieved, too…

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.530
The rumors were true…

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.200
That the survivor of the Village’s
honorable Uchiha Clan

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.780
was the most good-for-nothing kid…

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.780
Sasuke, you must be hungry.
ls there something you want to eat?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.910
I’ll go buy something for you.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.870
The Battle Begins:
Naruto vs. Sasuke

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.740
To be honest,
I really don’t understand.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.160
It seems there were opinions that,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.570
with the final exam being suspended,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.570
no one should pass
this time around.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.620
But I hear the late Third Hokage
highly praised your match.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.990
It seems he intended to recommend you
for Chunin.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.780
The lords of other lands
who observed the fight

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.910
and the proctors were of
the same opinion as well…

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.950
In that case, it’s not in my place
to say this or that about it.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.860
From now on,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.240
strive to perform in a manner
that is worthy of that headband…

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.410
Congratulations!
As of today, you’re a Chunin!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.860
– Wow… 					– Wow!

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.200
Even you who’s never motivated
look respectable.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.700
It doesn’t suit you.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.870
Don’t laugh, I say…

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.860
For the time being,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.320
let’s have a toast to celebrate
Shikamaru’s promotion to Chunin!

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.620
Let’s eat!

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.820
Oh! Choji!

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.620
Don’t eat the meat before the toast!

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.990
But, it’d be a waste if it got burned, so…

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.700
There’s a lot of meat. Eat up!

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.990
All right!

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.530
Right now,
I have no interest in you…

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.740
Your target is Naruto, after all.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.200
You’ll end up in the hospital again, Choji.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.860
Don’t you know how to savor the taste?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200
Never mind!

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.860
Even if I eat a lot,
I know how to savor properly.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.860
Hey! Choji, that’s the last piece of meat
that I’ve been grilling!

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.490
The last bite!

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.070
This is the conclusion and

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.740
will become the meat with
the greatest value that should be savored!

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.660
I won’t hand over
this last bite to anyone!

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.860
What’re you acting cool for,
you idiot?!

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.490
Everyone makes fun of you
because you’re like this!

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.280
– You’re just a fa--
– Ino!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.240
That’s a taboo word!

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.910
But really, Choji…

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.280
A meal isn’t a battle.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.450
Relax at a time like this at least.
What a pain.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.860
Vulgar... Dirty-mouthed…
Too lazy…

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.030
I wonder if these guys
will be okay from here.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.860
In particular…

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.070
Choji. With you it’s nothing but food.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.240
Do a little training sometime!

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.030
Choji…

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.530
You’re lucky that your mind
doesn’t restrict what you eat…

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.620
I’ve got it rough with a diet.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.860
Why do you have to diet, Ino?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:03.910
Girls want to be seen as cute as possible
by the one they like!

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.320
But that person might not always
like a thin person.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.240
In the first place,
most boys don’t like fa--

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.530
Not that… They like thin girls.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.860
And, vice-versa.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.370
You should be a little more conscious
of your body, Choji.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.740
You won’t be popular.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.860
Heh… She doesn’t get it.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.870
Men don’t like thin women
as much as women think.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.570
More likely men who like chubby women
are the most common.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.570
And, vice-versa…I’d say.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.120
I bet she’d be twice as popular

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.120
if she were to gain a little more weight
instead of dieting.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.160
You sure are a funny guy, Shikamaru.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.870
And you’re smart, too.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.570
Hmm?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.570
I know it in my heart…

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.700
You’re much more awesome
than the likes of Sasuke or Neji.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.870
Well, I’ve never even thought about that.
I’m me, so…

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.120
But you’re the only one
who became a Chunin

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.570
in the Chunin Exam this time…

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.120
But you might be better
at fighting, right?

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.120
I might’ve given up if
I’d gotten into one with you.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.860
But earlier,
Sensei told me that all I do is eat

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.410
and that I’m not progressing…

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.660
I’m me, I tell you. And you’re you.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.990
It’s stupid talking about how which is.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.160
Well, don’t worry too much
about what Asuma says…

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.860
You should live naturally
and take things easy.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.620
See you later! I’m going home.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.570
My dad’s starting to say
some troublesome thing

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.370
like he’s going to teach me
a new Jutsu or something.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.860
Shikamaru.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:10.620
Hmm?

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:15.240
What?

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.370
Good luck with your training.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.370
Yeah.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.240
You’re a good guy…Choji.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.620
Hey, Sakura!

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.860
Naruto!

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.370
The time is right…

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.780
Head for the Leaf Village, now!

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.160
I see… You’ve made up your mind, huh?

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.070
Yes!

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.280
I’m carrying out fitness training
to get ready for the surgery.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.620
I want to return as soon as
I can after the surgery, so…

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.120
Oww!

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.860
Ow-ow…

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.780
Lee…

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.370
Yes?! What is it?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.990
You won’t die
if you give up being a Shinobi.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.950
Why are you so fixated
on being a Shinobi?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.950
My everything is proving that
even I can become a fine Ninja…

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.530
You might die. Even if you succeed…

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.410
Even so…

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.410
I promise you!

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.780
That’s my dream, so…

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.370
Why…do you snap this much
at the mention of Hokage’s name?

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.280
Unlike you…

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.620
I will be the heir to the name
of Hokage, no matter what!

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.370
Because, Hokage is my dream!

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.410
In this village, promising children
are being brought up.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.200
Sarutobi Sensei… Sure enough,
you were a wonderful Hokage.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.860
The surgery is in the afternoon.
Get ready!

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.740
Let’s go, Lee! Are you prepared?!

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.700
Yes!

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.070
I got some apples…
You like them, right?

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.450
Here, doesn’t it look good?

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.990
Huh…? I wonder where I put the knife…

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.860
It’s right in front of you, believe it.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.820
It’s so lame, you getting all scatterbrained
just because you’re in front of Sasuke.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.990
I’d rather hear lame
from anyone but you…

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.990
Naruto…

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.030
U-zu-ma-ki!

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.660
Naruto 2K Barrage!

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.030
Knock it off already!

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.860
Summoning Jutsu!

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.860
I will…protect Sakura!

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.620
I-I give up, believe it…

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.280
Sasuke… Thank you.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.660
You rescued me from
the Sand Ninja, right?

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.740
No...

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.860
The person who rescued you…
was Naruto.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.280
You are weak.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.530
Why are you weak…?

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.620
It’s because you don’t have enough…

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.120
...hate.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.570
Good. I peeled it nicely.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.950
I’ll cut it to make it easy to eat, and…

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.860
Here, Sasuke.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.950
Ow! What happened?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.910
S-Sasuke?

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.820
Huh? What’s going on?

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.990
Wh-What?

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.860
Y-You don’t have to glare
at me like that.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:04.860
Hey, Naruto…

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:06.570
Wh-What is it?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.410
Fight me… Right now!

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.860
What?! Here you are,
just treated by Old Lady Tsunade.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.320
What’re you saying?

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.860
Just fight!

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.370
Sasuke…

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.700
You think you saved me?

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.280
I don’t care if she’s the Fifth Hokage
or whatever, but…

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.860
she should’ve just minded
her own business!

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.240
What?!

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.660
You said you wanted to fight me, right?

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.950
I’m saying let’s do it now!

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.030
Or have you chickened out?

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.450
S-Sasuke. Hey…
What’s going on?!

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.780
Naruto, you say something too!

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.530
What’s this all of a sudden?

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.070
This is perfect, believe it!

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:58.200
I was just thinking
I wanted to fight you!

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.660
S-Stop it, the both of you… Okay?

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.570
Come with me!

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.910
What’s…this feeling?
My lower belly feels tight…

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.030
I want to fight you, too.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.860
And… I feel a thrill.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.530
What’s so funny?

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.860
Nothing’s funny, believe it!
I’m happy!

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.450
When I think
I can finally beat you here!

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:31.410
Abducting Naruto is the No.1 priority
of our organization, Akatsuki.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.070
What did you say?
Don’t talk foolish, you failure!

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.990
I’m not going to be
a failure forever!

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.700
Right now,
I have no interest in you…

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:54.490
You… A loser like you better
not act all high and mighty!

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.160
Hah! It’s unlike you to lose
your cool and raise a fuss.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.530
So uncharacteristic.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:04.570
It couldn’t be that you picked a fight
and then got scared, could it, Sasuke?

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.160
Just bring it, now!

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.570
Put on your headband before that!
I’ll wait.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.820
I don’t need such a thing…

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.490
Just do it!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.820
You wouldn’t even be able…
to put one knick on my forehead!

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.320
You’re wrong!

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.370
I’m saying this is a testament to fighting
on equal terms as a Leaf Shinobi!

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.740
And I’m saying stuff like that
is acting high and mighty!

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.280
Do you think that we’re equal?!

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:39.860
Yeah, I do! I’ve never once
thought that I’m inferior to you!

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.990
You’re an eyesore!

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.870
That’s because you remain weak!
Little Sasuke!

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.870
Naruto!

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.860
Sasuke!

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.160
Don’t be getting carried away!

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.910
Naruto…

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.860
Enough already, believe it!

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.200
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.740
U-zu-ma-ki!

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.490
Naruto Barrage!

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:19.860
The Tiger Seal!

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.490
Fire Style! Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.030
N-Naruto!

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.490
Wh-What is that Jutsu?!

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:55.860
Damn it!

00:20:58.780 --> 00:20:59.860
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.860
S-Stop…

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.780
I’ll win no matter what!

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.860
Don’t flatter yourself!

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.320
Stop it, both of you…

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.450
Stop it!

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:37.860
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.530
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.820
Look like a mountain

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:58.950
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:04.780
The remnants of a person crying

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.740
Look like a mountain

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.410
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:17.240
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.570
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.820
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:38.910
Look like a mountain

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.160
Look like a mountain

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.860
Look like a mountain

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.990
Look like a mountain

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.780
After becoming a Three-Man Squad,
though we had fights,

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.570
we carried out our missions together.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.280
And yet, both Sasuke and Naruto
have steadily gone on ahead

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.820
and only I've been left behind.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:14.160
Say, Sasuke, I feel you at a distance
even though you're this close.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.410
No matter what,
I can't see you, Sasuke.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.860

 "Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds"
