WEBVTT

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.410
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.910
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.540
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.120
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.540
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.540
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.200
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.040
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.330
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.700
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.000
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.580
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.160
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.660
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.290
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.870
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.580
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.000
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.370
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.200
My body movements
have finally returned…

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.620
Blood…

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.870
Lady Tsunade!

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.750
Say! Say! What’s happening?!

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.790
Why’s Kabuto fighting
with Old Lady Tsunade?!

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.040
Take a good look at the headband!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.540
He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.740
Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.740
That man is Orochimaru…

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.410
Shizune, you take care of
the guy with the glasses…

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.450
I’ll take care of Orochimaru.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.330
Before that, I’d like to have Tsunade
do something about this body.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.410
The effects of that drug
might still last for awhile…

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.790
There’s nothing that
I can do about it.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.830
What? Really?

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.660
Geez. I guess it can’t be helped.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.580
I have no choice
but to fight in this condition.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.450
Tsunade… Rest your body
with Recovery Ninjutsu.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.660
Then… What about me, me?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.000
You guard Tsunade together
with that pig.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.450
What?! I want to fight, too.
Even I can--

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.620
No, you won’t!

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.740
Like that four-eyed kid said, right?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.790
You’re on a different level.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.790
The opponent is a Sannin like myself,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.790
and the man who killed
the Third Hokage.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.450
An eye for an eye…
I’m the only one who can fight him.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.620
And that four-eyed guy possesses
the same level of power as Kakashi.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.320
Okay.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.160
Then… Shadow Clo--

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.040
Hold it!

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.740
Don’t use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
lt’d be utterly pointless.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.740
What?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.000
It wouldn’t even become
much of a diversion…

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.790
It’d be a waste of Chakra…

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.740
with them as opponents.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.740
Now then, let’s get this thing started.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.500
– Summoning Jutsu.
– Summoning Jutsu.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.740
Hi.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.250
– Huh?! 					– What is this?!

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.950
– Wha--?!
– What the heck’s going on?!

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.740
Long time no see.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.500
On account of the drug,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.500
Master Jiraiya still can’t build up
Chakra very well.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.740
It looks like your stupid
still hasn’t healed, eh, Jiraiya.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.740
That’s too much even for you
with no ability.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.740
It seems Tsunade got you
with something.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.950
A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.160
so perhaps she was thinking ahead
and drugged him

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.740
with something that
would contain his power.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.740
To think she’d make
a sacrifice of Jiraiya…

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.040
Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.740
To think I’d already have
my handicap spotted.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.040
You are such
a disgraceful guy as always…

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.740
Dang it. It kind of ticks me off
when the Pervy Sage is mocked.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.830
Summoning…Jutsu!

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.500
The Nine-Tailed Fox kid
from the Chunin Exam.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.410
I wonder if I should’ve killed him then,
after all.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.740
For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.120
I acknowledged his achievement…
and let him slide by.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.870
But the only ones who can break
a Five-Pronged Spell

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.740
are the Sannin members
and the Third Hokage.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.500
Which means Jiraiya may have
already taught it to Naruto.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.950
Perhaps.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.620
If he’s able to control
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s power…

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.740
Oh…

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.740
Th-This is…

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.790
It doesn’t quite look to be so.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.000
He isn’t endowed with Shinobi ability
to begin with, so…

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.080
Why?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.620
He’s still got a long way to go,
sure enough.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.740
Why?!

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.660
Hello.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.250
Hey, Gamatatsu.
Why did you come out?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.910
Oh, Brother Gamakichi.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.950
It’s the first time I’ve been Summoned.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.200
I-I wonder if I can do my best?

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.540
Idiot. Get some snacks
or something and hide.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.500
What? I can get snacks?
Goody-goody.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.750
Here I go.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.580
I’ll take Jiraiya.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.740
I leave the rest to you.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.740
It’s unfortunate…

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.830
Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,
one of the Sannin.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.740
Naruto!

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.290
Your opponent is me.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.740
Earth Style! Dark Swamp!

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:36.080
Dang it. I can’t completely sink them
with such a puny swamp.

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.910
The drug is still working.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.790
But…with this, the snakes can’t move.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.740
Ninja Art! Poison Fog!

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.450
I’ll be up a creek if
I take even one breath.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.740
My leg tendons…!

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.910
I won’t be eaten twice…!
No way!

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.740
Here I go.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.290
Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.330
Dang it…The Jutsu isn’t working well.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.540
Even if we both have handicaps,
you won’t one-up me…

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.830
Give up now.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.540
It’s unfortunate…

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.740
Here I had respected you
as a fellow Medical Ninja.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.330
Stop. Stay back!

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.910
Please hang on, Lady Tsunade…

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:00.200
The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaru
is also called, will cry.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.620
My body’s heavy.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.740
To think you who were
once called the village madness

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.580
would ferry around such a kid
and struggle tirelessly for the village.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.250
You’ve really fallen, haven’t you?

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.410
I have a keen eye to discern ability.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:33.450
And that kid…is mediocrity in my eyes.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.750
It’s precisely for this reason…
that I don’t need the Uchiha kid.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.370
It’s no fun raising a genius
who’s good from the start.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.450
So you can’t leave him alone

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.700
because it’s like you’re looking
at your old self?

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:59.080
That kid can’t beat Uchiha who inherited
the inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.790
And that’s because Naruto
doesn’t possess the Sharingan.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.950
Shinobi ability is about whether

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.910
one can use and master
all the Jutsu of the world.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.740
Ninja refers to one
who can use Ninjutsu.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.250
Shinobi ability is no such thing.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.330
You still don’t get it?

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.410
A Ninja…is one who endures.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.740
It’s a difference of opinion, huh.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.740
I’ll teach you one thing.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.330
What’s most important for Shinobi ability…

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.250
isn’t the number of Jutsu
one possesses.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.910
What’s important is…

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.950
The mettle…

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.740
not to give up.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.740
Enough already…you jerk!

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.740
The mettle to never give up…

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.200
He possesses that.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.000
Heh. I don’t know what Jutsu you learned,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.740
but you can’t hit me with
such a large motion.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.330
No good.

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.040
It won’t easily hit with
a moving opponent.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.830
Owwee!

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.620
And the Chakra isn’t
completely held, yet…

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.410
It seems you got a cracked thigh bone
in your left leg

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:22.740
from the battle with the snake.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.740
Well, you can still move if
it’s just the bone.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.040
But it’s impossible now…

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.290
The lateral vastus muscle
in your right leg is totally cut off.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.040
What should I do…?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.830
That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.080
If even one arm is taken out, it’s over.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.120
Are you scared of me?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.500
Do you want to run away from here?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.750
Naruto, as I recall,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.200
you whooped it up like this
during the first Chunin Exam.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.410
Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away!

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.000
"Don’t mess with me. I won’t run away."

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.160
"I’ll take it. Even if I’m a Genin for life…"

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.830
"I’ll become the Hokage at any cost,
so it’s okay with me."

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.740
"I’m not scared."

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.450
Can you…
whoop it up in the same way now?

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.160
Unlike you…

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.740
I will be the heir to the Hokage name
no matter what!

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.660
– Hokage is my dream!
– Hokage is my dream!

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.410
You’re not a kid anymore,
so you should stop whooping it up…

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.200
Depending on the situation,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.410
when you want to give up and run away,
you should run away.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.450
Oh my… What’s with that look?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.740
You’ll die! If you die,
there are no dreams or anything…

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.700
Do you want to die?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.700
You’re still a Genin,
so you should run away on the battlefield.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.120
Don’t tell a man to run away.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.830
Kids think that everything is easy.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.370
That’s why they talk about foolish dreams
like nothing at all.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.740
That’s why they can’t give up.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.370
Jiraiya, was it you
who taught him that Rasengan?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.250
Are you acting like a teacher by teaching
a Jutsu that can’t be learned?

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.290
Don’t give him false hopes.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:21.290
That’s why a moony kid starts joking
that he’ll become the Hokage!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.740
They chase after foolish dreams…
and then die.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.740
If I have three days,
I’ll master that Jutsu.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.740
Then let's make a bet.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.790
Bastard!

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.410
As for me… I stand by my words.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.040
That’s…my Way of Ninja!

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.740
A bet?

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.790
I’ll give you one week.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.750
If you can master that Jutsu,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.000
I’ll acknowledge that
you’ll be able to become the Hokage…

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.410
and give you this necklace.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.660
You should’ve just
stayed out of this…

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.330
Why?

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.700
Why?!

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.450
Old Lady Tsunade…

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.660
You’re still going to get up?

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:13.950
Just like our wager

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.040
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.950
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.750
Shadow Clone won’t do anything now.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.740
Enough… Don’t protect me, Naruto.
Stop it!

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.040
I told you that you’d die
if you were obstinate like that, right?

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.080
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.080
Just get out of the way. Run away.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.700
Humph… It’s okay.

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:00.950
I…

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.740
I absolutely will not die…

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.450
until I become the Hokage!

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.290
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.290
It’s the same Chakra movement
as before.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.740
No, this is…different.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:44.580
I see.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.910
In order to gain a hand
for suppressing Chakra,

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.500
the Shadow Clone…

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.290
Compress Chakra and…

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.830
hold it completely.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.950
Wha--?!

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.740
I-It can’t be.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:04.870
Rasengan!

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:23.740
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.040
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.200
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.830
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.580
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:48.330
That hold us together

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:57.950
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.740
you say laughingly

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.740
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:11.660
Like a comet,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.740
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:24.830
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:35.290
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:44.120
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.200
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.580
I never forget my ideal…

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.950
to develop the Village Hidden in the Leaf
and protect its people.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.740
The Hokages have sacrificed
their lives for that dream.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.790
And now,
I also will put my life on the line.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.410
From this moment,
I am the Fifth Hokage!

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.740
Next time: "The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!"
