WEBVTT

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.690
C'mon!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.630
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.310
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.980
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
For no single one,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.460
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.730
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.370
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.340
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.810
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.890
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.590
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.600
Rockin' my heart

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.500
Naruto and others are
out there fighting!

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.030
We should be too!

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.470
The Weapon Known 					as Shinobi

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.740
Old man!

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.040
Old Man Giichi!

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.650
Please open up!

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.750
Let's go to the bridge!

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.580
If we all do it together,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.950
we can beat Gatô and
his men this time!

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.590
Inari…

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.130
I made up my mind not
to fight anymore.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.670
Even your father…

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.100
The man we called a hero…

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.470
He's not with us anymore.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.080
If we were to fight,
many lives would be lost.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.580
I don't want lose something that's
special to me anymore.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.060
No one wants to regret again.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.270
I…

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.800
I don't want to regret again, either.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.870
That's why we must fight!

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.580
A man should live
his life without regrets.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.120
I love Mommy and Grampa.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.350
And you too, Old Man Giichi!

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.420
I love all the people here!

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.660
I finally realized…

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.670
Nothing is accomplished if
I just cry all the time!

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.040
I finally got it!

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.090
Inari…has grown into
a fine man.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.630
Will you just let Inari go
there by himself?

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.040
Open up!

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.910
Hey!

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.580
I'm asking you to fight with me!

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.380
Old man! Please listen to me!

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.590
Why…

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.960
Why won't anyone open
the door to me?

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.930
You are strong!

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.040
Naruto…

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.490
Zabuza.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.590
You were too full of yourself.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.600
You're too ambitious for your own good.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.970
You assassinated the Mizukage,
but failed to pull off a coup.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.970
You left the service with
few men under you,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.040
and became a Rogue Ninja.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.910
Soon after, your name reached
our Hidden Leaf Village.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.950
You needed to raise funds
to strike back.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.720
And you needed to hide

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.790
from the Tracking Unit's
pursuit and retaliation.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.390
Isn't that about the reason why

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.590
you hired yourself out
to scum like Gatô?

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.730
Zabuza…

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.900
Do you really believe I've managed
to survive with just Sharingan?

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.570
Here's something I didn't copy,
a technique of my own…

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.580
to enlighten you!

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.260
Lightning Blade!

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.660
What the…?!

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.000
His hand is…
visibly overflowing with Chakra!

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.930
You are too dangerous.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.570
Tazuna, the man you are trying
to assassinate,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.170
is the symbol of courage
in this land!

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.580
The bridge he is building
is the hope of this land!

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.180
And your ambitions will
sacrifice countless lives.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.450
That isn't how
a Shinobi is supposed to behave.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.190
Who cares?

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.590
I have always fought for
my own ideals.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.160
And that will never ever change!

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.570
I'll say it again.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.570
Huh?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.470
Give up.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.580
Your future is…death!

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.590
Naruto…

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.590
I want you to kill me.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.630
Please, make it quick.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.870
What are you hesitating for?

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.380
I just don't get it!

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.480
The only reason you are allowed
to live is because you stay strong?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.950
There must be something other
than just fighting…

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.290
There must be some other way

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.720
for you to make
the others accept you!

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.260
Remember when we met at the forest?
Do you know what I thought?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.600
That you and I are much alike.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.200
I'm sure you can relate to me.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.410
I apologize for dirtying
your hands with my blood.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.610
Is that it?

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.910
Is there really no other way?

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:26.020
No.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.090
If only…we had met under
different circumstances,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.990
we could've been friends.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.670
Please…promise you will
grasp your dream.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.740
He too…

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.240
Sasuke also had dreams of his own!

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.290
Thank you…
You will become stronger.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.130
Hmm…

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.100
The super thick fog
has finally begun to clear.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.930
There are two over there!

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.470
They are facing off each other.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.330
Huh?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.470
I can't see well…

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.170
Which one is Kakashi Sensei…

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.580
One moved!

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.910
Huh?

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.060
Forgive me, Naruto…

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.500
I cannot die yet!

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.590
Is this the end…?

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.600
What was that?

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.030
Zabuza…

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.700
Did you say my future
was death?

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.610
You're off the mark again, Kakashi!

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.550
No…

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.080
You're not to go to the bridge alone!

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.620
I went all over the town,
but no one wants to come.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.590
I have no choice!

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:56.590
But…

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:11.140
Wait! 					You're just a child!

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.580
I may be a child, but I already
know what it means to fight.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.350
Because I'm my father's son!

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.260
My dear…

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.100
Wait a moment, Inari!

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.710
Where did he go…?

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.750
I didn't notice,
but the fog is starting to lift…

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.020
Huh? Is he over there?

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.920
Huh?!

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.470
What the heck is going on here?!

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.110
Isn't that the masked boy?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.920
I didn't expect him to jump in
to save Zabuza…

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.730
The boy…is already dead.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.600
You did great, Haku.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.970
Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.580
He intends to slash me
along with the boy?!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.410
That was really a great find I made!

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.580
Even in his final moment,

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.350
he gave me such
a perfect opportunity!

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.600
Haku, bad news.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.900
I have to leave
Land of Water as of tonight.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.940
However, I'll return
to this land someday.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.880
I will rule over this land.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.580
To do that,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.150
what I need isn't consolation,
encouragement or empty words.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.720
What I really need is…

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.220
I already know.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.690
You have nothing to fear.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.390
I am your weapon, Zabuza.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.830
Keep me by you as a mere tool
that heeds your every word.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.430
You're a good boy!

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.390
Haku died and you were
able to move, huh?

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.420
I won't forgive you!

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.420
Naruto!

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.760
You just stay there and watch!

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.580
This is...

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.350
my battle!

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.490
Naruto…

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.330
Naruto!
lt's good to see you!

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:55.170
Sakura…

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.570
Where's Sasuke?

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.610
Naruto! 					Where is Sasuke?

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.520
Sakura…

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.090
Kakashi!

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.390
You have no time to take
your eyes off me!

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.600
Why don't I go with you?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.030
That way, you won't be going
against your Sensei's word.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.000
Right…

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.520
Sasuke…

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.560
Huh?!

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:25.890
He's cold.

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.390
This isn't Genjutsu, is it?

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.630
Don't mind me.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.000
This isn't the time to
hold back your emotions…

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:54.020
I-I always got perfect scores
at the Ninja Academy…

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.590
Huh?

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.930
I memorized all the
hundreds of Shinobi rules.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.600
All the tests were a breeze.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.770
Until one day,
this question came up…

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.170
State Rule ♪ 25 of
the Ways of the Shinobi…

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.580
As always, I simply wrote down
the answer without batting an eye.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.050
"A Shinobi must never
show his true feelings

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.920
under any circumstances,
no matter what…

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.890
The mission always comes first.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.400
A Ninja must have the strength
of character never to shed any tears…"

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.610
Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.480
That is so unbearably painful…

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.280
Sasuke…

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.580
Why…? 					Why can't I keep up?

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.020
Darn you!

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.370
Why you…!

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.020
You can't possibly defeat me
the way you are now.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.590
What was that?

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.160
You still don't know…
What true strength means!

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.530
Let's see how things are going…

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.340
Goodbye, Demon!

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.570
Both your arms have
now been disabled.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.570
You can't even weave a sign.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:08.850
Huh?

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.220
Oh!
You really got it this time.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.990
You disappoint me, Zabuza.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.470
Huh?! You!

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.770
What the heck
are you doing?!

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.740
Don't you have anything
to say, Zabuza?!

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.540
He was your comrade, right?!

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.480
You were always,
always together, weren't you?

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.150
He really liked you, you know!

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.580
You really don't feel anything?!

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:31.550
