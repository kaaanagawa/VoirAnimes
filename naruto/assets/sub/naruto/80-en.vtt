WEBVTT

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.750
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.250
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.460
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.790
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.790
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.550
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.380
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.670
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.800
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.340
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.790
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.500
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.630
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.210
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.500
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.710
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.050
The Third Hokage, Forever…

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.250
Sarutobi…

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.630
At the very least this sword…

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.500
It was a fitting end for somebody like you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.710
who has mastered
the Way of the Shinobi.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.380
It feels like my arms are burning…

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.880
Master Orochimaru!

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.300
This is where we call off our plan.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.210
Release the Barrier.
We’ll head back.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.340
– Yes! 					– Yes!

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.630
– Release! 					– Release!

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.710
The Barrier…!

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.710
It’s released!

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.790
Where is Lord Hokage?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.750
Let’s go!

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.590
We won’t let you get away!

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.880
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550
An adhesive type of string
filled with Chakra…?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.790
Kakashi! They’re on the move!
Do we go after them?

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.250
No, wait, Guy.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:12.550
That’s right…

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.790
If you make a move without
any data on the situation up there,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800
you will get caught in
the enemy’s trap.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.420
I’m totally aware of that.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.420
But regardless of whether
there is a trap or not,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.790
we can’t let the enemy get away
at a time like this!

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.050
That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.960
So…are you just going to watch?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.500
Kabuto?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.790
So you did know, after all.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.790
So…what are we going to do?

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.590
It’s about time that
we made a retreat.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.790
You’re going to run away
from me again?

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.460
Right now…

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.790
if we show our cards,
they’re most likely going to be copied.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.340
Then again,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.210
it doesn't seem like you’ve completely
mastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.630
Well then…

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.840
Temari…

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.460
Kankuro!

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.920
I’m leaving Sakura with you.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.340
H-Hey!

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.090
Why is…this guy so strong?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.000
My existence will not disappear…

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.790
I will not disappear!
I cannot disappear!

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.170
I told you not to talk to that guy!

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.630
Let’s go.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.130
Oh, there! That’s him…

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.750
Go away!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.590
Monster! Monster! Monster…!

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.790
You monster! Die!

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.750
That’s him… Don’t get involved, fool!

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.500
Don’t look at him!

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.790
Go away!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.500
To them, I’m just a relic of the past
who they want to see disappear.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.630
So what did I have in this life,
why did I keep living?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.790
And that time, I thought of myself that I…
no, that is what I had to think.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.380
And then knew that
it was the most painful thing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.790
That I… that my existence didn’t matter
to anyone else in the world.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.790
D-Don’t come any closer!

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:49.460
The pain of…being all alone…
really is unbearable, isn’t it?

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.630
The way you feel…

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.590
I don’t know why,
but I completely understand that it hurts.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.710
But I’ve met people who are
very important to me now.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.670
I won’t allow those important people…
to get hurt!

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:20.790
If not, I will stop you even if
that means…that I have to kill you!

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.300
Why…?

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.790
How is it that you can fight so much
for other people?

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.550
They saved me from the hell
of being all alone.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.380
They accepted me for who I was.

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.000
That’s why…they are important to me!

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.800
Love is a heart that desires to serve
a precious person who is close to oneself,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.710
to love and watch over that person…

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.790
Love…

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.090
That is why he is so strong?

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.050
That’s enough, Naruto…

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.090
Sakura is okay.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.590
This guy’s Chakra must
have been depleted as well…

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.790
Sakura’s sand crumbled
a long time ago.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.380
Oh, I see…

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.790
I’ve had enough… Stop here.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.800
Gaara?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.880
I’ve never seen Gaara in such
a weakened state before…

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.550
All right.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.000
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.250
LOVE
							One of these days, even I…

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.880
Temari… Kankuro…

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.170
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.170
Sorry…

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.800
D-Don’t worry about it…

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.340
Rain…

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.000
The sky has started to weep as well…

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.300
We will begin the memorial service

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.790
for the Third Hokage,
who lost his life in this battle,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.550
as well as the other victims
of this battle.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.790
It’s started…

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.920
In the end,
all we could do was just watch…

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.790
Why?

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.590
Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800
Why…?

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.380
It’s already been a year…

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.250
It’s not easy to laugh
hiding your sadness.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.340
I heard from your teacher that
you’re the center of laughter…

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.840
I’m not sad at all!

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.960
It’s a very honorable thing for
a Shinobi to die doing their duty!

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.250
My dad and mom sacrificed their lives

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.460
to protect this village
from the Demon Fox…

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.840
They’re heroes!

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:24.750
I am the child of the heroes!
I’m not sad to be alone.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.550
And besides, these are tears of joy.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.790
It’s all right.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.790
I know that you’re curled up
holding your knees by yourself.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.210
But you’re not alone…

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.000
Huh?

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.460
The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village
have the will of fire…

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.130
Will of fire…?

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.130
It’s the strong will to protect
the Leaf Village.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:02.710
As long as they have this will of fire,
everybody in this village are all family.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.130
Iruka… I wonder if you have it?

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.460
Yeah…

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.300
For Hayate…?

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.090
The Third Hokage’s funeral
has already started. Make it quick.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.670
You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito…?

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.000
If you’re always thinking of
an excuse for your tardiness,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.710
you should just come earlier.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.300
I do…from early in the morning.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.460
It’s just that,
whenever I come here

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.670
I just want to punish myself
for being such a fool in the past.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.790
Humph…

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.050
Shinobi, no matter what kind
of situation they are in,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.380
cannot show their emotion.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.340
You must always prioritize your mission,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.250
and never shed a tear in
any kind of situation…

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.790
Iruka Sensei…

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:01.670
Hmm?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.500
Why do people risk their own lives
for other people?

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.300
When one person dies…

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.170
their past, their present life, and their future
disappear along with them.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.340
Many people die doing their duty
and fighting in battle…

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.550
And shockingly easily, too.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.170
Hayate was one of them.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.800
Those who pass away also
have dreams and ambitions.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.460
But everyone has something else,
just as important.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:50.130
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers…
Those who are dear to them.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.790
They trust each other and help each other,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.790
the people whom they’ve cherished
since the day they were born.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.790
And that string which connects
those people

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.630
becomes stronger and
thicker as time goes by…

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.790
It can’t be explained by logic…

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:16.170
Those who hold those strings just do it,
because it’s important to them.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.210
Yeah, I kind of get it.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.210
But…

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.790
It's tough to die.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:31.710
It’s not like he just died for nothing.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.380
He left us something very important.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:39.790
Well, you’ll eventually understand
one of these days.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.790
Yeah, I kind of get that too!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.130
The rain’s stopped.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.300
Bye! Iruka Sensei!

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.460
Yeah…

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.750
Lord Third Hokage,
the will of fire you spoke of

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:14.790
seems to have been passed on
to the young Leaves.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:19.960
The flame in their hearts
which you lit

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.750
will burn bright and strong…

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.130
And it will shine upon this village,
and watch over and protect us.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.170
It will become a new Hokage…
one of these days…

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.960
They did manage to avoid annihilation,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.750
but it seems the damage
is pretty extensive.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.000
The village that was once
at the height of its glory…

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:56.880
How sad…

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.460
How unlike you.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.840
You have lingering affections
for your old home?

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.880
Even you?

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.130
No, not at all.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.840
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.800
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:40.300
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.210
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.960
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:54.420
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:22:00.250
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:05.210
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:10.170
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:19.460
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.920
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.630
The ritual ends, and morning mist
will be covering all soon.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:54.790
Silence…

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:59.500
In that white mist,
the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:07.130
It awakens childhood memory,
disappointment, ire, and resolve.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:13.590
The cog wheel named destiny
slowly begins to turn…

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.460
Next time: “Return of the Morning Mist”
