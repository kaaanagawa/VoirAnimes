WEBVTT

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:09.830
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.080
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.380
One more time

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.080
Are you really happy

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.630
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.330
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.000
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.630
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.870
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.870
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.920
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.080
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:26.870
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.920
One more time

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.870
Summoning Jutsu!

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.710
This time for sure, the frog will…

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.750
What’s a frog anyway?!

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.870
From which stage do you
call it a frog?!

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.870
Live or Die:
Risk it All to Win it All!

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.130
Hey! Hold up a hope
on me a bit, would you?!

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.290
Whew… he collapsed again…

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.880
That’s no surprise…

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.500
For three weeks, he’s continued
his training on guts alone…

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.960
Lord Hokage.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.790
Anko, is it…?

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.710
I’m sorry, I’m...

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.750
Regretting returning alive
from the Forest of Death?

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.630
That’s a needless thing because you and
Orochimaru have no connection at all.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.750
There is no Shinobi who can compete
against that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.630
Even if I was the one to face him…

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.870
If the Fourth Hokage were still alive…

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.960
Don’t say that.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.870
He already saved this village and died…

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.000
That’s a story from 13 years ago.
He’s no longer here.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.460
We have to do something
with our power.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.960
Yes.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.790
I’m going to get some fesh air…

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.380
Don’t blame yourself.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.870
C’mon, open your eyes already.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.830
W-What’s that…?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.630
To be clear, you have no sense.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.670
Oh! Pervy Sage!

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.460
After you’ve been training for 3 weeks,
you are still this level.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.040
If you continue like this it’s pointless.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.460
That’s not how it is!
I’m doing this with all my might!

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.080
I understand that, if you really want
to succeed at Summoning Jutsu,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.130
you have to do it like you’re going
to die or it’s no good at all.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.870
That’s what I’m doing!

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.170
I drill my Chakra every day
like I’m going to die.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.420
If you have time to complain about it,
teach me a trick or something!

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.830
A trick, huh… A trick.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.960
What?! You’re going to teach me?

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.920
You need to risk your life on it.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.540
L-Life…?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.750
It’s not a joke.
Even so, will you do it?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.290
O-Of course!
I always risk my life!

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.870
I see…

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.870
Huh…?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.870
Well then, follow me.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.960
What are we doing at a place like this?

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.920
You’re not gonna peek again,
are you?

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.210
Well, that would be nice,
but today it’s a bath.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.000
First, we purify our bodies…

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.130
Huh?

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.870
There’s something strange going on…

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.870
This is such a nice bath.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.500
Like heaven… Truly heavenly…

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.040
Hey, Pervy Sage.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.870
I’m Toad Sage.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.330
Whatever, but how are taking
a bath and Summoning related?

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.870
Hey, hey, hey, hey--!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.960
What is it?!

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.790
Hey, Naruto.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.830
Huh?

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.630
Is there something you want to eat?

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.580
I’m going to eat!

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.540
It’s good! If the training is like this,
I’ll do it every day!

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.250
Eat up! Because this is the last…

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:52.960
Huh?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.040
No, nothing. Anyway, eat!
Eat a lot!

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.870
Like there’s no looking back!

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.500
I don’t know what’s going on,
but I should eat, right? Okay!

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.870
Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:17.870
Gotcha!

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.290
One more!

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.420
Coming right up!

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.960
This time miso char siu!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.870
Yeah!

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.040
I ate, I ate.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.210
Thank you, Pervy Sage…

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.870
What?!

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.250
Thanks for your patronage!

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.420
I won’t even get blood from it…

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.870
Yo, are you full?

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.870
Don’t mess with me, Pervy Sage!

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.870
Weren’t you treating me
with the meal!

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.040
Fool! Who said that
I was treating you?!

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.170
Aren’t you a grown-up?! Bastard!

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.790
By the by, Naruto,
isn’t there a girl that you like?

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.170
Huh?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.870
I asked if you have a lovely girl?

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.380
Well…you could say she’s there,
you could say I like her…

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.210
You could say it’s Sakura.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.420
So there is?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.170
It’s Sakura!

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.960
Okay! Then go and
hug that girl tight!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.500
What?!

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.880
Is that a part of the training?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.000
Well, close enough.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.870
Okay! Right away…

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.870
But if I do that, Sakura will…

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.500
No! This is training too!
I have to do it or I won’t be strong…

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.750
But if I do that, Sakura will…

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.420
For a while she won’t talk to me…

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.580
No! If I’m going to master
Summoning Jutsu,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.040
this can’t be helped!

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.540
But…Sakura will…

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.000
No! But…

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.130
Hurry up and go!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.130
What do you want?

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.170
No, uh…well…

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.040
If it’s money you want,
I won’t lend it to you.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.870
I may not look it,
but I’m stingy with money.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.960
No, that’s not it…

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.540
Well…

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:28.210
Uh, if I tell her it’s for my training,
she’s sure to beat me.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.870
If there’s nothing you want,
then I ’ll go home.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.580
W-Wait a minute!

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.540
Oh…

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.460
This is it!
This is my chance!

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.670
Sakura! I’m sorry!

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.870
Hey!

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.420
What are you doing?!

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.250
Cha!

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.250
Ow… Ouch…

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.540
This is a part of being young…

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.750
Hey, if I do this I’ll really get a frog?

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.630
Yes, that’s a definite.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.210
Really…?

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.790
Is there anything you’ve left undone?

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:22.790
Huh?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.580
None?

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.710
What are you talking about…?

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.580
To pull out enormous Chakra
and use it.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.330
It is certain that it is difficult
to have the control to do it…

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.670
It is also certain that this body
is a vessel too small

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.920
to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.750
It’s likely that Naruto’s body normally
tends to reject

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.040
the strength of the Nine-Tailed Fox
in order to avoid too much strain.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.870
If the excitement of danger and
emotion are the key

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.670
to drawing out the
Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.380
he has to learn physically until
he can automatically use that key.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.290
Nothing personal…
Fourth Hokage!

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.460
Huh? Where…is this…?

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.170
Stand up!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.290
W-What’s going on?!

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.000
Your training ends here.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.330
Huh? I haven’t done anything yet…!

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.250
Naruto!

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.870
Go die and come back.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.380
Die?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.130
From within the dreadfulness of death,
squeeze out enormous Chakra!

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.870
Experience it with your own body,
and grasp the technique of it!

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.960
If you don’t want to die,
do something about it yourself… Got it?

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:18.630
Now…we’ll see if the strength given
to you is really yours.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.040
If I don’t grab onto this… I’ll die!

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.460
Now!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.330
It’s impossible…

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.210
This rock surface is slippery
from the seepage of the waterfall.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.870
Besides, falling in that speed
with the control of Chakra that you have,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.210
you can’t cling to the rock.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.080
Naruto, after this…

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.580
you can only depend on
the Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.960
Open up the key…
This time from your side!

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.420
If I go on like this!
lf I go on like this! I’ll seriously die!

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.710
Die!

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.870
Die…

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.750
Today, we’ll have
a history lesson outside.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.210
As you know, this rock face has
the faces of the Hokage line.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.670
In order from the left,
they’re lined up fom the First,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:43.000
the Second…
the Third…and the Fourth.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.130
So different from the present old man.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.960
Especially the receding hairline…

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.000
Iruka Sensei! Who’s the Fifth?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.130
Hmm?

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.080
Well, that hasn’t been decided yet…

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.870
Perhaps it’s your teacher here!

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:12.000
Hmm… Weaving an occasional joke
to make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.710
L-Lord Hokage!

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.920
Oh, it’s the Third.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.790
Hey! Old man!
What did you come to do?

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.420
I wanted to see the rock faces too.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.870
You’ve come at a good time.
Over this way, my lord.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.870
This is the real man of
the third rock face!

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.870
The Third Hokage!

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.040
The third was called the strongest,
a genius,

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.500
called “professor” among
past Hokage!

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.130
– What?! 					– Huh?!

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.870
Hey! Iruka, don’t say it
in the past tense.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.870
S-Sorry.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.290
Are you really strong?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.880
Yeah, you don’t look it!

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.420
Yep! That’s right!

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.210
Enough!

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:07.920
To take over the name of Hokage
means you’re the strongest in this village!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.710
Okay! I’m going to become
the Fifth Hokage!

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.210
After all I’m really strong,
and handsome too!

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.870
It won’t work with
the scores you have now!

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.460
You’ve got a lot of confidence!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.380
You all are quite young,
unlike me!

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.460
There might be someone who will
take the name of Hokage is in this group.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.870
You only have one life!

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.170
Don’t choose an impossible road.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.750
It doesn’t matter if you live as
you like and die as you like.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.630
However…

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.000
no matter what route you take,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.210
remember to protect the
people important to you!

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.040
Important people?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:17:01.080
That you acknowledge…
trust and love from your heart.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.630
Do you have people like that?

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.870
Y-Yeah… Dad and Mom…

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.870
and I hate him a little,
but my big brother too.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.330
And… 					my dog Gonta…

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.630
For me, it’s friends!

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.630
Me too!

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.170
Lord Hokage, you have
people like that too?

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.000
Yes, of course I do!

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.420
Really! Who, who?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.790
I have my grandchild…
Konohamaru over there and…

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.710
All of the people in this village!

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:57.870
Like you did too, once…

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.580
Huh?!

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.870
This feeling… It’s that Chakra…

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.080
This is…

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:10.000
Seal

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.540
I-It’s huge… What is it?

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:26.000
Hey kid, come closer!

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.250
I want to eat and kill you,
but this gate won’t open…

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.630
Bloody spell that seals…

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.170
You're…

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.000
the Nine-Tailed Fox!

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.920
I see… the red Chakra
was this guy’s Chakra.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.040
For you to approach me…

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.130
What business brought you here?

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.170
Hey! You stupid fox!

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:17.870
Since you’re staying in my body,
as your rent, lend me your Chakra!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.630
After all, if you die I die.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.630
That’s some impressive courage
for threatening me!

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.040
That’s fine…

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.380
As a reward for making it this far…
I’ll give it to you!

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.710
This is the feeling!

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.580
Summoning Jutsu!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.870
Well done.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.870
Where am I?!

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.420
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.870

All over the world, the sky’s smiling,

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:37.460

Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.790
Yay! This time for sure,
I’ve finally brought out the real toad.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.710
Listen, you giant toad,
I am your master from today!

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:02.290
Huh? No, nothing.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.170
I will be your henchman, boss.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:06.870
I’m so happy…

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.750
Next time, "He Flies! He Jumps!
He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!"

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:16.670
He’s seriously scary.
I’ve never seen a toad like this one.
