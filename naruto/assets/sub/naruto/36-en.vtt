WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.250
I’ve…had it…

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.320
Oh, Sakura!

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.460
For crying out loud,
how far have we walked?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.360
The tower hasn’t gotten a bit closer.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.800
Here we can see it
right in front of our eyes.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.500
Strange…

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.170
No mistake about it.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.970
It seems that we’re already within
the enthusiastic welcome.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.640
Take a look at that.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.140
Huh?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.610
Oh, that can’t be!

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.720
What on earth is going on?!

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.190
No way!

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.590
Is it Genjutsu…?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.860
So it seems.
We were lured in perfectly.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.460
It appears we were meticulously careful,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.470
and were made to walk
around the same place in a circle.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.300
We’re being watched…

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.840
Probably.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.440
They intend to wear down
our physical strength and

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.540
catch us unprepared when
 we’re bone-tired.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.540
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.310
Then.... They’ll be coming soon.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.690
Humph, they’ve appeared.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.030
This is the perfect handicap.
 Believe it!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.400
Clone vs. Clone:
Mine are Better than Yours!

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.540
W-What is this?

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.270
It’s quite a number.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.640
Moreover, they’re clones?

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.650
Cornered rats.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.520
Shut up!

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.500
Oh, they’re quite weak, huh?

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.570
Good!

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.770
Naruto!

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.020
W-What are these guys?

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.570
W-What’s going on here?

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.780
I’ll assess this!

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.540
Sharingan!

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.180
Naruto!

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.470
Sasuke!

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.310
Sasuke!

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.420
W-What’s going on?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.720
My body’s…

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.260
Are you okay?

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.400
No mistake.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.900
It’s the real thing, not an illusion.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.610
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.750
That Kabuto was injured means
these things are actual Shadow Clones?!

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.650
B-But... even though Shadow clones
are supposed to vanish

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.460
if they take a direct attack,
these things don't vanish.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.560
Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.090
Which is it?!

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.200
Scroll please.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.560
Scroll please.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.900
Give me scroll.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.530
Dang it!

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000
It’s futile!

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.840
Stop!

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.510
These things are illusions.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.540
It’s an enemy Genjutsu.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.420
B-But, Kabuto’s wound is the real thing.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.720
No, it’s as Sasuke says.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.860
Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere…

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.560
and coordinating their attack with
movements of the “Genjutsu Shinobis”

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.630
and attacking from a different location.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.100
Pretending as if those
Genjutsu Shinobis are attacking.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.540
– Scroll please.
– Scroll please.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.550
Then I’ll find the idiot who’s behind
the scenes

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.880
throwing Kunai knives
and kick his butt, believe it!

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.250
Hold it, Naruto.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.360
We’ve been deceived as
to the source of the Kunai knives…

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.660
so we can’t discover the precise
location of the enemy like this.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.430
Do you get it?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.560
That is the enemy’s purpose.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.370
From a data standpoint, it’s a type
who is weak at close combat

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.900
and Taijutsu that likes
this kind of attack.
95	02:22:38:03	02:22:42:29
							The true enemy won’t come out
		until we can’t move at all.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.210
Listen, everyone!

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.550
In any case,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.820
all there is to do now is to fend
off the enemy attack.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.720
Fine, if that’s what their plan is…

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.990
Now then…
I wonder how far they can hold out.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.730
The night is long.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.890
Man! 					This is endless!

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.020
Since it’s come to this…!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.020
Stop!

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.060
Naruto, don’t waste your Chakra!

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.930
Even if you attack these things,
there’s no point!

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.570
If I hit them all in
a single sweep,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.800
the enemy won’t fire inadvertently
while these things are reverting back.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.310
The hiding place will
be discovered, so.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.510
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.550
Shadow Clones?!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.910
It’s not over yet!

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.010
Sasuke, what should we do…?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.450
Man, that loser.
All there is to do is go for it!

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.450
B-But…

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.710
Indeed…

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.080
It’s not a situation that
he can get through by himself.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.550
Let’s go, Sakura!

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.420
Y-Yeah!

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.710
I’m not finished yet…

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.560
Dawn is breaking.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.190
It’s finally time for the hunt.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.560
Mubi, that’s enough.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.170
We’re finished hunting their spirits.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.900
Now what’s left is just their bodies.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.940
Lucky.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.550
You’re…the one who…
did my left shoulder.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.550
I finally found you.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.720
You really hung me up.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:44.090
Lucky.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.320
I can finally even the score.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.480
You…really hung me up.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.180
Lucky.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.650
I can finally even the score.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.260
Heh!

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.000
Cornered rats.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.540
It went well, Naruto!

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.620
W-What the heck
are these guys?!

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.550
T-This can’t be!

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.850
Since when…?!

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.420
Idiot!

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.560
You finally showed your
true colors, punk!

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.970
T-This brat, don’t tell me…

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.570
The Shadow Clone is just
the preparation for the trick...

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.110
for me to portray every member
of the team by myself!

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.980
At the same time Naruto
lifted the Shadow Clone,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.680
the three of us hid.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.020
The Genjutsu users were
adversely deceived.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.900
Naruto!

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.570
Naruto, you’ve used too much Chakra.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.670
I’ll do the rest.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.490
No way! I’m not always going to have
the good parts taken away!

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.130
Is this really that Naruto…?

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.800
Since when had he improved
this much?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.710
That’s some brat…

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.780
I can’t believe he can still move.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.510
Naruto…

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.050
Amazing Chakra stamina…

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.260
Right after
a Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu…

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.730
a daring technique that transforms just
three of the bodies into his companions.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.600
To think he can still move
even after doing all that.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.170
Here it’s the fifth day now.

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.510
This kid will transform

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.110
if he can just master
the use of his Chakra.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.650
Not bad.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.820
But we’re still not unlucky.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.960
There’s no time.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.830
This time around,
we’ll show you our Ninjutsu!

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.500
Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.340
Shadow clones?

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.170
No, they are plain clones.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.880
However, he's up to something.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.210
Be careful!

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.180
Hah! If they are just clones,
then there’s one real body.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.720
I’ll kick their butts right
and left until I run into him.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.750
You idiot.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.390
Such a tactless thing…

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.920
I’m telling you!

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.920
I’m saying don’t stick your nose in!

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.260
Naruto!

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.300
That’s reckless!

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.100
Cripes!

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.110
From earlier, the nape of my neck
hurts when I use the Sharingan.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.150
Maybe I used too much Chakra.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.920
Dang it!

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.550
Dang it. A clone?!

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.190
This one, too?!

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:12.560
This one, too?!

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.560
This one, too?!

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.590
Naruto! Stop!

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.230
Are they all fakes?!

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.100
Or could it be Genjutsu again?!

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.440
This is… the last…Chakra.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.670
Sharingan!

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.550
Sasuke!

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.090
The bruise again…

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.190
Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.430
It won’t do to create an opening!

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:05.840
Kabuto!

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.180
Darn it!

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.550
Stop! Naruto!

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.090
No matter how much
you swing at them,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.890
the real body isn’t in those clones.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.460
Then where’s the enemy
attacking us from?!

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.070
If they are merely clones,
the clones themselves can’t attack!

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.570
If I knew that, we wouldn’t be
having a rough time of it!

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.540
This is the enemy’s scheme.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.580
Man, I can’t use
the Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore…

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.550
They’ve about reached their limit.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.250
Lucky.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:55.690
That’s it!

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.860
The real body hides with
the Earth Style Jutsu

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.700
and attacks from behind a clone!

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.000
Kabuto!

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.140
Heh, “it won’t do to
create an opening,” right?!

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.550
Thank you, Naruto.
You saved me.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.180
We're okay here, Naruto!

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.430
What happened there?  Are you hurt?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.170
That’s a terrible bruise.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.540
It’s nothing.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.110
Here it is, here it is!

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.680
Look, the Heaven scroll!

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.010
Good for you.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.550
There’s something about this guy...
that I don’t like.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.370
Oh, it’s you guys.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.540
You’re late, Kabuto.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.000
I got a bit involved in something.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.540
Sorry.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:54.540
But, but…
thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.710
No, it’s because you guys fought hard.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:01.420
You were amazing
at the end, Naruto.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.690
We’re going through this door.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.930
Well then, I wish us both luck.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.100
Yeah!

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.230
Yeah!

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.780
What of the harvest?

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.010
Yes.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.550
More than I expected.

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.680
I filled in his entire data
from this second exam.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.190
You need this, right?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.090
So, how was it?

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.530
Sure enough, it appears you’re curious.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:45.200
Master Orochimaru.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.300
I want to ask your opinion.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.330
As a Sound Village’s spy…

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.640
That’s not necessary, is it?

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.540
You will be the one to decide it all, so…

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.180
I like that cleverness of yours.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.320
Good work.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.690
There’s nobody here.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.090
I’m okay now, Sakura.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.630
O-Okay.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.460
That’s too bad!

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.230
Cha!

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.970
Say-say, what’re we supposed to do?

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.970
Oh! Look at that…

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:32.640
Without… Heaven…
I don’t get it at all.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.840
If “Heaven” does not exist,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.510
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.550
If “Earth” does not exist,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.480
run the fields in search
of an advantage.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.550
Open the series of
Heaven and Earth,

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.490
and the perilous way
shall be redressed…

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.160
This is namely the secret of
“the one that guides…”

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.960
What’s that?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.930
It looks like there are letters
or something missing there.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.600
It’s probably has to do with the scroll.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.670
I think this means we’re supposed
to open the Heaven &amp; Earth scroll.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.260
Okay then, I’m going to open it.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:31.770
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:40.010
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:49.550
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:57.890
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:04.900
Or else I’ll cry

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.670
You won't have to search around you

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.480
It’s all ok now.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:21.320
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.660
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.230
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.000
Just sing.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.500
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.610
The two are one

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:49.050
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:54.550
Hey, can you hear it?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.320
What’s this, what’s this?

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.760
Here I thought that the really
strong ones were remaining,

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.560
but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru,
all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.570
And that Lee’s team, too.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.140
So much for getting all inflated.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.140
Well, I’m the man who’s going
to become the Hokage.

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.140
I must impress them and

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:20.810
show that I’m not in the same class
as any ordinary blockhead!

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:25.550
