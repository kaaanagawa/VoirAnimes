WEBVTT

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.550
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.560
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.560
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.430
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.540
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.540
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.650
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.890
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.920
It will come, closer

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.830
Now

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.410
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.610
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.540
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.120
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.580
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.190
There will be no meaning

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.560
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.190
Tenten vs. Temari

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.560
The fifth battle…

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.230
Tenten, Temari…come forward!

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.170
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.880
Now…The second one from
the Land of Sand, huh…

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380
Do your best!

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.880
– Tenten!
– It looks like it's going to be interesting.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.630
Begin!

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.500
Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.810
Go for it, Tenten!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.610
Believe in your own strength, Tenten!

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.750
We’re behind you, Tenten!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.350
Knock her with all your strength!

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.550
That’s good!

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.550
Cheer her on more, more,
more with passion, Lee!

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.020
Yeah!

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.390
These guys are noisy!

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.900
That spacing is just what I’d expect
from Tenten,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.140
not too close, not too far.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.710
Attacks or defense,
she can respond to either one.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.980
What happened?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.380
Please begin.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.080
Are you planning to wait out and
see how I make my move?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.550
Let me just tell you,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.660
once I start my attack
you’ll be over in a second.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.690
You’re trying to be cool and
see what I do first…

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.700
A hundred years too early!

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.570
It doesn’t matter to me, come first.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.470
You said it…

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.170
Well, I won’t hold back.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:53.810
They missed?

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.110
That’s impossible!

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.550
What happened?
ls that a warm-up?

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.550
Or are you scared and your aim is off?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.190
I thought I would enjoy it
a little bit more,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.390
but evidently it’s not promising.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.560
No way!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.960
I can’t believe Tenten’s attack missed!

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.900
It’s unbelievable indeed.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.130
Tenten’s weapons...

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.900
always hits the mark
ten out of ten times.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.540
There no reason for them to miss.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.840
That’s right...
She didn’t miss.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.550
She was made to miss.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.120
As always, she’s being disagreeable.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.550
How foolish…

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.350
How disgraceful!

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.560
Huh?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.890
Sand wins again.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.360
We don’t know that yet.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.200
We know.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.060
How? 					How do we know?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.130
Explain it so I understand!

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.470
Stupid... As if I'd do
such a bothersome thing.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.980
Shikamaru said it so,
surely that’s how it is.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.980
These guys are hard to understand.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.250
Calm down…

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.160
Don’t let her get to you…

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.390
One.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.260
Two.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.430
Three…

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.600
If it’s gonna get dodged,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.570
I just have to make
it impossible to!

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.710
So she’s measuring the spacing,
next one is going to be the big attack.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.540
I get it…

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.540
So, that fan is the secret.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.650
If so…

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.960
How about…this?!

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.480
No way!

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.310
My flying weapons!

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.150
Is there a secret mechanism
in the fan…?

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.250
This is…

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.550
the first star.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.190
There are two more.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.760
When the third star appears,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.060
you will lose.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.070
Tenten!

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.070
Don’t be taken in by
your opponent, be calm!

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.940
Be calm!

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.440
I know…

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.540
Lee, I really intended to use
this in the main battle,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.210
not the preliminary round--

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.550
but it looks like I can’t do it that way.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.420
She’s already going to use it?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.230
Pulling out two scrolls?

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.300
What does she intend to do?

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.140
Hah! No matter what you do,
it won’t work.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.480
Rising Twin Dragons!

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.910
Even if you increase the amount,
it’s still the same!

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.110
Second star!

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.680
I’m not done yet!

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.540
Did I do it?

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.260
Third star.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:37.760
She disappeared!

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.570
Where is she?

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.540
I’m over here!

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.740
Darn--!

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.650
Ninja Art!

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.720
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.560
Tenten!

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.840
Chakra is enfolded in that wind.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.580
Huh?!

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.810
Tenten fought well…

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.180
But she won’t be able to escape from
that twister.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.190
T-That’s awful.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.130
Tenten…!

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.530
How boring... really.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.540
To think she completely intercepted
Tenten’s weapon attacks.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.370
This is ridiculous!

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.340
What’s going on with her…?

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.980
It’s just like Shikamaru said,
it’s the Sand’s win.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.350
That’s why I said it.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.260
There’s no reason for us to lose here.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.360
The Land of Sand is to be feared…

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.570
Temari wins the fifth battle.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.540
Oh no!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.720
Nice catch.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.020
What are you doing?!

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.030
Is that something you do to
an opponent who fought to the utmost?!

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.560
You’re annoying!

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.860
Take that trash away already!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.100
Stop! Lee!

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.170
Leaf Hurricane!

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.200
What?!

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.070
You’re just like you look…

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.580
You’re dull too.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:05.980
What did you say?!

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:07.880
Stop! Lee!

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.810
Guy Sensei!

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.380
Temari.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.550
Come up quick, you’ve been
declared the winner.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.960
Don’t keep company with that awful-looking
guy and his chaperone forever.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:23.730
What…?!

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.140
That’s enough, Lee.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.150
Gentlemen of Sand…

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.180
I wonder if I may give you
a word of warning.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.150
This kid is strong.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.560
You should prepare yourselves.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.560
Picking a fight with the Sand…

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.270
I absolutely wouldn't want to
do it with those guys.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.400
T-They’re all awesome guys…

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.580
Don’t lose to those guys!

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.550
Naruto!

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.510
S-Sakura.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.720
Sakura… Are you okay already?

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.550
Never mind that,
you should worry about yourself!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.760
Huh? Me? I don’t have
an injury or anything.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.390
That’s not what I mean.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.560
If you lose here, it’s a point of dishonor.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.570
You’d be ashamed to face Sasuke!

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:36.430
Y- Yeah.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:37.770
And…

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.540
Thanks for earlier…

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.540
No!

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.710
Sakura!

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.750
You did your hardest
to get here!

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.550
You’ll disgrace women if
you lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.590
If it weren’t for your stupid cheering
at that time…

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.560
I would have been soundly
beaten by Ino.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:02.590
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.560
Y-You!

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.970
Okay, hurry hurry! 					Me next!

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.570
Next! 					Next is my turn!

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.540
Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.340
Darn!

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.180
It’s me.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.110
Shikamaru, don’t lose!

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.480
– Show us that you’re a real man!
– All right, all right.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.320
Get her with the 16 combo, go!

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.690
– Win Shikamaru!
– Ino’s become super energetic.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.130
You go for it!

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.730
That guy manipulates shadows.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.000
Be careful of the shadows…

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.440
I won’t be beaten by
a stupid technique like that.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.210
Shikamaru!

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.180
Bash that one around!
And while you're at it...

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.010
Man, what a pain.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.250
Furthermore, my opponent is a woman…
lt's hard to get to it.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.420
If that’s what you think,
I’ll end this quickly.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.190
Go, go! Shikamaru!

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.090
Well, you could say that
I know these guys’ raw power

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.730
from that incident from the second test…

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.570
I don’t know anything about this one’s Jutsu.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.440
On top of that, she’s seen my Jutsu…

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.780
– The sixth battle.
– That being said, for me…

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.380
Shikamaru versus Kin!

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.510
Begin!

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.380
I can only do this.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.720
One trick pony, huh…?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.090
Shut up!

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.560
Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.690
That Jutsu!

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.560
It’s nothing if I just pay attention
to the movement of your shadow!

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.640
Bells…?

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.510
Heh, that’s a classic.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.540
Next, you’ll throw Senbons with bells

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.350
and Senbons without bells
at the same time, right?

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.420
I’ll respond to the sound of the bells,
intending to dodge them.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.150
But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,
and, ouch.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.090
Is that right?

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.560
You’re a chatty guy!

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.400
So in order to not get caught
by the shadow Senbons…

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.300
I'm alert to the trick
and look closely…

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.130
What?!

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:24.530
Behind?!

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.540
String?

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.840
Darn it!

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.540
Too late!

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.650
Shikamaru!

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.480
He took that pretty bad.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.080
It wasn’t tat bad, look closely.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.550
Huh?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.690
F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.720
Now it’s my turn!

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.560
That’s not going to happen.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.610
W-What’s this?

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.550
That happens to anyone
who hears my bell.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.550
The sound vibration of
this special bell

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.720
reaches the brain directly
from the ear drum.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.330
And then it will make you hallucinate.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.400
It’s useless!

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.530
You can’t avoid the sound of
my bell by doing...

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.540
that... that... that... that... that...

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:38.010
Shoot! Which one?
Which is the real one?

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.040
You can’t do anything, can you?

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:47.250
Your shadow, which was your faint hope,
doesn’t even know where to stretch to…

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.890
Well… I’ll cook you slowly.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.560
Taking me lightly…!

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.540
This time it’s five,
next time seven…

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.940
I’ll continue until you become
a hedgehog.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.510
Y-You’re lying, you brat!

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.110
Huh?!

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.450
You’d end it soon…

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.880
That’s what you said
in the beginning, isn’t it?

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.690
I see, you can’t endure the pain
and want to be eased.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.690
Well, I’ll finish it here.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:28.360
It’s your death warrant.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:34.730
W-What?!

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.530
M-My body…

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.540
At last, Shadow Possession Jutsu
is a success.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.640
W-What are you saying?

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.610
No way!
Your shadow isn’t anywhere...

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.420
You don’t realize it yet?

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.550
I-It can’t be…

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.450
It's just that, you fool!

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.430
A thread at this height
can’t have a shadow.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.060
I can stretch and shrink
my own shadow.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.270
The shadow is gradually getting thicker.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.540
This wasn’t the shadow of the thread…

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.470
That's right. I stretched my shadow
and made it narrow,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.280
so it looked like the shadow of
a thread and stuck it on you.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.720
But… How do you win with that?

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.420
I’m just gonna move
the same way as you.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.850
Annoying.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.390
Be quiet and watch.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.230
Stupid!

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.900
If you continue like this and attack…

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.470
You, too, 					will be wounded!

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.440
I know that.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.270
No way! You're...!

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.580
We’re gonna throw shuriken
at each other.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.850
How far will we go…?

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.810
Fool, stop it!

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.990
You're only talk...

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.460
And that one's a goner.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
If you’re a shinobi,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.560
you have to grasp the situation
and the layout when you battle.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.400
Even though we made
the same movements…

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.670
the distance of the walls behind
each of us was different.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.070
I just used the shuriken and

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:28.310
called attention away
from the wall behind us.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.180
Winner! Shikamaru Nara.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.380
Good job Shikamaru!

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:34.890
Cool!

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.920
Me next…

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:38.390
Me next… Me next…!

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.060
That guy’s dull and plain,
but that was kinda cool.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:43.930
Shoot!

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.460
I’m the only one left.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.400
And the next match.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.270
The people left are one Sound ninja,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.610
me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.540
And that Sand guy…

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.380
Just please spare me from that guy.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.180
This year’s rookie looks quite challenging…

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.370
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.000
It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.740
What we’ve been waiting for!

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.540
It’s finally my turn!

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.980
Yeah! Lucky us!

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.810
If it’s this guy
we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:37.910
Yahoo!

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:40.420
– If I’m not next, Sakura will despise me...
– I'm gonna do it!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.720
– and call me Bushy Brow.
– I'm gonna go for it!

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.020
– If I’m not next. Sakura will...
– Just watch me! Yay!

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.030
This Lee kid, he’s just like
Guy was in the past…

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.930
Do your best, Naruto.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.170
Leave it to me.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.970
Well Naruto, show us…

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.380
how much you’ve grown.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.550
I’m going to do it!

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.490
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:32.840
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:42.550
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:50.720
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.630
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.560
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.300
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:14.140
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.550
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:24.050
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.860
Just sing.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.360
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.570
The two are one

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:41.910
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:47.540
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.250
Darn that Kiba!

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.990
I hold back a little bit and
he rides my brain.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.560
Yap, yap, yap, yap,
it’s annoying! Believe it!

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.560
Just quit talking tough, and use your dog
or whatever, and come at me!

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.460
I don’t know what kind of
training you’ve done,

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.960
but I’m the man who’s going
to become Hokage.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.630
You’re the one who’s going
to get his butt kicked.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.900
Next time: “Akamaru Unleashed!
Who’s Top Dog Now?”

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.210
Don’t take me lightly!
