WEBVTT

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
One more time

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you really happy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:54.680
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.840
Sasuke’s movements have stopped!
There’s still quite a bit of distance, though…

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.430
So Sasuke caught up to him, huh?

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.220
Okay!

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.840
Huh? This smell is…?!

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.470
W-What’s wrong?!

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.720
Did something happen to Sasuke?!

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840
I didn't notice until now.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.260
You…

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.640
use the same shampoo as me.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.930
This floral green fragrance…
No doubt!

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.970
H-Hey now…!

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.840
Well…my coat’s shinier.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.470
Don’t be saying stupid things
at such an important time!

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.840
– I'm the same as a dog?
– Sorry, sorry…

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.430
Same as a dog… Same as a dog…

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
– Hey Sakura?
– Same as a dog…

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.220
Same as a dog…

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.180
Same as a dog… Same as a dog…

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.760
Hey Sakura…! 					Wait!

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.840
Oh! Hey! Don’t go ahead of me!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.550
A Mistake from the Past:
A Face Revealed!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.430
Dang it!

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100
I won’t let you get away now!

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.970
Jeez, this kid of all people…
at a time when Gaara is like this.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.300
Man, this is bad.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.470
Heh! That’s fine.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.390
Kankuro! Take Gaara and go quickly!

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.850
Leave him to me!

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.680
But Temari…!

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.600
No matter how you look at it,
you can't beat him alone!

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.760
Leave me be!

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.970
This is an important mission for
the Village Hidden in the Sand!

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.600
Make Gaara the first priority!

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.350
Besides, he’s quite my type of a guy…

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.970
Go! Kankuro!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.930
I don’t think so!

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680
I won’t let you get away!

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.220
Eat this!

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.800
My opponent is that Uchiha kid…

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.840
This is not good. I only have
a bit of Chakra left.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.840
I’ll stand even less of a chance
if he uses his Sharingan here…

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.100
But I need to get him to use
a large amount of Chakra at any cost.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.800
Shall I take care of her in
one hit with Chidori? Or…

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.720
In this situation, maybe I should…

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.470
As I thought… He’s trying to save
some Chakra for Gaara.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.840
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.260
Don’t underestimate me!

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.010
Ninja Art: Sand Storm!

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.510
Darn! I have to do something about
that bothersome fan…

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.010
Humph… I wonder how long
you’ll last with such a way of fighting.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.600
It can’t be helped…

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.220
It looks like you’ve finally
gotten serious, eh?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.390
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.930
That’s the stuff!

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.510
Aim with precision!

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.220
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.800
Did I get her?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.430
Wind Scythe Jutsu!

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840
I’ve got you.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.100
Oh no!

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.220
Now!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.600
You’re mine!

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.600
Good!

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.100
W-What?! Substitution?!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.760
Oh no!

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.180
Sorry, but I don’t have the time
to be dealing with you forever!

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.720
D-Dang it…
G-Gaara, at any cost…

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.840
What's that?!

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.050
What the heck is going on?

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.350
Who the heck is that youth?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.550
Who on earth are you?!

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.050
Is it so sudden you can’t tell?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.470
It’s me. Orochimaru.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.430
It can’t be… Have you completed
that Forbidden Jutsu?

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.100
I struggled for decades…
after leaving the village.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.840
You’re a truly frightening,
inhuman monster!

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.840
So, he did it, huh…?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.970
The reason I couldn’t select you
to be the Fourth Hokage…

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.100
is because of that distorted
consciousness.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.680
I’ve finally been found out, eh…?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.050
It’s too bad.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.680
Orochimaru…
What’s the meaning of this?!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.840
Here I’d set that
many booby traps…

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.010
so I was quite surprised.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.760
But I see… So it was you.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.840
Recently, there has been a steady stream
of people going missing from the village,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.970
from Genin to Chunin,
and even Anbu Black Ops members.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.840
There was also information that
you had been acting strange…

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
Master Orochimaru…

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.390
Why did a Shinobi of your rank
do such a thing?

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.260
Shall I kill you, too?

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.970
Orochimaru! Sure enough,
this was your doing…?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.680
Say it! What were you doing here?!

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.840
Alas! I’ve been found out.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.600
There’s no point in acting cute…

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.140
It’s for Jutsu development!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.470
Orochi… You!

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.430
For that purpose, you did this
to fellow Shinobi…?!

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.510
As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh…

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.350
What is it that you want?

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.720
I want everything!

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.260
Everything, you say?!

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.970
Get every Jutsu and understand
all of the truths of this world!

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.840
The one who first mixed
blue and yellow

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.840
named the new color made
in that way, green.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.760
I just want to do the same thing.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.970
If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign…

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.140
and green is a Jutsu.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.140
In the same way that there
are no limits to the kinds of colors,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.840
there are probably also tens
of thousands of Jutsu in this world…

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.300
But in order to get any
and all of the Jutsu…

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.840
as well as the truths,
a long time is necessary.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.720
It’s the one who takes those
long years to know everything,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.890
who can suitably be called
the ultimate individual.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.840
For me, the life span of
the body is too short.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.640
Too fleeting.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:41.840
Even if I were to be called the Hokage,
if I die, it all ends there.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.010
Orochimaru… Could it be that
the Jutsu you’re testing here is…

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.050
Right… It sure could be…

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.840
Immortality Jutsu!

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.510
Immortality Jutsu is a technique of

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.840
eternally pooling one’s own
spirits into this earth…

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.430
In other words,
it’s a Revival Jutsu where…

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:27.680
you find a new body, put your own spirit
into that body and take it over.

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.430
I assumed my old form until now,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.470
so that you would feel nostalgic
about our reunion…

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.140
Aging is an empty thing, isn’t it?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.300
I feel that keenly when I look at you.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.840
You’ll die here…

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.640
and I’ll get a younger,
more beautiful and stronger body…

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.470
The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun…

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.300
I get it…
You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.220
Right… Exactly… Sasuke.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.180
A Reviving Jutsu where
someone else’s body is stolen

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.800
and the spirit is immortalized, huh?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.010
How many faces and bodies
have you gone through?!

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:41.890
Two, I think…

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:47.800
I plan to take Sasuke over after
raising him a little more to my liking.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.550
But after all, in order to make you regret
your very own life…

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.840
and curse destiny as you die…

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.100
…perhaps this face is better?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.970
You monster!

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.800
Lord Hokage!

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.850
Don’t lower your guard, Sensei!
You’re always too soft…

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.140
What’s been wrong with you?
This isn’t like you!

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.720
I’m sorry…

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.640
Eyes…

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.300
Eyes with malice and ambition
concealed in them…

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.930
I had noticed that
you had such tendencies.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.260
I had noticed,
but pretended not to know.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.180
It was still during the war-torn era.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.010
A genius who brimmed
over strongly with ability…

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:40.180
Nothing less than a phenomenon
that comes once in several decades.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.470
So I wanted to think that

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.800
you would carry on
my own will and power.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.970
That softness on my part…

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.550
created the conditions of that time
as well as now!

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.840
Are you going to…kill me?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.760
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.970
I wonder if you can…
Sarutobi Sensei!

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.840
Kill him, Sarutobi!
Now’s your only chance!

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.220
Sarutobi… You…

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.800
I couldn’t kill him…

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.640
I’ll bury you and correct
my old mistakes, now!

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.010
Here I go!

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.260
It’s too late!

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.680
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.430
No way!
Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.260
To disperse the little Chakra
he has left…!

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.140
You’ve gotten old, after all…

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.390
To think you’d shorten your
own life span out of impatience…

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.840
D-Don’t tell me, you…?!

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.930
Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi…

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.840
This order of Signs…

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.760
I knew it, Sarutobi,
you are using that Jutsu!

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.640
So this is the Grim Reaper
the Fourth Hokage was talking about,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.930
which only the one who has signed
a contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.970
Whatever you do now, it’s too late…
I’ve won.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.430
The Leaf Village will crumble!

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.720
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
is the home where I live.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.840
The Hokage exists as the pillar
to protect that home!

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:40.100
The Hokage is the one who inherits
and is entrusted the will of the Leaf.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.390
I won’t go easily!

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.720
Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.260
Stupid nonsense…

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.470
You’re merely a temporal head

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.850
in the history of the organization
called the Leaf Village…

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:15.390
Even the face rock that is left
will eventually weather and decay.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.390
Humph… Leaf Village is
not just an organization to me!

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.430
In the Leaf Village,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.930
every year many Shinobi
are born and raised…

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.260
and live and fight…
and die to protect the village.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.140
The people of this village…

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.840
even if they don’t have blood ties…

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.010
To me, they are precious…

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.840
precious…

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.640
family!

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:32.720
Then I shall smash you, the pillar,
and destroy the Leaf home.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:39.390
Humph! Even if you kill me,
that pillar will not break!

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.840
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Will
of the First and Second Hokages…

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.050
The Third Hokage!

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.100
No matter how much you target
this Village Hidden in the Leaves…

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:59.850
A new Hokage will carry on my will,
shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.430
Right, Fourth Hokage?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.050
Orochimaru! Now I will perform
an ace Jutsu that even you don’t know!

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.840
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
Reaper Death Seal!

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:27.970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:39.300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:31.640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:42.180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.840
Every year in this village,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.840
Shinobi are born, nurtured,
and fight for the sake of the village.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:10.430
They live to protect the village and
things that are precious to them.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.890
Even if they aren’t related to me,
they are my precious family.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:23.050
I won’t let you have your way
with my family!

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.300

Reaper Death Seal!”
