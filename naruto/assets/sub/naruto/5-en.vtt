WEBVTT

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.930
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.200
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.610
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.280
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.010
For no single one,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.030
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.830
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.330
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.700
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.670
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.110
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.680
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.190
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.000
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.900
Rockin' my heart

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.420
You have to think when using Jutsu.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.020
They can be used against you.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.230
Also, don't get caught
in an obvious trap, you fool.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.900
A Ninja must see
through deception…got it?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.130
I know that!

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.840
You know, you say that because
you don't get it. Listen up.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.210
Your movements are wasteful.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.810
Now!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.320
He finally dropped his guard!

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.420
You're so...

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.820
No way!

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.530
You jerk Sasuke! You overdid it.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.440
Damn! Another substitution…?

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.110
He must have found out my location
with those Shuriken!

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.810
He purposely lowered his guard!
Serves me right…

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.110
I fell for the trap.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.380
So he's over there, eh…

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.620
Sasuke…Where are you…?!

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.090
Don't tell me,
Kakashi Sensei already…

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.830
No!

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.530
That couldn't happen to Sasuke, right?!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.870
Safe! He didn't notice me.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.500
Sakura, behind you.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.900
Huh?!

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.410
What's up with that "A Ninja must see
through deception" stuff?!

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.150
Darn it! I'll never fall for his trap again!

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.190
I fell for it again!

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.260
You Failed! Kakashi's Final Decision

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.120
What was that?! Huh?!

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.660
Hold on! Where's Sensei?!

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.020
Huh?! What's going on?!

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.830
Huh?! What's what?!

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.760
Sakura…

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.830
Sasuke?!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.730
Sa…Saku…ra…

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.340
P-Please…help…me…

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.280
Maybe I went a bit overboard…

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.020
But it's really something
she should notice…

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.020
Was that voice…Sakura's…?

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.630
Shinobi Battle Skill ♪2, Genjutsu.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.830
Sakura was easily lured.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.170
Genjutsu, huh...?

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.800
An illusory mind-controlling technique.
I'm not surprised she got lured.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.800
However…

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.710
I'm different from them.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.020
Why don't you say that after
you get a bell…Sasuke?

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.080
It's no use just using
straightforward attacks.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.180
A trap?!

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.450
What?!

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.740
This guy's...?!

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.840
What a guy.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.810
There's no time
to read "Make-Out Paradise."

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.250
What…? 					I…?!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.230
That's right! I saw Sasuke on
the verge of dying and I…

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.030
Sasuke!
Don't die and leave me here!!

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.030
Where are you?!

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.440
So that's what it looks like
behind the logs.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.280
Oh! There are box lunches on the stone!

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.020
A Ninja must see through deception... eh?

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.630
Well! I'll acknowledge that
you're different from those two.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.400
Horse!

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.830
Tiger!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.370
Fire Style! Fireball Jutsu!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.810
What?! That's not a Jutsu
that a Genin can do…

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.040
He shouldn't have
enough Chakra yet!

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.730
He's gone!
ls he behind me?! No, above me?!

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.160
Where is he?!

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.060
I'm under you!!

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.830
Wha--?!

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.900
Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.150
Shinobi Battle Skill ♪3, Ninjutsu.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.620
How's that? You can't move, heh?

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.360
Although, you're…already starting
to make your mark.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.490
But, oh well.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.830
They do say that the nail that sticks up
gets hammered down, so…

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.800
Damn it!

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.810
I don't have to naively take those bells.
I'll just eat in secret right now!

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.580
Let's eat!!

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.250
Hey.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.620
I was just joking…

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.820
Too late!

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.290
Darn it…! Is there this much of
a difference in strength…?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.800
Sakura...

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.270
This time it's a freshly severed head?!

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.880
What's up with her?

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.490
Sasuke?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.960
You're okay!

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.830
Hey, cut it out!
Don't cling to me!

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.530
There's not much time left until noon.
I'm going.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.900
Sasuke, you're still going
after the bells?!

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.470
I was able to touch them last time.
Next time I'll be able to take them.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.580
What?! 					I-I see.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.380
Sure enough,
you're awesome, Sasuke.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.820
There's no way I can take
the bells from Sensei.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.720
At this rate, I'll face
separation from Sasuke…

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.830
Uh…say. There's really no time left…

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.260
So let's just take it easy and
try again next time.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.830
I'm the only one
who can kill that man.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.900
Huh…? What?
You mean Sensei?

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.800
At that time…I was crying.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.040
Crying…?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.040
My…

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.950
What…? What is it…?

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.820
I'm an avenger. I must become stronger
than that man…

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.020
I don't have time for setbacks here...

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.830
...to kill a certain man!

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.000
Damn it…I wasted my time talking.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.170
Sasuke...

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.480
Oh-oh, your stomachs are growling…

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.950
By the way, about this exercise…

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.790
Well! There's no need for you guys
to go back to the Academy.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.830
What? I… All I did was lay unconscious.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.700
Is that okay?

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.840
Love is victorious!! Cha!!

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.540
Yahooooo!

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.080
Then, then!
That means the three of us…

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.810
Yes. The three of you…

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.680
must quit being Ninja!!

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.490
N-No way!

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.570
Kakashi hasn't passed
a single person this whole time…

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.030
Iruka…

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:10.070
Even I don't know if it's good for
those kids to become Shinobi right away…

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:14.650
However…
Kakashi's judgments were correct…

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.250
Quit being Ninja?! What do you mean?!

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.320
Uh, well it's true, we weren't able to
take the bells.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.790
But why do we have to be told to "quit"?!

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.830
That's because you're all squirts who
don't have the qualifications to become Ninja.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.830
Oh!

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.830
Sasuke!

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.540
I'm saying you're squirts.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.480
Don't step on Sasuke!!

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.450
Are you kids thinking that
being a Ninja is easy? Huh?

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.220
Why do you think you're doing
this exercise in teams?

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.630
Huh?! What do you mean?

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.990
Put simply…

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.330
it's as if you guys have no
understanding of the answer to this test.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.830
Answer…?

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:14.810
Yes. The answer that determines
passing or failing of this test.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.810
That's…what I've wanted to ask
about for a while now.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.410
Man, are you guys brainless or what?

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.980
Don't you get the meaning of
the three-man squad?!

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.860
Jeez!! What of three people to a squad?!

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.830
That's…teamwork!

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.260
You mean, working together?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.700
Exactly. But it's too late even
if you realize that now.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.500
You might've been able to…

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.100
take the bells if the three of you
had come at me…

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.770
Well, it's too bad.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.810
Now wait a minute.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.450
Why use teamwork if
there were only two bells?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.750
If the three of us were to desperately go
take the bells with one having to hold back,

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.820
that wouldn't be teamwork.
That'd create internal discord.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.350
Of course!

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.990
This is a test set up to purposely
place you against each other.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.960
It's under just such conditions
where one's own interests aren't the issue.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.800
The intention was to select those
who could prioritize teamwork…

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.800
Despite this, you fools…

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.870
Sakura!

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.340
You were only concerned with Sasuke and
you didn't even know where he was.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.810
And you didn't care for Naruto who was
right in front of your eyes…

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.480
Naruto!

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.320
All you do is run solo…

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:39.820
You labeled the other two as hindrances
and acted on your own…

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.130
Missions are carried out in squads!

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.560
There's no mistaking that Ninjas need
unsurpassed individual skills…

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.830
But "teamwork" is considered
more important than that.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.570
Individual actions that disrupt teamwork
throw the team into crisis and lead to death…

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.710
For example...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.650
"Sakura! Kill Naruto, or else Sasuke dies…"

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.950
What?! What?! Whaaat?!

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.350
Is what will…happen.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.420
Oh, I was so surpised.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.030
On top of having a hostage taken,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.830
you're faced with two impossible choices
and end up being killed.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.100
Every mission is
a life-risking assignment.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.840
Look at this…

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.110
The many names engraved
on this stone…

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.080
These are all Ninjas who are called
heroes in the village.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.820
That-that-that-that! I like thaaat!

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.620
I've decided now to get
my name engraved there, too!

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:49.830
A hero! A hero!
I'm not going to die like a dog!

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.830
But…they're not just ordinary heroes.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.000
No kidding. Then, what kind
of heroes are they?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.540
Hey! Hey!

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.470
They are heroes
who were killed in action.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:07.240
Killed in action?

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.610
It means they died
performing a mission.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.220
This is a memorial.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:25.230
The names of my friends
are also engraved here...

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:41.810
I'll give you guys one more chance!

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.880
However, after noon it'll be
a harsher battle to take the bell.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.820
Those who want to take on
the challenge can eat lunch.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.190
However, don't let Naruto have any.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.460
It's punishment for breaking the rules and
attempting to eat lunch on your own.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.160
If someone lets him eat…

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.830
that person will be disqualified
on the spot.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.810
I make the rules, here. Got it?!

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.810
I must be going.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.380
Listen to me, Iruka.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:16.810
What?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.320
No matter what the result,
don't hold it against Kakashi…

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:24.650
Alright.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:43.710
I'm okay with not eating lunch!
No sweat at all!

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.140
No sweat…

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.780
Here.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.790
H-Hey, Sasuke.
Sensei just said…!

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.630
It's okay.
There's no sign of him now.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.500
The three of us are going to go
take the bells together.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:10.200
It'll be trouble for me
if he becomes a hindrance, so...

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.500
Sasuke…

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.150
Sakura…

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.990
Thanks…

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.190
Don't thank me.
Just hurry up and eat.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.400
But…

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.830
I'm on…a diet…
I mean I just eat less than Sasuke.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:45.600
So you don't need to worry.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.600
But…

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:49.810
See…

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.270
Wha--?!

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.080
Hurry it up.
We don't know when he'll be back…

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.410
It's just this one time.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.120
Okay? You got it?!

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.790
I got it.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.060
You three!

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.830
Yiiikes!

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.810
You defied the rules so that
means you know what's coming…

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.710
Do you have…something to say?

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:36.120
But you see…

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.490
What?!

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.830
But! But! But!
You said, Sensei!

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.590
These guys…

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.830
We're a three-man squad, right?

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.330
That's right!
The three of us are one, so…!

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.370
That's right! That's right!
That's right!

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.940
That's right!

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.110
The three of you are one, eh…

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.820
You pass!

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:09.820
What?!

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.120
Whaaat?!

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:14.820
You pass!

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:19.160
We passed?! Why?!

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.830
You guys are the first.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.900
Up until now, it was always just dunces
who would meekly listen to what I said.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.640
A Ninja must see through deception…

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.540
In the world of Ninja,

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.580
those who break rules and codes
are branded as garbage…

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.280
But…

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.790
Those who don't cherish their friends are
garbage worse than that.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.130
He's… He's…kinda…cool…

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.830
That's it for the exercise…

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.100
Everyone passes!

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.540
Group Seven starts their mission
tomorrow!

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.440
Yes, Sir!

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.310
I did it!! I'm a Ninja!
Ninja! Ninja!

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.180
Let's go home.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.420
Cha!

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.590
I...

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.760
knew this is how it'd turn out!

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.730
Untie the rope!

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.730
Oh, please! It'd been nothing but
blah missions until now.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.800
And just when I thought I'd finally
gotten an awesome mission,

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.670
to think it'd be bodyguarding
this old man.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.810
He mocks the heck out of me,
calling me a brat.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.840
I'll tell him a thing or two.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:24.510
Someday I'll be…
Hey, are you listening?!

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.320
Next episode: "A Dangerous Mission!
Journey to the Land of Waves!"

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.820
Don't miss me kick butt!
