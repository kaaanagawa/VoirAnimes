WEBVTT

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.660
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.490
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.870
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.040
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.200
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.750
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.620
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.660
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.910
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.580
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.540
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.950
Sand Coffin!

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.790
I’ll do it.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.490
No! Please back me up.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.200
I got sand in my mouth…

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.500
P-Please let me go!

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.660
You wouldn’t be able to do
anything in your current state…

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.870
I’ll do it.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.490
Please be careful!

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.540
That guy attacks with bones!

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.040
Like earlier…

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.290
he does things like shoot bones
and extrude bones from inside his body…

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.410
He controls bones freely!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.500
Gaara of the Desert…

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.750
You use sand,
as the name implies, huh…?

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.660
Gaara vs. Kimimaro

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.540
Tough defense using sand…

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.540
He…isn’t a close-range combat type…

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.750
Getting close would be difficult, huh.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.490
It's coming!

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.000
Digital Shrapnel!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.000
There’s no waste in his movements…

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.950
Sure enough,
he’s a considerable Taijutsu user.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.490
Attack and defense are one…

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.080
He attacks and defends
with sand, huh?

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.910
However, the amount of sand
he can control is probably…

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.000
…about the amount of sand
inside the gourd.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.250
Gaara of the Desert…
A dopey nickname.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.490
You can’t do anything
if you don’t have sand.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790
Going to the trouble of walking around
carrying heavy sand

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.950
is the very proof of that.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.700
Sand Shower…

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.490
How trite…

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.620
As long as I have sand,
I can do anything.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.250
You’re the one who’s dopey…

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.490
It’s easy for me to do things
like create sand with dirt…

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.500
I get it…

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.000
With his own sand he grinds things
like rocks and minerals in dirt

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.450
and makes it into sand.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.870
So he was sending his own sand
beneath the ground

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.500
and adding new sand, huh…?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.370
Gaara of the Desert…

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.080
His nickname isn’t just for display.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.580
Excellent!

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.490
You did it!

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.490
Not yet.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.200
Sand Burial!

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.500
I’m reminded of that man
when I look at that guy.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.410
Huh?

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.330
Sasuke Uchiha!

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.250
He had the same eyes
as that guy…

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.700
The same eyes?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.080
Wanting to verify the value
of one’s own existence…

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.910
Such eyes…

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.200
Sasuke!

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.490
Sasuke!

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.490
Sasuke.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.500
You’re here, aren’t you?!
At least answer me!

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.490
What’s gotten into you?!

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.830
I don’t hate the darkness…

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.490
The darkness is where
I was brought up…

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.750
Why am I…in a place like this?

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.450
Did I do something wrong?

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.490
Is there really God…?

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.910
If there is, why confine me
in a place like this?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:24.700
Who’s there?

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.790
It doesn’t matter who I am…
Get out!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.910
Kimimaro, the time has come to use you…

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.290
Huh?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.490
For our sake,
for the Kaguya Clan…

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.490
Fight!

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.500
Yes… To fight.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.490
That is…

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.500
the only thing I can do now.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.620
N-No way…

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.620
That’s quite some pressure…

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.250
I would’ve been flattened
just like that

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.490
had I not made a membrane
of bone just below the skin.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.490
Bones…That guy’s a monster, too.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.660
It’s a troublesome body, isn’t it?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.500
I underestimated you…

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.700
But, I won’t be caught by
your sand anymore.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.410
Sand Tsunami!

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.830
Wow… It’s beyond
the scope of

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.080
escaping from the sand
or not getting caught…

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.250
To think it would change
the terrain itself…

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.040
You…You did it.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.120
Not yet.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.250
Giant Sand Burial!

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.490
H-He’s so strong…

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.120
He’s gotten even stronger
than when he fought me.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.490
But…this time for sure…

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.490
He’s a persistent guy…

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.490
Huh?!

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.490
I’m still…alive…

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.250
Then… There’s still significance
for me to live.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.490
From now, we’re going
to launch a night attack

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.700
on the Hidden Mist Village…

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.000
As they are disconcerted
from that incident,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.540
now is the perfect time for us
to make them realize our ferocity!

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:31.490
Make them realize the ferocity
of the Kaguya Clan!

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.370
– Yeah! 					– Right!

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:37.830
What’re you doing, Kimimaro?
Get going!

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.290
I don’t know what to do…

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.160
You don’t need to think
deeply about it.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.490
Go down to the Hidden Mist Village

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.750
and kill every last person
you encounter!

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.700
Just act on your instincts!

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.000
Are you of the Hidden Mist Village?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120
No…

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.490
I-I see… Excuse me!

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.830
Haku?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.490
Oh…no. It’s nothing, Zabuza.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.750
We don’t have time to be stopping.
Let’s hurry!

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.660
Right!

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.910
He had the same eyes as I…

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.540
Before I met Zabuza…

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:58.580
Hold it!

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:06.410
You’re a hasty one, aren’t you?
I’m not from this village.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.200
The thing you are after is right there…

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.330
Now, go.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.490
It seems to have begun…

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.700
The Kaguya Clan…

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:35.790
Fools who can only find
their own path of life by fighting…

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.870
It was long ago

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.580
when a simple-minded group that
just enjoyed slaughtering was acceptable.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.290
With a governed organization
as an opponent,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.450
they just become fools
rushing towards death

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.490
if they fight only with power…

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.490
Are we the only survivors…?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.950
It seems we’re surrounded…

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.580
The defense was tighter
than we thought.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.540
We have no choice…

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.540
Now it’s come to this,

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.200
take along with you
every person you can!

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.870
We’ll have them entertain us
as much as possible!

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.160
What do I fight for…?

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.370
What am I…?

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.040
Without knowing anything,
I just kept on fighting.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.910
The time has come to use you…

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.750
I’m needed…

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.200
That was the only thing
that got my body moving.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.620
And…

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.750
I was also able to figure out that…

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.410
I couldn’t live if I didn’t fight.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.120
Dawn broke…

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.490
And I learned that…

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.490
I myself was the only one
to survive.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.290
Again, I’m all alone…

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.500
By myself, I just wandered
aimlessly from place to place.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.500
This is…

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.450
The flower, from back then…?

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.160
Why are you blooming
in a place like this?

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.490
Why won’t you answer?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.080
You’re ignoring me, too, huh?!

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.080
There’s no way you’d be seen
by someone in a place like this, yet you…!

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.490
That’s enough…

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.620
Maybe…there’s no significance to living.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.490
But you might be able to
discover something interesting

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.370
by continuing to live…right?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.490
Like how you discovered that flower…

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.490
Like how I discovered you.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.000
Okay, Let’s go…

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:52.490
Back then…
Lord Orochimaru said that, but…

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.370
People are born with
some kind of significance.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.410
That’s what I think…
some kind of important mission.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.370
The mission for me…

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.160
is to protect Lord Orochimaru
and his ambition.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.910
What’s…that?!

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:36.490
Come back, Sasuke!
Everyone’s worried about you!

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.870
Damn it…
lt’s so dark I can’t see anything!

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.870
You’ve got better eyes than me.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.500
Sasuke is in the darkness now…

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:54.410
N-Neji?!

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.750
You’ll be unable to catch up
with Sasuke

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.790
if you stop in a place like this…

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.160
Neji!

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.200
Yeah… You’re right!
This isn’t the time to stop.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.080
Just wait! I’ll take Sasuke
back home no matter what!

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.870
Sasuke!

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.540
Sand Coffin!

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.160
That form…?!

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.160
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.290
And you smiled

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.700
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:35.490
In my own words

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.250
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:46.660
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:52.490
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:58.160
You listened without turning away

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.450
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:11.490
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.540
I feel so sad

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.500
But…

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.080
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.120
And you smiled

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.790
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.870
In my own words

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.490

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.120
In my own words

Brainwashed by Orochimaru…

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.910
It’s not brainwashing!
That person understands me!

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.330

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.410
