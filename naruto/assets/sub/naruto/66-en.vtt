WEBVTT

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.870
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.120
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.410
One more time

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.120
Are you really happy

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.660
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.370
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.040
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.660
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:54.910
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.990
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.990
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.120
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.990
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.990
One more time

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.580
The rules are the same as
in the preliminaries.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.040
The match goes on until one of you
dies or admits defeat.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.790
When it’s determined that
there’s a winner,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.830
the match can be stopped.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.120
But that’s my decision.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.330
Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.500
Hey Guy! You too, Lee…

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.000
Is your body all right?

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.950
Kakashi!

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.290
Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.040
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.000
You must’ve been worried.
Sorry for not contacting you at all…

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.750
Oh no, Sakura’s gonna get really mad…

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.160
I don’t really mind that.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.500
It's hard to see from here…

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.580
Sasuke…

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.870
Kakashi Sensei…

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.540
Hm?

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.660
You know about the mark
on Sasuke’s neck, don’t you?

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.700
Is that…?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.500
No need to worry.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.160
A mark?

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.990
So, that’s that.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.250
Yup!

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.990
One…

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:20.790
Two…

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.160
Three…

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.620
Four…

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.700
Five…

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.950
Six…

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.580
Seven…

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.040
Eight.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.790
Eight of them…

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.200
There are eight members of
Anbu Black Ops in this spacious arena…

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.370
Two platoons are too few…

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.620
What’s Lord Hokage thinking?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.000
Well…without knowing how or when
the opponent would make their move…

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.750
It can’t be helped that the Anbu
are dispersed and deployed

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.830
in important areas in the village.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.040
Huh?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.410
It’s about to begin.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.410
We shouldn’t let our guard down,
but for now…

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.990
We need to pay attention…
 to this match.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.830
Kakashi, I’ll be carefully checking out
what sort of training you gave him…

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.910
as your eternal rival!

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.700
Huh? Did you say something?

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.330
No! You’re slick, Kakashi!

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.370
Why are you always so avant-garde?!

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.200
Both of you, to the middle!

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.870
Begin!

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.990
So this is the sand
Kakashi told me about…

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.160
Please don’t get so mad…

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.990
Mother…

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.830
What’s he talking about…?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.990
Earlier… Earlier I had you suck
awful-tasting blood.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.660
I’m sorry.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.120
But this time it’ll likely…

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.450
taste good.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.040
His conversation’s started.
This is dangerous.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.660
This is the first time I’ve seen Gaara
get like that before fighting.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.990
So it must mean his opponent
is that imposing…

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.290
Him.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.410
It appears he’s calmed down.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.790
Come on.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.990
Hey…

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.080
Do you remember…
what he said yesterday?

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.990
At that time…

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.990
I will kill…you all without fail.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.500
Just wait.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.750
That’s what he said…

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:55.450
But he didn’t do it.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.700
It was the perfect opportunity, but…

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.700
he didn’t even see us.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.500
Now, let me feel it!

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.370
We're…

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.250
unsatisfactory for him.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.990
Right now, the only one who
can make him feel anything…

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.330
…is only Sasuke!

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.540
I live fighting for only myself
and loving myself…

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.160
And if I see that all other people
in this world

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.200
exist only to make me realize that,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.250
there could be no world more wonderful.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.990
Naruto…

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.990
Here we go!

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.580
The Sand Shield became
a Sand Clone!

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.990
He’s fast! This guy…
is just like that guy…

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.410
He’s fast! It’s nearly the same
as Lee’s ordinary speed.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.700
And…

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.330
It's overlapping with the image…

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.990
of my Taijutsu!

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.200
Is that the Sand Armor?

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.200
Come on!

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.910
Thank you, Anbu man.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.040
So apparently, Hinata will be
all right for now if she rests.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.410
Oh, is that right?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.290
Huh? You know this person?
What‘re you taking about?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.080
This person is an Anbu…

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.790
Not that, but at the examination…?
What do you mean?

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.750
Well, this is what it means…

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.990
Come on!

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.580
If you’re not gonna come at me,
I’ll go at you!

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.620
He’s fast!

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.990
What’s the matter? Is that it?

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.870
A-Amazing…

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.080
That armor…I’ll tear it off.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:07.540
His speed is basically the same
as Lee’s with the weights removed.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.080
It’s… It’s exactly like
Lee’s Taijutsu.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.830
His speed is also completely
different from before!

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.910
Sasuke… You are indeed
a genius beyond imagination.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.450
How many years did it take me
to attain that speed…?

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.990
And you attained it in a mere month…!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.830
However, it seems to consume
a lot of stamina

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.990
to continue that movement.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.450
What’s Gaara planning to do?

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.580
The sand armor uses up too
much Chakra…

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.370
It can’t last for very long.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.330
What the heck sort of training
did you do?!

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.290
Hm?

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.830
To get to that level in a mere month…

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.790
Sasuke had copied Lee’s Taijutsu
with Sharingan.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.410
So during the Taijutsu training…

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.580
I had Sasuke image Lee’s movements.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.620
Sasuke could make
that movement his own

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.750
only because he knew Lee.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:50.700
Of course, Sasuke had to
work very hard for it.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.750
But…with only that…

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.950
With only Taijutsu…
that Sand guy can’t be taken down!

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.990
That Kakashi…

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.990
He must have seen the battle

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.990
between the hateful Gaara
and the lovable Lee.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.750
Taijutsu that was taught suddenly

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.950
can’t work against an opponent
that even Lee couldn’t take down.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.990
He should have known this only to well.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.540
So if that’s the case…

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.040
Why is it that he had Sasuke
master only Taijutsu?!

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.370
Why did I keep living?

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.160
But as long as you’re alive,
you need a reason…

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.250
If you don’t have one,
it’s just the same as being dead.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.290
What's this guy saying?!

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.000
So this is the answer I came to…

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.750
I am living in order to kill
human beings other than myself.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.750
After living in the fear of never knowing
when I might be murdered,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.790
finally, I became calm.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.540
Oh?

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.200
Shikamaru…

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.990
We need to go over to where
Kakashi Sensei is right now!

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.370
What’re you planning to do?

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.660
Hey!

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.990
I'm going to…

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.990
stop this match!

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.660
Gaara couldn’t possibly be planning
to use that Jutsu!

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.990
So he used all the sand for protection…

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.870
I didn’t think there could be this
much of a difference in the hardness

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.950
with a difference in the density
of the sand.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.080
So it’s absolute protection.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.870
The sand…
lt’s covered his entire body.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.990
This is somewhat troublesome.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.990
Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.870
Kakashi Sensei!

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:25.620
Naruto!

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.750
Huh? What do you want?

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.660
Sensei!
Please stop this match right away!

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.410
That guy is totally different from us!

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.990
He’s not normal!

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.330
Naruto… 					What’re you saying?

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.790
He lives to kill people.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.990
In any case…

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.250
If this continues, Sasuke will die!

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.990
Jin, Saru,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.990
Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru…

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.950
There’s no mistake about it.
lt’s that Jutsu!

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.620
This isn’t good!
Our plan isn’t even on Gaara’s mind.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.660
Shoot!

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.040
Kakashi Sensei!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:29.120
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:40.450
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:56.120
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.250
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.580
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.830
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:21.990
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:32.790
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:43.330
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.990
Forge on strong

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.870
Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.410
Even if one understands visually,

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.290
it's meaninless unless one
can move physically.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.200
I was filled with
a sense of superiority.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.910
But now, you have a body that moves
at the same high speed as mine.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.660
