WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.030
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.660
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.660
Now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.790
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.360
Sasuke!

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.230
Naruto’s certainly different
from you, Sasuke.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.640
He’s a klutz and kind of gets in the way.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
But he’s not in the least a coward!

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.210
Right? Isn’t that’s right?!

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.310
Sasuke!

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.030
You foolish little brother.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.800
If you want to kill me, resent me,
 hate me and…

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.630
continue to live your ugly life.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.540
No...

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.810
Flee.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.410
Flee and hang on to your life.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.480
No!

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.990
No!

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.560
The Sharingan Revived:
Dragon-Flame Jutsu!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.330
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan…

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.070
His blood has begun to stir...

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.270
I should take my time and
confirm his true power.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.650
I have to live so I can kill
my older brother…

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.580
That’s what I thought.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.790
But it’s me who was being stupid.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.250
Naruto!

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.990
Sakura!

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.820
How can someone who can’t put
his life on the line at a place like this...

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.930
beat that man?!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.650
I can see.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:17.640
I can see!

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.610
I can see you!

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.660
It’s pretty good…

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.970
You foretell my movements and
your aim is sure.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.640
You can see my moves, can’t you?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.320
The sun will set soon…

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.420
I must find him quickly!

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.760
It will become completely dark
and my disadvantage will increase.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.100
But why in the world right now…
what’s his goal?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.670
Well, that’s fine…

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.840
He came to this village.
I’ll settle this here and now.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.650
I got you!

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.650
A substitution!

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.940
Sasuke!

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.580
Humph! 					You are too easy.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.210
The Uchiha name is crying.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.780
That’s okay.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.290
I’ll just take my time and play
with you before I’ll kill you.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.360
Like a worm.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.940
This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.750
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.670
He did it!

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.660
Sasuke!

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:01.690
You did it!

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.560
Are you okay?

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.500
Hang on.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.080
Paralysis?

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.320
I didn’t expect that you could use
Sharingan this much at your age.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.760
You are truly a member
of the Uchiha clan.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.990
I do want you, after all.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.670
You’re definitely his brother.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.640
Your eyes hide more ability
than that Itachi.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.910
Who in the world are you?

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.650
My name is Orochimaru…

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:05.660
If you think you want to meet me again,
desperately run to the top of this test.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.190
– The Scroll!
– Defeat the three...

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.660
Sound Village Ninja
under my control.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.530
You are not making sense at all!

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.640
We don’t want to see
your face ever again, got it?!

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.370
That won’t do.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.510
Sasuke!

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.670
Sasuke!

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:52.000
You, what did you do to Sasuke?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.910
I gave him a parting gift.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.210
Sasuke absolutely would
come look for me…

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.450
looking for power.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.420
I enjoyed seeing your various powers.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.330
Sasuke!

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.630
Hold on, Sasuke.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.100
C'mon!

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.850
Sasuke...

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.990
Sasuke, c’mon!

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.790
Sasuke...

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.460
Sasuke...

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.560
Naruto!

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.670
Sasuke’s... Sasuke’s...!

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.070
Naruto!

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.790
What?

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.660
What should I do?

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.450
I can feel it!

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:05.270
He’s close by.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.990
It’s been a while...

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.960
Anko.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.060
You’re level S class,

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.400
an extremely dangerous person on
the most wanted list.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.640
That’s why I’ll kill you here
even if it costs my life.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.310
That is my duty as
your former subordinate

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.580
who learned it all from you.
lsn’t that right, Orochimaru?!

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.910
No, you can’t.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.730
Striking Shadow Snake!

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.640
I won’t let you escape.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.300
I got you.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.030
Orochimaru,
 I’m gonna borrow your left hand.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.070
This hand sign…

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.870
Right… you and I are going to die here.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:56.280
Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.620
You intend to commit suicide?

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.460
Substitution.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.090
As you are a Special Jonin
of the village,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.290
you can’t be just using
the forbidden Jutsu I taught you.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.660
I told you it wouldn’t work.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.640
Why have you come now?

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.280
It’s our reunion after so long,
and you’re awfully cold.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.950
Don’t tell me that you came
to assassinate Lord Hokage?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.660
No, no…

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.660
I don’t have enough
subordinates for that yet…

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.460
I’ve heard of the excellence ones of
this village and thought I’d put dibs on it.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.000
A little while ago,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.640
I gave that same Curse Mark
as a present.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.910
There’s a kid that I want.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.210
Selfish as always.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.020
That kid will die.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.850
Certainly… the odds are 1 in 10
that he’ll die,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.860
but he may survive just like you did.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.560
This kid, you really like him, huh?

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.660
Are you jealous?.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:54.970
Hey...

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.870
Are you still holding a grudge
that I used you and threw you away?

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.910
Unlike you, that kid will excel.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.080
For one thing he inherited
the Uchiha ability.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.490
He has beautiful features and is
a vessel who can become my heir.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.720
If that kid lived,
it will make things interesting.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.030
Be sure not to cancel this test.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.170
Three people from my village
are also under your care.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.700
Make me enjoy it.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.480
If something happens to
deprive me of my fun,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.080
consider it the end of Leaf Village.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.400
We’ve secured food and water after
spending half a day

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.770
and now most teams have halted activity.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.770
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.770
We'll split up into three and go scouting.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.640
However, whether we find
other teams or not,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.350
we return to this place.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:17.280
Got it?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.650
Okay.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.780
Roger.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:21.420
Okay.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:22.490
Scatter!

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.100
His breathing is gradually
getting regular…

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.700
but he still has a terrible fever.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.150
I have to protect them both.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.970
I have to communicate this
to Lord Hokage right away.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.570
Cripes! At a time like this!

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.570
T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.500
So you are here, Anko.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.320
You’re pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:34.850
Well, don’t say that.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.960
Are you okay, hey?

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.490
Huh? T-This is...!

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.100
The Curse Mark is appearing…

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.770
Don’t tell me…?!

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.670
Is it Orochimaru?

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.040
What, really?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.410
Now that it’s come to this,
we’ll take you to Lord Hokage.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.640
No, take me to the tower.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.410
What are you saying?

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.780
The moment Orochimaru comes
to this village,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.580
a strict alert is issued.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.150
It’s more urgent than
continuing the Exam.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:09.590
I know…

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.530
Anyway, I’ll tell the whole story later,
so please call for Lord Hokage.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.040
I found you.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.580
As Orochimaru ordered,
we’ll wait for daybreak to do it.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.450
Sasuke Uchiha is our target,
not the other.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.650
If they come in the way,
 it’s okay to kill the other two, right?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:42.690
Of course.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.190
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:31.430
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:40.940
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:49.320
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.230
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.030
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.670
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:12.640
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.080
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.650
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.460
Just sing.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.700
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.030
The two are one

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:40.500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.980
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.650
The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village,
Rock Lee, is here!

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.750
Yeah, I did it!
I did it, Guy Sensei!

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.120
