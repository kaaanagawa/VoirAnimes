WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.250
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.420
Withdraw! You’re not suited
to being a Shinobi.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.830
You don’t have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.400
Hinata, give it to him!

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.500
Naruto…

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.740
Don’t just take it! Argue back!

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.270
I’m getting irritated watching this!

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.950
Naruto...

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.650
Thank you!

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.550
The expression of her eyes
has changed...

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.890
So you're not going to withdraw?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.520
I’m not taking responsibility
for what happens…

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.730
I don’t want to run away!

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.500
Byakugan!

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.930
Brother Neji! I challenge you!

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.150
Here!

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.560
A Failure Stands Tall!

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.570
As I thought, this is the extent of it…

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.540
the head family’s power!

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.840
What the--?!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.010
But Hinata laid a perfect strike!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.050
N-Not yet…

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.730
What's with this guy…!

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.560
I-It can't be….

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.770
Well, now….

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.770
I guess this is why he's called
the most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.690
Y-You mean… All this time…?

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.560
That's right! I can see
the Chakra Points.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.600
W-What is he talking about?!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.800
On the Chakra Network…

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.510
there are 361 energy centers
or Chakra opening,

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.510
each about the size
of the head of a pin.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.840
They're called Chakra Points.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:07.720
Theoretically, hitting one directly
can halt or increase Chakra flow,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.560
enabling one to gain complete control over
an opponent's flow of Chakra.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.590
Just so you know,

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.500
not even my Sharingan
can see Chakra Points!

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.530
Having the penetrating eye
is one thing,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.540
but to hit it so accurately like
that during a match,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.540
well, that's just…

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.180
Lady Hinata...

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.190
What we have here is an unchangeable
difference in abilities.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.260
It's what distinguishes
the elite from the failure.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.560
It is brute, unalterable fact.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.070
You were destined to regret having said

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.540
that you don't want to run anymore,
 the instant you said it.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.340
And now, you must have
abandoned yourself to despair!

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.110
This is your ultimatum…

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.650
Withdraw!

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.180
I-I...

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
I-I meant it...

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.430
and am…sticking by…

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.530
every word...

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.770
Hinata…

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.670
I said!

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.540
I'm not gonna run away!

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.180
Because that's…my Way of Ninja!

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.440
I had no idea... Hinata was this tough…

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.750
She's a lot like you.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.520
Come to think of it…
She's always watching you.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.180
Huh?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.890
Hinata…

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.570
Bring it on!

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.810
She has reached her limit.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.180
One more blow and…

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.130
Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.130
have completely halted
her flow of Chakra.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.530
That means she can no longer
send Chakra

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.170
into her opponent's body
to fight in the Gentle Fist.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.540
This match is as good as over.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.680
But I never imagined there would
be someone this powerful…

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.550
I'm afraid even our Sasuke
is no match for him.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.350
It looks as if Neji may very well
take this Exam.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.560
It's going to take more than what
this girl has to bring him down.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.670
L-Look at those eyes…

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.980
Is he going to try to kill her?
No, no, that's absurd.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.610
Doesn't it seem that…

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.550
Neji’s strength is somehow
against the rules?

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.480
He's just too powerful…

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.850
I mean it!

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.390
Go, Hinata!

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.760
Naruto...

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.560
Strength has come back
into her eyes…

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.300
I've been watching you…

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.610
I've been watching you closely
for many years now!

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:31.550
Why I wonder…?

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.720
Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.460
What a pain!

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.430
It's all your fault!

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.930
Like I care!

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.600
Okay!

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.270
Naruto… d-do your best.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.840
Transformation!

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.680
I don't know why, but…

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.520
I am Naruto Uzumaki!

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.590
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you!

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.560
Is that perfectly clear?!

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.470
I'm not about to lose to
the likes of any of you? Yeah, right!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.710
That idiot.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.310
He made a roomful of enemies
in the space of an instant.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.180
When I watch Naruto...

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.550
Naruto, stand up!

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.570
If you compete with me
for the name of Hokage…

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.540
You… will be the loser!

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.270
I can feel courage welling up.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:08.110
I feel that I can hang on,
that I can do it…

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.920
that I too am worth something!

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:16.890
Oh!

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.320
– No! 					– Hinata!

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.800
Hinata...

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.770
At some point, Hinata, who was
in the habit of just giving up,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.340
made up her mind to change.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.380
Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.820
She put every ounce of
her being into her training.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.750
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.300
But even so, she continued
to fail all her missions.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.610
She lost her nerve when
faced with real competition

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.970
and became easily discouraged.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.550
But today's Hinata is different.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.020
I have never…

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.390
seen…that look in her eyes before.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.060
Naruto.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.030
I have always done
the watching up to now,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.100
but, now, finally…

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.570
finally, I am…

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:36.100
Naruto!

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.980
You just don't get it, do you?

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.620
Your strikes were ineffective
from the very first.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.990
It's the end.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.560
Hinata… That's enough.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.760
You lost the match,

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.570
but you've become a new person
in the process.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.800
You did well.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.540
I want to change that about myself…

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.340
So I proposed it myself…

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.620
Neji's final blow went
straight for the heart.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.490
I feel sorry for her,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.550
but she won't be standing
again now.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.540
As further fighting is not feasible
under these conditions…

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.510
Don't stop it!

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.180
Don't stop the match!
Believe it!

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:30.710
Naruto, stop!

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.550
What on earth are you saying, stupid!

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.550
She's had it. You can see
she's unconscious…

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.350
Huh?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.400
Why do you stand up?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.540
If you continue like this,
you’ll really die!

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.270
He is now finally for
the first time truly seeing me.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.680
I will not be caught looking bad...

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.650
Why?!

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.150
in front of...

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.750
the person I admire most.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.260
I-I am far from finished!

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:55.670
Give up the bravado…

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.240
I can tell you're just
barely standing.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.540
You've shouldered the lot
of having been born

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.880
to the head family line of the Hyuga…

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:09.880
And cursed and blamed
yourself for being weak...

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.480
But, people cannot change.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.390
That's just the way it is.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.820
There is no need for you
to suffer any more!

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.460
Surrender to it!

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.760
You're wrong... Brother Neji.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.600
Because I can tell…

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.540
that you are suffering
much more than I.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:34.910
What?!

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.540
You are the one who is torn up

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.550
over the fate of head
and branch family.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.560
Neji, the match has been called!

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.520
Oh boy!

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.540
Neji, get a hold of yourself!

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.910
You promised me

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.310
you wouldn't let the head family
thing get you riled up!

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.980
Why are all the other Jonin
butting in?!

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.180
The head family gets
special treatment, eh?

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.550
Hinata?!

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:23.150
Hinata!

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.190
Hinata!

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.960
Hinata!

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.030
Hinata! Are you okay?!

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.260
Hey!

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.900
Naruto…

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.000
Yeah.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.540
I…

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.150
Do you think…

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.850
I…changed maybe a little bit?

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.560
Hey you, failure!

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.060
I have two pieces
of advice for you.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:08.430
First, if you intend to
call yourself a Shinobi,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.400
stop that revolting cheering of yours.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.070
And the second...

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.710
a failure will always be a failure.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.580
There's no changing that!

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.610
Do you want to see about that?

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.830
You!

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.960
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.470
But all fighting must be
done officially in a match!

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.610
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.540
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.810
Though, I am probably going
to be the one fighting Neji…

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.220
but it would be okay with me
if you ended up fighting him, Naruto.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.960
All right already.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.000
So this is okay then,
right, Guy Sensei?

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.530
Lee! You….

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:19.940
Nice going!

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.420
Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.120
Was he trying to kill her then?!

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.560
The precious little time you have
would be better spent

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.960
seeing to her than glaring at me.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:46.960
Medics!

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.570
Hurry! What's taking so long?!

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.770
S-Sorry.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.540
Get her on the stretcher.
One, two, three.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.440
It's serious. She 's got about
10 minutes at the most!

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.710
Get her to the emergency room.
Pronto!

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.980
Out of the way!

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.370
Hinata…

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.850
Because that's my Way of Ninja.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.560
I promise you.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.220
I will win no matter what!

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.560
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:32.970
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:42.550
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:50.850
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.560
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:01.630
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.440
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:14.240
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.620
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.190
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.960
Just sing.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:33.460
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.570
The two are one

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:42.010
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.540
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.020
The Absolute Defense of the Sand?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.720
They say no one has
ever injured Gaara.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.420
He's strong as heck and
has no weak points.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.760
Bushy-Brows is no match for him…

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.730
But wait, he's not losing!

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.700
He seems a lot faster than before.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.560
Is this due to his training?

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.670
I am getting excited about it!

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.500
Next episode: "Gaara vs. Rock Lee:
The Power of Youth Explodes!"

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.670
I'm just a little envious of that training.
