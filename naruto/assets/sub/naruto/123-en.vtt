00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.680
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.590
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.890
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.050
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.220
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.760
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.640
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.680
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.930
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.600
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:28.590
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.590
The Leaf's Handsome Devil!

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.550
Blast!

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.590
No matter how many times you try…

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.050
it’s the same!

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.100
I’ll acknowledge you.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.590
You’re not only sharp…

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.590
You’re also very determined…

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.590
In addition, I’m nice, too…

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.640
Striking a helpless woman
is against my policy…

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.470
But however I look at it,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.430
you don’t have the feel of
a helpless woman…

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.930
in your case!

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.720
Don’t be getting full of yourself

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.260
just because you released
the Genjutsu, you little clod…!

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.050
She’s still not completely bound.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.470
Damn it…

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.550
I can’t lose!

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.680
A little more…

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.640
What Chakra she has?!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.680
Even if I bind her
at point-blank range,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.590
she still pushes back…

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.590
But , I’ll get hammered
for sure if I let go now.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.800
After all, I just have to put this
to rest with this Jutsu.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.760
Hang in there, Akamaru!

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.720
Damn it… What’s going on?!

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.300
Damn it!

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.890
One more…to go…

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.300
This guy’s crazy strong…

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.590
Not a single hit with that
many shadow clones…

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.550
It’s about time…

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.680
I’ve been eagerly waiting.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.300
Lord Orochimaru’s ambition…
The first step…

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.930
Sasuke…

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.590
Sasuke! What’re you doing
with these guys?!

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.720
Come on! We’re going home now!

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:31.680
Sasuke…

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.600
Hey…

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.720
Should we go home?

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.970
Yeah!

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.350
We’ve both made it to the top!

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.970
I want to fight you too.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.720
Hey… We’re going home.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.430
Everyone’s worried about you.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.590
So…

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.590
Sasuke!

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.890
Please. Bring back Sasuke…!

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.590
You can hear my voice, can’t you?!

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.590
Wait, Sasuke!

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:45.760
It’s futile…

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.550
Die.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.010
Who’re you?

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.510
The rejuvenated…

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.260
Leaf Village’s Handsome Devil…

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.680
Rock Lee!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.640
B-Bushy Brow…?

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.590
Bushy Brow, you!
What about your body…?

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.590
More importantly, Naruto.
Go get Sasuke.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.600
But…you…

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.970
Please leave this person to me!

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.850
This guy’s…good…

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.720
Bushy Brow! Be careful!
He uses his own bones to attack.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.010
Bones…you say…?

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.680
He’s crazy strong…

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.510
What’re you doing?!
Please go, quickly!

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.390
Naruto…

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.590
You also promised Sakura
with a “nice-guy pose,” right?!

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.590
I’ll bring back Sasuke, no matter what!

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.010
It’s a promise of a lifetime!

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.890
This person…I’ll beat him!

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.050
I promise!

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.430
Right!

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.720
I won’t let you!

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.590
Die.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.180
Please don’t ignore me!

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.590
Oh…

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.590
Bushy Brow…

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.300
You don’t have the time
to be inattentive!

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.590
Good response!

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.600
However…

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.720
If Sasuke is inside that coffin…

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.600
It’d be totally impossible to take them
on with a Genin team…

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.800
We Jonin are in this plight….

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.590
We should organize a special team
and send them out for backup.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.390
We can’t do that…

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.510
Ever since Orochimaru’s attack,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.430
the Leaf is currently losing strength
as a great land.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.800
You understand that the Jonin
and Chunin are being totally mobilized

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.390
in order to take out possible domestic
and international dangers.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.800
Even if the Sharingan were to fall
into Orochimaru’s hands…

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.600
We should now prioritize
avoiding war with other lands.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:02.350
But… I’m sure the Orochimaru situation
isn’t a problem that can be deferred forever.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.680
If he regains power…
He’ll promptly attack again…

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.260
I know…

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.260
I’m not such a fool.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.350
I was sure to think about it and
measures have already been taken.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.600
In here!

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.220
What’s wrong, Guy?
You’re on the brink of exhaustion.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.140
Did something happen
on your mission?

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.590
No… I took care of the mission
and ran back with all of my might…

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.600
More importantly…

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.590
Lee! What happened with
Lee’s surgery?!

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.590
It was a success.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:04.100
He can start training starting tomorrow
if it’s just for Jutsu.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.890
Well, bed rest for a while
would be best though.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.590
Th-There’s trouble, Lady Fifth Hokage.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.930
Rock Lee is gone!

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.930
No!

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.930
Next will be the end.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.970
Damn it… Last night while
I treated Genma and Raido?

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.590
Lee…

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.260
That fool… He went after them.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.510
And…he must’ve been really flustered…

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.430
He took my bottle of sake for
a bottle of medicine by mistake….

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:48.680
SAKE

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.590
Sake?!

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.510
Uh…Uh-oh…

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.720
What’s wrong, Guy?

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.930
Actually, when Lee drinks even
a little bit of alcohol…

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.010
Things get…so messy…

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.470
Get so messy?

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.590
Severe Leaf Hurricane!

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.390
He’s agile… My kicks don’t hit.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.260
You’re flexible to
a surprising extent…

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.890
And you make unique movements, eh?

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.850
You’re too…straight forward.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.590
It’s over…

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.550
Please wait!

00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.970
I’m sorry.
lt’s about time for my medicine!

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.050
I have to be sure to drink it, so…

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.260
Excuse me a moment.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.050
I’ve always disliked medicine.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.010
It…happened before when
I took him to a restaurant

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.470
to celebrate his acquisition
of the “Hidden Lotus.”

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.970
Lee mistook my sake for water…

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.890
As soon as he drank just
a small cup…

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.680
of the sake, things got ugly…

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.300
Got ugly…?

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.300
After a silence that was like
right before a storm…

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.760
The moment I realized it,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.600
the restaurant…

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.640
had gotten all messed up…

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.930
Medicine always tastes stran…

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:03.010
What…? What did this guy drink?

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.010
Messed up?
What do you mean?

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.220
He’s terribly….!

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.760
Lady Tsunade… Lee goes into

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.590
an incredible drunken frenzy!

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.350
Huh…?

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.590
Who the heck are you?! Hey!

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.930
Geez, who are you anyway?

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.010
Acting cool… So irritating…

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.590
Hence, he’s a natural user of…

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.640
Drunken Fist!

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.010
Sasuke!

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.930
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.050
And you smiled

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.590
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:35.470
In my own words

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:41.010
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.590
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:52.260
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.930
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:04.220
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:11.300
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:14.550
I feel so sad

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.510
But…

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.640
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.970
And you smiled

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.470
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.640
In my own words

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.010
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.510
And you smiled

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.760
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.760
In my own words

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.590
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.590
You fell for it, didn’t you?!

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.350
How about my strategy?

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.350
This is the Shinobi Secret
of reading the double bluff!

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.590
Guy Sensei! I did it once again!
Yeah!

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.260
But, what’s this?!
The world is oddly…

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.600
f-floating,
and I’ve no inclination of losing!

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.100
Next episode: “The Beast Within.”
