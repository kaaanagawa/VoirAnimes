WEBVTT

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.860
C'mon!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.930
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.200
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.610
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.580
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.250
For no single one,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.920
To none does belong,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.190
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.000
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.500
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.800
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.270
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.820
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.350
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.920
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.960
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.070
Rockin' my heart

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.500
This is quite some fog.
I can't see ahead.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750
The bridge should be visible soon.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.520
When we reach the side of the bridge,
we'll be in the Land of the Waves.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.280
Wooow! 					 It's huge!

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.880
H-Hey! 					Please keep it down.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.680
I took this boat out under cover of fog.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.820
And I cut the engine
and am rowing by hand.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.120
If they find us,
we'll be in deep trouble.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.060
Mr. Tazuna.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.340
I want to ask you something
before we arrive at the pier.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.080
The identity of your assailants,
and the reason why they are after you.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.080
If you don't tell us…

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.820
our mission may end
when you make landfall.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.530
The Assassin of the Mist

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.110
It appears I have no choice
but to tell you.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.150
Frankly, I'd like you to listen.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.880
Just as you said,

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.090
this may be beyond
the scope of your mission.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.960
Actually, I am being targeted
by a terrifying man.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.630
A terrifying man?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.000
Who?

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.900
You guys have probably heard at
 least his name before.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.840
A shipping magnate
by the name of Gato.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.080
What? Gato…of the Gato Company?

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.480
One of the world's richest men?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.820
Who? What?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.590
Yes…

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.460
On the surface, he's the chief executive
of a shipping company…

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.760
But underneath,
he is into drug-trafficking

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.830
and deals in contraband
using gangs and Ninjas.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.440
Moreover, he runs a despicable business,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.110
ruthlessly taking over nations
and enterprises.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.810
It was about one year ago…

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.620
when that man first set his eyes on
the Land of the Waves…

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.650
He used his wealth and violence
to enter this country,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.290
and before anyone knew it,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.360
he had taken complete control of the island's
maritime transportation and shipping.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.030
Having a tight grip on the ocean, in an
island nation like the Land of the Waves,

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.370
means having control of finance,
the government, the people... everything.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.810
The one thing Gato fears...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.150
is the completion of the bridge...

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.780
that has been under construction
for some time now.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.820
I see.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.790
Since you're the one building the bridge,
you've become a hindrance.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.830
Then, those Ninjas from before
were Gato's men…?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.400
But I don't understand.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.570
Your opponent is a dangerous one,
 who will even use Ninja.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.640
Why did you hide that fact from us
when you made your request?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.140
The Land of the Waves…

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.520
is a very poor nation,
and even feudal lords have no money.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.820
Of course, we ordinary citizens
have no money either.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.790
We cannot afford to make requests of
Rank B or higher...

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.370
Well, if you pull out
of the mission when I land ashore,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.340
I will, no doubt, be killed.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.440
Killed sometime before I make it home.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.810
But there's no need for concern!

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.610
Should I die, my cute grandchild
who will turn eight...

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.820
will only cry his heart out!

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.450
Oh!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.860
And... my daughter will only blame
the Hidden Leaves Ninja

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.490
for the rest of her life
and grieve in solitude!

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.830
Oh, it's not your fault at all!

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.770
Well...

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.140
I guess we have no choice.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.940
Let's continue as his bodyguards.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.780
Oh! I am most grateful!

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.450
I won!

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.820
We'll be arriving soon.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:31.900
Tazuna.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.030
It appears we haven't been noticed
up until this point…

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.830
Thanks.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.810
This is as far as I go.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.080
See you around.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.910
Yeah. You've been a big help.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.820
Be careful.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.060
Okay!

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:41.630
Get me home safely.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.930
Right.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.040
When they next attack,
it won't be Chunin, but elite level Jonin.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.280
Cripes!

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.320
I won't let this guy do
all the fun stuff anymore!

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.200
There!

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.480
Heh… Just a mouse.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.810
Quit trying to show off!

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.120
There was nothing there
 in the first place!

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.820
Please, Naruto.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.620
Don't use Kunai Knives recklessly.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.820
They're really dangerous.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.830
Hey brat!
Don't be doing anything confusing!

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.160
Huh? I sense a presence there!

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.960
No, over here?!

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:49.830
There!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.700
Stop it, already!

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.980
S-Someone's really been targeting us
 the whole time!

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.410
Yeah right!

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.820
Knock it off, you!

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.190
Naruto!
What have you done?!

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.590
It's a bunny!

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.090
I'm sorry.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.260
I didn't mean to…
I'm sorry, bunny.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.830
It's just a rabbit, eh.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.400
That's a snow rabbit.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.810
But that doesn't explain
its fur color...

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.810
The coat turns white only during winter
when there is little sunlight.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.960
Which means...

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:51.130
that snow rabbit was raised indoors
without sunlight to be used as a substitution.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.270
Guess they're already here…

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.940
I'm sorry…

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:10.080
I see… The Demon Brothers wouldn't
be enough to take on these guys.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.450
The Copy Ninja from the
Village of the Hidden Leaves.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.190
"Sharingan" Kakashi is with them…

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.890
Everyone, get down!

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.420
If I'm not mistaken, he's…

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.520
Here we go!

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.360
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.160
I'm going to do it this time.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.200
I won't lose to Sasuke!

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.930
Well, well.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.900
If it isn't the Rogue Ninja
of the Hidden Mist, Zabuza Momochi!

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.370
Rogue Ninja? Whatever.
What's important now is…

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.040
Ready…

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.780
Go!

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:15.250
You're in the way.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.480
Get back, you guys.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.650
Why?!

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.090
He's on a totally different level from
the guys from the other day.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.590
His being our opponent means…

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:28.830
Huh?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.830
Oh.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.700
that things might be tricky
as I am now.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.400
I assume you are Kakashi,
the Sharingan user…

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.440
Sorry, but…

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.240
I'll have you hand over the old man.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.200
Huh? Huh? Sharingan?
What's that?

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.130
What? What is he talking about?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.070
Is this guy strong?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.540
Sharingan…

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.810
Get in Manji battle formation, you guys.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.270
Protect Tazuna…

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.810
Don't involve yourselves in the fight.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:21.510
Huh?

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.580
That's the teamwork
in this situation.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.750
Huh?!

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.590
Fight me.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.830
W-What's this eye…?

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.830
Well now...

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.570
I never expected to see
the rumored Sharingan this soon…

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.800
This is an honor.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.810
Everyone's been saying Sharingan...

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.810
What is it?!

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:52.980
…Sharingan.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.810
Power that the light of the eye generates,
and the pupil emanates.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.020
The user of
the so-called Visual Jutsu (Art)

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.820
is said to possess the vision to see through
all Genjutsu (Illusionary Art),

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.190
Taijutsu (Physical Art),
and Ninjutsu (Ninja Art),

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.190
and is able to deflect them.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.430
The Sharingan is a type of eye
that is unique

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.400
to the user of the Visual Art.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.740
However, that is not the only power of
the Sharingan.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.810
Well said.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.810
That is not all.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.520
What's more frightening is that
such an eye

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.250
can assess an opponent's techniques
and copy them.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.830
When I was in the Anbu Black Ops
of the Hidden Mist,

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.130
search information
about you was in the Bingo Book

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.800
I would carry around with me.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:56.370
There was also something
else in the book...

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.210
About the man who has copied
over one thousand skills…

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.150
Kakashi the Copy Ninja.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.820
What? Kakashi Sensei
is that incredible a Ninja?

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.360
W-Wow!

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:18.830
What does this mean?

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.000
The Sharingan…is a special trait

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.000
that appears in only a select few
even among the Uchiha clan.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.110
Could it be, that this guy…

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.840
Let's end the talking here.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.810
I must kill that old man immediately.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.830
But, Kakashi, it seems
I have to defeat you first.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.440
Over there!

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.610
And he's even on the water?

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.520
He's building up quite a bit of Chakra!

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.700
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.610
He's vanished?!

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.810
Sensei!

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.820
He'll probably come to erase me first…

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.020
What is he?

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.820
Zabuza Momochi.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.720
He's a Anbu Black Ops member
in the Hidden Mist and

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.590
is known as "the silent killing"
technique expert.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.830
S-Silen...?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.730
As the name suggests…

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.830
it's a killing skill that's implemented
in an instant in silence.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:11.810
By the time you realize it,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.880
it's possible you may find yourself
in the afterlife.

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.910
I haven't totally mastered
the use of my Sharingan.

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.280
So don't lower your guard, you guys.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.360
Well, if we fail, we'll only die.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.190
How can you be so carefree?!

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.000
The mist is steadily getting thicker!

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.810
The Land of the Waves
is surrounded by ocean.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.410
So mist rises very easily.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:48.410
Sensei!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.120
Eight spots.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.030
Huh? What?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.160
The larynx, the spine,
the lungs, the liver...

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.400
The jugular and the subclavian veins.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.040
The kidneys, the heart.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:16.170
Now then, which vulnerable spot
would be good?

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.540
What an intense thirst for blood!

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.740
If I take even one breath,
or move my eyes,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.410
I will be marked and killed -
that's what I'm feeling.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.380
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad!

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.190
Facing a Jonin's intent to kill…

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.220
This sensation is like having
my life being held in limbo…

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.830
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:15.700
Sasuke.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:20.070
Don't worry.
I'll protect you with my life.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.840
I will not allow
my comrades to get killed.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.820
I wonder about that...

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.330
It's over.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.590
Sensei! 					Behind you!

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:20.960
Die!

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.910
The Water Clone Jutsu?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.650
It can't be!

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.500
In this mist…

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.440
did he actually copy me?

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:05.480
Don't move.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:21.390
It's over.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.700
O-Oh no!

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.400
Even Kakashi Sensei fell under
Zabuza's Jutsu.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.600
I've got to escape.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.840
I'll get killed, for real.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.170
This pain.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.410
What am I doing?!

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.750
I'd decided, hadn't I?
Not to run away no matter what happens.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.120
Next episode:
 "The Oath of Pain!"

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.420
I'm going to kick butt once again!
