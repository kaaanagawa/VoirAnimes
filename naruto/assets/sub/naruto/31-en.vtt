WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.030
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.200
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.240
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.650
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.660
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.660
Now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.450
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.790
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.660
Ugh... what are you here for now?

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.190
It’s our reunion after so long,
and you’re awfully cold.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.700
Don’t tell me that you came to
assassinate Lord Hokage?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670
No, no…

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.640
I don’t have enough
subordinates for that yet...

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.640
I’ve heard of the excellence ones
of this village

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.310
and thought I’d put dibs on them.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.450
A little while ago, I gave that
same Curse Mark as a present.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.650
There’s a kid that I want.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.820
Selfish as always.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.930
That kid will die.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.660
Certainly…

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.660
The odds are 1 in 10
that he’ll survive,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.730
but he may survive just like you did.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.440
This kid, you really like him, huh?

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.270
Are you jealous?

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.810
Are you still holding a grudge that
I used you and threw you away?

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.650
Unlike you, that kid will excel...

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.860
For one thing, he inherited
the Uchiha ability.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.660
He has beautiful features

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.530
and is a vessel who
can become my heir.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.770
If that kid lived,
it makes things interesting.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.070
Be sure not to cancel this test.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.310
Three from my village are also
under your care…

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.650
Make me enjoy it.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.520
If something happens
to deprive me of my fun,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.190
consider it the end of Leaf Village.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.580
We’ve secured food and water
after spending half a day.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.020
And now most teams have halted activity.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.090
As we planned,
this is the time that we attack.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.160
We'll split up into three
and go scouting.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.660
However, whether we find
other teams or not,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.400
we return to this place.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.660
Got it?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.970
Okay.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.900
Roger.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.640
Okay. Scatter!

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.750
Bushy-Brow’s Pledge:
Undying Love and Protection!

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.640
I can’t fall asleep...

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.610
I need to protect these two.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
I slept great!

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.060
Naruto!

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.660
Sasuke!

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.100
Did you take care of us?

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.060
Thank you, Sakura!

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.370
We’re totally better because of you!

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.640
That’s good...

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.650
A prey must always stay tense
and flee desperately

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.650
in front of the predator!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.600
My voice is gone!

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.740
It was just a dream...

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.020
Is it daybreak already?!

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.490
No, no way!

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.570
A squirrel?

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.810
Don’t surprise me like that!

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.110
Oh!

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.410
That was too close.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.650
Do you think she noticed?

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.980
The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.290
No, that’s not it.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.020
Huh? Then what? What was it?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.790
We’ll probably find out if we go closer.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.460
So... we should get going now.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.590
If I can catch all twenty of these leaves
before they hit the ground

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.660
Sakura will start to like me.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.430
If... if I can’t catch
even one of the leaves...!

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.470
It’ll be an unanswered love forever.
Or rather…

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.730
You’re too Bushy!

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.630
That’s what she’ll say.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.640
One, two, three, four...
five, six, seven, eight...

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.040
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
 fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.810
nine--! 					Ugh, nineteen...

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.080
One more!

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.420
That’s…!

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.290
Phew... just in time.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.500
This is called a Paper Bomb
and it explodes after some time.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.640
Who did such an awful thing?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.310
Stop hiding and come out.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.080
Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.420
Man, he’s a damn pain
and we've been discovered!

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.490
Strategy One, “hide and let it pass,”
was a failure!

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.530
So now we carry out Strategy Two!

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.460
Huh? Are you serious?

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.000
What? You have a problem with that?

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.400
There’s no question of success.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.310
Well, I guess it’s all right but...

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:28.650
Wow! To meet last year’s Number One
rookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:31.150
C-Can I have your autograph?

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.020
So it’s just you guys?

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.760
Take that! Strategy Two, “head over heals
infatuation with my sex appeal”!

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:44.300
I’d been wanting to meet you
for some time, you know?

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.030
Get lost!

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.600
Why? Why doesn’t my sexiness work?!

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.310
Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.110
Did you just raise your fists to me,
and does that mean you want to fight?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:06.780
N-No... 					Of course not.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.650
Then get lost.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.660
Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimps
 like you

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.990
would only make me
the laughing stock of the village.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.830
Y-Yes!

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.660
Huh... Really just like cockroaches.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.410
Just as I thought.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.940
A fellow like that wouldn’t take
a scroll away from wimps like us

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.250
unless we were to turn on him.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.580
All right! Let’s go find some wimps!

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.150
Like I’ve been saying
there’s no one wimpier than us...

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.230
So a no-sleep lookout?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.940
But it’s not necessary anymore.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:06.910
Wake Sasuke up.
We want to battle with him.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.080
Y-You bastards…

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.650
What’re you saying?

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.520
What is it you’re after?

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.660
I know the one called Orochimaru
is calling the shots from the shadows!

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.790
Huh?!

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.960
What’s that strange bruise on
the back of Sasuke’s neck?

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:25.730
You did this to Sasuke.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.460
How can you say you want to fight him?!

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.900
I wonder…what he has on his mind?

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.240
However, I can’t stay quiet
after hearing that.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.980
I will kill this girl,
I’ll also kill this Sasuke character.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.190
Wait, Zaku.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:50.750
Huh? What is it?

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.960
It’s so cliché.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.600
It’s the color of dirt
 that’s just been dug up.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.900
This grass, it doesn’t grow in
a place like this, does it?

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.000
Darn!

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.640
You know, with a trap...

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.040
there’s no point unless you
make it so it’s not discovered.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.580
Huh, how ridiculous!

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.250
So that Kunai knife was so the squirrel
wouldn’t be caught in the trap ?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.120
We kill her now!

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.160
A log?!

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.660
A trap above too? Watch out!

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.100
Just kidding.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.260
What?!

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.030
Clearly you have no talent.

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:41.570
Someone like you needs to
make more of an effort or else!

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.040
Leaf Hurricanes!

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.420
What?! This guy...

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.620
Then you also should... make an effort!

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:58.660
Who are you?

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.690
I’m the beautiful blue beast
of Leaf Village, Rock Lee!

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:19.380
Why are you here?

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.640
I will always appear...

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.650
whenever you’re in trouble!

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.490
Or should I say...

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.020
It was really because of you,
now run along.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.370
But right now, I’m also
your enemy!

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:44.640
I did say this once before, didn’t I?

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.910
That I’ll protect you until I die.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:53.980
Please go out with me!

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.650
I’ll protect you until I die!

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.520
Oh...

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.150
T-Thanks.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.590
Yes!

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.220
Perfect! I did it!
Gu Sensei, that was perfect!

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.330
I guess it can’t be helped...

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.030
Zaku. I’ll give you Sasuke.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.540
I will kill them!

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.210
As far as I can tell,
 Sakura is in no condition to fight.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.650
That Bushy-Brow guy is
 pretty proficient with Taijutsu...

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.750
Looks like I can have some fun!

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.660
There is a trick to your attack, isn’t there?

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.800
I won’t just simply avoid it.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.670
You showed me your Jutsu before.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.540
This guy…he’s strong.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.940
Having said that,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.780
the odds aren’t good since
it’s one versus three.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.780
I’m gonna have to take a chance.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.650
One person at a time...

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.520
I’ll give it my all and take each down!

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.660
There’s no one at all that seems wimpy!

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:26.640
Well, the only team that’s weaker
than us is the Naruto team.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.810
Idiot! You know what you’re saying?

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.640
What?!

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.110
No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.950
But that team has
the super genius Sasuke!

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.310
Hah! I wonder...

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.320
In actual battle that genius
might easily be beaten.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:42.650
What?!

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.660
All right, all right,
I apologize for irritating you.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.960
What a pain...

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.030
I say one negative thing about
Sasuke and I get the evil eye, every time…

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.640
There’s no way Sasuke
could be taken down!

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.670
Sakura’s a different matter though!

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.480
Huh?!

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.480
Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.250
Huh?!

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.580
...and Sakura is fighting.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.750
What did you say?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.990
Hey!

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.460
He’s late.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:27.700
That Lee...

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.770
Something’s not right.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.700
He’s always precise about time.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.710
Perhaps he ran into the enemy...

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.610
Could it be...?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.810
Huh, that wouldn’t have happened.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.220
In any case, let’s find Lee!

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.450
Right!

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.830
Yes! I’ve finally mastered it!
Yes! Yes!

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.230
My friends, there’s no reason
to give up on your youth!

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.370
This Jutsu...

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.480
In the end, only Lee
 could make it his own.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.750
Yahoo!

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.310
– Hey Lee...
– I did it! I will do it!

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.980
– Lee! 					– When I try! I try!

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:19.980
Hey, Lee!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.690
Hey!

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.660
Listen to this passionate message
from your teacher!

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.000
Oh... what is it?!

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.470
Please tell me using hip words.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.340
This Jutsu, the “Lotus”...

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.910
it will be dealt with henceforth
as a forbidden Jutsu.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.640
– What?! 					– Huh?!

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.410
W-What do you mean?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:52.650
This Jutsu poses a great burden
on the cells of the muscles,

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.020
it’s a kind of “Self-sacrificing Technique.”

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:00.120
Humans normally utilize,
at most, 20 percent...

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.930
of the “power” that the muscles have.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.000
Do you understand?
Only 20 percent!

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.070
And if nearly 100 percent
of the “power” is used

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.570
the muscles themselves will disintegrate.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:15.010
So, the brain usually controls the “power.”

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.240
However, this Jutsu forces the
brain’s limiter to go off by using Chakra,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.650
allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.190
In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsu
which relies on a secret technique

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.860
that brings forth “power” almost
 to the limit of one’s body.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.930
So the only time it is all right
to use this Jutsu

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.060
is when a certain condition is met...

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.670
So... when is that?

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.900
Take this to heart...

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.360
The condition is

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.520
Guy Sensei...

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.330
I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.290
Because this is the time you said...

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.630
"When protecting a previous person!"

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.550
He disappeared?!

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.990
Oh, oh no!

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:34.790
There's no way he can break his fall!

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.690
Take this!

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.530
Primary Lotus!

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.000
This feeling...

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.670
Well well...

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.550
Just in time.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.530
T-That's impossible!

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.890
That is a frightening Jutsu...

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.600
It did this much even though
I fell on the spongy dirt.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:21.400
It's now my turn.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.540
Oh no!

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.870
With what I just did...

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:31.250
Lee!

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.420
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.150
But our Jutsu exceeds that

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.260
and is the speed of sound!

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.330
I'll show you there are walls

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.650
which effort alone can never break through.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.190
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:31.430
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:40.940
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:49.320
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.230
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.030
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.670
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:12.640
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.080
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.650
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.460
Just sing.

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.700
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.030
The two are one

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:40.500
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.980
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.140
I'm so frustrated!

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.870
I'm just pulling feet again.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.850
I'm always just being protected.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.890
I always just watch them from behind.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.110
This time, I need to protect everyone!

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.640
Naruto, Sasuke, Lee!

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.320
I want to be like you too!

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.430
Next episode:
"Sakura Blossoms!"

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.630
Please watch my battle...
