WEBVTT

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.720
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.970
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.260
One more time

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
Are you really happy

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.510
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.220
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.890
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.760
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.970
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.350
Release the Genjutsu and
wake up Naruto and Shikamaru.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.600
He’ll be getting a mission
after such a long while.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.850
What do you mean by a mission?

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.840
Be careful…

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.970
It’s the first A-Ranked mission
since the Land of the Waves.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.680
Ouch!

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.760
You were able to release
the Genjutsu too!

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.930
Why were you pretending
to be asleep?!

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.800
Track down Sasuke,
join up and then stop him!

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.890
Then await next orders
in a safe place.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.840
Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.840
I’ll tell you the reason en route!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Let’s go!

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840
H-Hey!

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.720
I get it! So that’s what happened!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.680
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.840
So, why am I pulled into this?
This is such a drag!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.430
It can’t be helped!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
It’s Kakashi Sensei’s order.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.840
This way!

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.840
How long will it be until
we catch up?

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.430
I don’t know.
He is moving at a pretty good speed.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.300
Dang it!

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.840
A Shirker’s Call to Action:
Layabout No More!

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.930
Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.390
Huh? What is it?

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.430
Did you find Sasuke?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.640
No!

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.430
There are eight people in
two squads behind us…

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.390
No…

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.140
There’s one more…
There are nine people following us.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.840
What?!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.930
C’mon. Already?!
Give me a break!

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.140
It looks they haven’t grasped
our location, yet.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.840
We must lose them.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.840
Hey, what’s the point of stopping?!

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.100
Shut up and follow me!

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.140
Huh?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.550
We’re going back over our footprints.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.720
If we do that,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760
it’ll look to them like our footprints
suddenly disappeared.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.800
But, they’ll notice even
if we do this, right?

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.840
It’ll buy us some time.
That’s enough.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.390
It’ll be a matter for great celebration
if our pursuers get impatient,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.140
cloud their eyes of pursuit
and lose sight of the trail.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.470
Hurry!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.430
There’s no time.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.720
I-I know!

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.050
This is not good.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.220
Though they're on
alert for ambushes,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.890
they’re catching up with us
slowly, but surely.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.600
Dang it!

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.350
Probably they’re all Chunin or higher.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.930
We’ll be wiped out if they catch up.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.840
Wiped out…

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.430
Dang it! Since it’s come to this,
why don’t we ambush them?!

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840
Ambush?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.390
Right.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.840
Indeed, an ambush would
be to our advantage.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.100
Even if the opponent has twice
the people than we do,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.180
if we just catch them off-guard…

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840
That’s no good.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.140
Our opponents are former
Leaf Shinobi Orochimaru’s henchmen.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.800
In the worst case scenario,
there might be Jonin.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.600
I thought it’d work,
but I guess not, huh.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.840
Hold it. Why?

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.550
The level of opponent doesn’t have
much to do with an ambush.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.840
What do you mean?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.930
You guys don’t get it.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.390
Listen. Indeed, an ambush is
a very advantageous fundamental tactic.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.840
But two conditions are necessary.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.840
What are those necessary conditions?

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.050
Number one.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.930
The ones on the run must act without
making noise and find the enemy first.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.840
Number two.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.840
One must be able to catch
the pursuers off guard,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.840
capture a point and position
to be able to inflict certain damage,

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.840
and conceal oneself quickly.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.840
Ah… Huh?

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.840
An ambush only becomes effective
when these two conditions are ensured.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.850
Well, the first condition
won’t be so difficult

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.800
since we have the Ninja Hound’s nose.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.800
And the second one also
seems advantageous at a glance

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.350
since we know the geography
of our village.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.840
But Orochimaru has spent time
in the Leaf before.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.890
That approach won’t work
on his henchmen.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.100
So what do you really mean?

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.220
Our pursuers must have been instructed
in the terrain of this village

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.220
and have gone through
simulated practice for this fight.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.600
And on top of that,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.550
they’re probably all Ninja
who have mastered the pursuit arts.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.390
So they know what cards we have, huh.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.890
Well, even so, the fact remains
that an ambush is advantageous.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.100
But there are too many elements
of uncertainty.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.680
In the first place, the enemy is
a special unit organized for this operation.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.850
But we have a fool…

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.600
a Kunoichi who’s nothing special…

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.800
and one dog…

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.840
and, me with the number-one cold feet!

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.720
A tactic is grasping the conditions
that are there without fail

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.600
and formulating an optimal plan.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.550
And so, there’s only one thing
that we can do now…

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.100
One?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.640
A diversion in the guise
of an ambush.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.300
One person will remain,
pretend to ambush,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.010
and delay the pursuers.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.850
In other words…

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.800
bait.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.760
Right. If we delay them,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.050
they won’t be able to grasp
the positions of the remaining three.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.600
If we do that, we’ll be able
to shake off our pursuers,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.300
but the one who has become
the bait will probably…

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.140
die.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.760
So, who’s going to do it?

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.430
We need the dog to follow Sasuke.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.800
That means…

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.010
Fine…

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.840
– I'll…
– I guess it has to be me.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:20.970
Shikamaru?!

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.220
W-Why you?!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.840
It’s better than being wiped out, right?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.840
Besides, among us,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.220
the only one who is equal
to playing the bait

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.050
and who has the possibility
of surviving…

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.510
is me.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.350
Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Art
originally intended as a delay tactic, so…

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.680
Well, I’ll catch up later!

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.680
Now get going!

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.300
We’re counting on you, Shikamaru!

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.260
Sakura!

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.550
Yeah.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.800
Was Shikamaru ever this reliable
of a character?

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.300
Be careful…

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.600
Shikamaru.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.640
No matter how much you try to erase
the signs of your presence…

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.800
you’re in plain view.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.390
Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.840
What did you say?!

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.010
I wonder if he’s really
delaying the enemy.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.600
Me with the number-one cold feet!

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.350
Don’t tell me, Shikamaru…

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.100
Shikamaru will be okay!

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.840
Don’t tell me, he ran away.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.760
I said he’ll be okay!

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840
What’ll be okay?!

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.100
He has a dirty mouth and
always says stuff is a pain.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.350
But he wouldn’t betray us!

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.010
He hardly ever says
he’ll do something himself,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.140
but he makes sure to do it
if he says it!

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.350
That’s absolute.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.840
I want to believe…
I want to believe, but…

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.760
Pick up the pace!

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.100
I somehow managed to
get away completely.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.800
Their strides are irregular.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:17.050
Urgency is probably increasing
their fatigue.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.550
Sorry about that.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.430
I was supposed to be the guy
with the number one cold feet.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.840
It seems my character has
changed just a bit this time.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.680
The fact that I’m tired is true.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.800
Those footprints are wrong.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.720
By the way, this is what
the dog’s paw print really is.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.350
Oh, he’s still a kid.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.220
To think we’d all get caught like this.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.260
So this is the rumored Leaf Village’s
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.140
That’s an old way of saying it!

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:18.850
The times are passing!

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.840
It’s called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,
old man.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.550
Sure enough,
that match wasn’t good.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.470
I used too much Chakra.
I can’t hang on much longer…

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.720
1, 2, 3, 4…

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.050
5, 6, 7…8.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.600
Eight people…

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.430
Eight… No, there’s one more…

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.680
There are nine people following us.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.600
Sure enough, the ninth person’s role is
to protect against them getting ambushed.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.220
That person stays at a fixed distance,

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.510
moves in the back and responds
to an enemy attack.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.680
But…this will make clear where
that person’s hiding!

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.180
There, huh?!

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.800
Dang it… The Shadow won’t reach.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.840
I don’t have the stamina to
send it to Chakra.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.390
It’s futile. I see through your technique.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.840
Is this as far as it goes?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.840
It looks like you’re at your limit…

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.850
This Shadow Possession Jutsu
is going to break very soon.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.640
Prepare yourself!

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.550
I wanted to…
become a Ninja any which way,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.550
save up money any which way,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.140
get married any which way to
an ordinary woman

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.840
who’s neither beautiful nor ugly

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.100
and have two kids any which way.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.760
First will be a girl, and then a boy…

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.510
I would retire from being a Ninja
when my eldest daughter marries

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.100
and my son becomes a full-fledged man.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.050
And then I take it easy
in my life of retirement

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.680
playing Japanese chess
and Go the whole day.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.840
Then I die of old age before my wife.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.010
Such a life would’ve been nice.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.850
I was out of character,
I tried too hard this time.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.640
I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.680
What I did was a drag…

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.850
Hmm, the movements of
our pursuers have stopped.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.180
Yes! The delaying was a success!

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:18.930
Shikamaru, eh?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:23.050
I’m sorry I doubted you, even a little.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:24.840
Okay!

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.970
Now…you wait, Sasuke.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.840
And…Shikamaru…

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.180
Live, and catch up to us no matter what!

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.760
As you say, it seems I’m at my limit.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.720
Hey, come on out.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.260
While you’re at it, cut off his head.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.350
I finally caught up.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.840
A-Asuma?! Why?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.510
Well done, Shikamaru.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.140
Sure enough, out of character.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.840
For the time being, you retire here.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.470
Hurry!

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.850
What a pest.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.640
The pursuers have increased?
Two? No, three?

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.180
Kankuro! Pick up the pace!

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.010
Okay.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.430
I won’t let you get away.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.180
Don’t jump the gun, Sasuke.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.840
Sasuke.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.850
Now then, shall we begin?

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:28.050
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:39.390
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:55.050
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.100
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:05.510
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:10.760
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:31.720
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:42.260
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.050
I don’t know what’s going on!

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.840
Why is Old Man Hokage
fighting with Orochimaru?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.300
Why is Sasuke going after
that guy with shadows around his eyes?

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.840
I don’t understand why we have
to go after him,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.760
but that’s what we have to do right now!

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.840
Wait up, Sasuke!

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.390
Next time: “An Unrivaled Match:
Hokage Battle Royale!”

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.430
What the heck’s happening
to the village?!
