WEBVTT

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.660
C'mon!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.630
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.900
Being chased by something

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.310
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.980
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.710
For no single one,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.520
To none does belong,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.490
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.730
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.530
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.030
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.400
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.370
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.810
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.380
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.890
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.520
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.590
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.600
Rockin' my heart

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770
I think we almost finished
shaking off the losers.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.500
Then I guess I'll move
onto the main issue.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.900
It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.170
All right!

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.180
Here is the tenth question!

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.010
Here it comes!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.350
I have to put everything on
the line for this question!

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.420
The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.530
Hmph! Making such a big deal.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.930
This is the final obstacle.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.940
Kankuro, come back already!

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.940
If he starts the tenth question,
your cheat sheet has no meaning!

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.740
But before that,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.520
I'm going to add
some rules for the last question.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.530
Aren't you lucky?

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.070
It looks like playing with
the dolls wasn't a waste, after all?

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.600
This guy.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.970
He's figured Crow out!

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.410
Anyway, sit down.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.030
Let me explain!

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.530
These are

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.970
the hopeless rules!

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.970
Well, anyhow.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.510
There's nothing to do when
the subordinates are gone, huh?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.510
Well, it'll get busy soon enough.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.110
Why?

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.480
This year's first proctor...

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.950
I hear it's that Ibiki Morino.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.190
Well then, passing the first exam
already seems iffy.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.900
Of all the people, that sadist...

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.530
Sadist?

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.970
Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,
 so you wouldn't know.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.410
Who is this person?

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.080
He is a pro, a professional.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.150
Professional? Of what?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.320
Torture and interrogation.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.490
What?!

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.630
Well, there maybe no physical torture
in the exam itself,

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.570
but he's sure to use his
his skills as an interrogator

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.640
to torment them psychologically.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.670
That is...

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.510
Leaf Village Anbu's
Torture and Interrogation Unit Marshall,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.510
Ibiki Morino!

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.520
Hopeless rules...?!

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.490
First, you guys will have to choose

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.530
whether or not you will take
this 10th question!

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.900
Huh?!

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.500
Choose whether or not
to take the exam?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.670
What, choose?!

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.510
What happens if you choose not
to take the 10th exam?

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.710
If you chose not to take the exam,
then your score will be zero.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.650
In other words, you fail!

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.520
And of course, the same goes for
the two others in the same group!

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.160
W-What does that mean!

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.690
Of course, everybody is going to
choose to take the exam!

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.430
This is ridiculous!
As if we have a choice!

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.700
And... one more rule...

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.070
Another one?!

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.900
Finish with it already!

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.510
If you chose to take it and
are unable to answer it correctly,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.180
then you will have to...

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.780
relinquish your right
of taking the Chunin Exam forever.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.190
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.020
Besides, there are plenty
of people here

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.930
who have taken the
Chunin Exam many times!

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.900
You're just unlucky.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.310
I make the rule this year.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.850
But I did give you
the option to go back!

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.620
For those of you who aren't confident,
you can choose not to take it

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.520
and take the exam
next year or the year after that.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.690
Oh! How terrible!

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.660
If one out of the three
chooses not to take the exam,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.130
then all three will be failed.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.570
If you do choose to take it,
but get the wrong answer...

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.410
then that person will be a
Genin for the rest of their life!

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.080
No matter what,
the odds are against us!

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.850
It's an impossible choice
for anyone with normal nerves!

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.990
Then, let's begin...

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.160
The 10th question…

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.030
Those who will not be taking it,
raise your hands!

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.530
Once I confirm your number,
I'll ask you to leave!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.510
What kind of a question
is it going to be….?

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.510
Darn!

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.080
If I get it wrong,
I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.210
I don't want that!

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.510
But if I choose not take it...!

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.620
then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!
I don't want that either!

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.320
I won't raise my hand!

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.290
I'm confident that
I can answer it correctly.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.190
But…

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.930
But Naruto! You're different!

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.470
You should retreat this time
even if it means to ignore us

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500
and think of your next chance
to take the Exam!

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.580
I... I...

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.850
I'm quitting!
I'm not going to take it!

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.820
#50 failed!

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.990
# 130, #111 will be
failed as well...

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.530
I-I'm sorry...
Gennai! Inaho!

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.630
Darn...

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:42.530
M-Me too!

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.300
Me too!

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.520
Naruto...

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.220
Why don't you raise your hand?

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.760
That guy...

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.160
I am the super elite ninja

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.930
who will be carrying
the name of the Hokage!

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.200
My name is Naruto Uzumaki,
remember that!

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.500
Shut up!

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.740
I'm prepared to do anything
to become a Hokage!

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.540
I will surpass the Hokage!

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.580
And I will make all of
the people in the village

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.220
acknowledge my presence!

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.390
He's always got such a one-track mind.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.890
Saying Hokage, Hokage
all the time like a fool.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.760
I'm sorry, Naruto.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.200
It seems like...

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.430
I don't want to...

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.440
crush your unachievable dreams.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.410
That guy...

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.520
Ibiki completely understands how
the human psyche works.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.520
And the most horrifying part is...

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:51.860
that by cornering people psychologically
he controls their psyche and

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.930
reveals the fundamental
weakness of a human.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.350
Don't underestimate me!
I won't run!

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.080
I'll take it!

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.650
But even if I'm stuck being
a Genin forever,

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.520
I will  become a Hokage
no matter what it takes!

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.730
I'm not scared!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.370
That guy, he wasn't even
thinking of us at all.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.610
Such audacity!

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.440
That's right…

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.680
That's exactly the kind of fool you are!

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.620
I'll ask again.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.420
It's a choice that will alter your life.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.890
If you want to quit, now is your chance!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.430
I'm not going to take back
my words!

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.530
That is my Way of Ninja!

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.340
Huh... What a funny kid.

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.510
He completely brushed away
those kids' anxieties.

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.050
78, huh? Much more left
than I expected.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.920
It's going to be the same.
No matter how much more I push it.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.600
I like your determination!

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.530
Then...

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.500
For those who are still here...

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.240
The first exam...

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.340
You have passed it!

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.550
Huh?

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.490
H-Hey, what does that mean?

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.520
All of a sudden you're telling us
that we've passed!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.930
What about the 10th question?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.330
There wasn't such
a thing to begin with!

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.030
Well, you can look at the choice you
just had to make as the 10th question!

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.240
What?!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:13.440
Hey!

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.110
Then, what were all
those nine questions for!

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.510
It was just a waste of time!

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.040
Not a waste...

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.120
The objective of the nine questions
were already accomplished.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.890
To test your individual ability
to gather information!

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.160
Ability to gather information?

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.530
First…

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.260
The focus of this test was

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.530
on the system of determining
the pass or failure

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.040
based on the three-person groups
that was proposed in the first rule.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.310
By grading the exam on
a group basis,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:54.180
I added the unimaginable pressure
of dragging down your teammates.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.810
I see, I see.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.280
I kind of felt that was
the point of this test!

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.450
No , you didn't!

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.860
However...

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.490
The questions on these tests weren't
things that

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.330
you Genin Ninja would
have been able to solve...

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.530
So in that case…

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.540
I imagined that most of you here
would have come to this conclusion:

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.910
"In order to score points,
I'll have to cheat."

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:23.770
In other words,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.110
this exam was created under the premise
that you all would cheat!

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.820
That being said,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.960
I had two Chunin in the group
who knew all of the answers

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.130
from whom you could cheat.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.870
What?! That's what it was?

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.500
I had a hard time figuring
out the guy.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.270
Yeah. Really...

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.440
It was so obvious!

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.510
There's something wrong with you
if you didn't notice!

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.150
Right, Hinata?!

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.520
He... didn't realize it...

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.320
However...

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.520
those who just foolishly cheated,
naturally were disqualified.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.060
That's because...

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.030
Information, depending on
the time and situation,

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.530
it will be more valuable than life.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.570
And in a mission or on a battlefield,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.270
you will always have to risk your life
to fight for it!

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.450
Horrible burn marks, nail punctures
and scratches...

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.520
Those are signs of physical torture!

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.390
When information is gathered

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.520
and the enemy or a third party
finds out about it,

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.030
that information is no longer
guaranteed to be correct.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.400
Just remember this.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.600
To be given the wrong information

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.540
can bring a catastrophic blow
to your friends and town.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.210
So that is why, out of necessity,
we forced you guys to cheat

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.580
in order to test your ability
to collect information.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:16.520
And we filtered out those who
were clearly lacking in those abilities.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.290
But...

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.590
The last question doesn't
make any sense.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.390
However...

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.770
this 10th question was
the main issue of this first exam.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:29.900
Huh?

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.240
What do you mean?

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.970
I'll explain.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.110
The tenth question was to
take on the question, or not.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.810
Needless to say, it is
a painful decision to make.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.850
Those who chose not to
take on the question,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.320
would be immediately failed
along with their whole squad!

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.720
Those who chose to answer
the question and got it wrong…

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.530
would be robbed of their chance
to take the Exam forever.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.200
It really is an unfair question.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.240
Then, how about these two choices?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.640
Let's say that you guys did
become a Chunin.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.440
The mission is to steal
a secret document!

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.510
You have no idea how many
Ninjas the enemy has,

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.980
their ability, and other armament
they may have.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.160
On top of that, there maybe
the pitfall of an enemy trap.

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.490
Now this mission...
Will you take it? Or not take it?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.460
Because you want your life spared...

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.960
Because your partners will
be put in danger...

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.070
Can you get away from
dangerous missions?

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.140
The answer is...

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.040
No!

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.780
There are going to be missions
you cannot avoid

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.810
no matter how risky or
dangerous it may be!

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.280
Showing your courage to
your teammates in a tight spot,

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.150
and the ability to get through
the hardships...

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.060
This is the quality that is needed
in a Chunin troop leader!

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.070
In a pinch, there are
those who cannot risk their own fate,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.410
and those who waver and give up
their chances

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.510
because they think they
will have another chance.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.520
I believe that such fools who don't have
strong determination

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.120
have no right to become a Chunin!

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.520
For those of you who chose
to take on the question,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.690
you can say that you have successfully
answered the difficult 10th question!

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.530
You shall be able to take on
the adversity that may lie in your way.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.070
You've passed through the gates!

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.770
The fist exam for the Chunin Exam
has been completed.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.810
I wish you well!

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.610
All right! Wish us well!

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.380
I did it! I did it! 					Yeaah!

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.520
What a funny guy...

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.070
W-What's going on?!

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.300
Gosh, this one...

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.170
You guys!

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.110
This isn't the time to be
celebrating!

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.880
I'm the proctor for the second exam!
Anko Mitarashi!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.220
Let's move onto
the next stage! Next!

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.520
Follow me!

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.530
Read the atmosphere.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.130
This proctor...
ls kind of like Naruto.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.870
78?! Ibiki!
You let 26 teams slide by?

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.980
I guess, the first exam this time around
was too easy.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.850
It seems like this time,
there are a lot of excellent candidates.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.980
Huh! Well, all right...

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.720
I'll drop more than half of them
in the second exam!

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.660
M-More than half?

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.960
I'm getting excited.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.530
I'll give you the details tomorrow.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.230
We'll be changing locations,

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.440
so get information from your Jonin
about the location and the time!

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.110
That's it. You're dismissed.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.530
I didn't think that there would be a guy
that would pass with a blank sheet.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.500
Naruto Uzumaki...
He really is a funny guy.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.680
W-What is this place?!

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.680
NO TRESPASSING

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.690
This is the location for
the "second exam",

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.560
the 44th Training Field.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.890
Also known as... the Forest of Death.

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.530
The Forest of... Death?!

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.230
I passed the first exam!

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.230
I'm just going to hop, jump
and take a big step and...

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.400
Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.770
Hey, you guys!

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.510
if you want to play a Ninja game...

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.010
No? What?
You came here for a mission?!

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:27.520
Next episode:
"Special Report:
		Live from the Forest of Death!"

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.520
As for me, I'm going to kick-butt again!
