WEBVTT

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.700
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.450
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.250
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.490
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.580
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.040
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.490
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.000
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.450
All the kids said

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.450
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.660
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.330
All the kids said

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.160
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.790
All the kids said

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.250
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.080
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.410
All the kids took off

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.830
into this windless night

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.370
Because they want to change something

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.620
For a Friend!

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.580
What did you say?!

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.750
You mean to say that only rookies
went after Sasuke?!

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.490
It really couldn’t be helped…

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.370
the situation in
the Village being how it is…

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.330
And anyway…

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.200
I’ve taken the minimally
required measures.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.490
Hey, hey!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.490
Your mission has already
been assigned!

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.490
Uh, I’m gonna go do an errand
and will be back shortly…

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.870
Don't worry.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.250
Geez…

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.290
Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.290
Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.410
It’s already been two days
since Sasuke left the village…

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.540
And Naruto and the others who went in
pursuit haven’t come back either.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.830
And neither has Lee…

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.490
I know. I’ve more or less
heard the whole story.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.330
I…believe in Naruto!

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.000
I believe him, but if something were
to happen to Naruto and Sasuke…

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.580
Sakura, you don’t need to
worry about anything.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.160
Leave this to me.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.490
Summoning Jutsu!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.540
First of all, I want you guys to
fan out in all directions

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.080
in pursuit of Naruto
and Sasuke’s scent.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.910
Naruto and Sasuke you said?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.620
Did something happen
to the two of them?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.700
I’ll explain later…
Right now, time is of essence.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.580
Okay.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.490
As soon as you confirm that
you’ve detected the scent,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.490
call me and I’ll be there immediately.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.950
All right! Scatter!

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.490
Well, I guess since she saw them
fight before her very eyes…

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.120
it’s useless to tell her
not to worry.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.200
Stop!

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.290
Damn…

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.200
I can’t stop…

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.580
Sasuke… Stop with revenge.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.660
What?!

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.290
Even if you were successful
in carrying out your revenge,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.040
all that will come out of it
is a sense of emptiness.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.450
Shut up!

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.200
What do you know?!

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.490
Don’t say that so knowingly!

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.700
Well…calm down.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.490
Neither you nor I could
call ourselves lucky.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.540
Of that much I'm certain.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.290
But it could be worse.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.120
Both you and I have found
precious comrades, right?

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.410
We understand that all the more
because we’ve lost them once.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.040
I taught you Chidori

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.490
because you now have
precious people.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.370
That power isn’t something to be used
against your comrades or for revenge.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.490
You know what that power
should be used for.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.830
I’m gonna win no matter what!

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.790
Don’t get so carried away!

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.290
I was too naïve…

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.290
Watching them, they might actually
be intent on killing each other…

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.000
Kakashi Sensei…

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.500
Please let me get there
in time!

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.790
I already said this earlier but…

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.080
In truth, you were waiting
for this too, weren’t you?

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.910
Neither Kakashi nor Sakura
are present right now.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.490
So there’s nobody here to stop us
like that time before.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.450
You…!

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.250
This time around we’re gonna
settle this for real!

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.790
I will take you down!

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.700
Chidori!

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.910
You idiot…

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.490
Same here!
I’m gonna clobber you…

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.290
and take you back home even
if I have to drag you!

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.830
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.700
Rasengan!

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.950
It wasn’t meaningless…

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.490
To me, you became
my closest friend.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.540
Sasuke actually came out
and said that…to me…

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.870
And that’s exactly the reason why
I wanted to verify it using this Rasengan.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.080
Damn…

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.490
Damn you!

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.330
Damn…

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.700
He was able to counter

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.790
my full power of Chidori
to that extent…

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.120
That jutsu…

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.490
Damn…

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.370
Naruto, to what extent…!

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.290
That loser…

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.040
Naruto…!

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.490
Well, your limit is two blows…
that’s about it.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.620
And if I try to use more than that…

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:40.490
what will happen?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.490
The third blow won’t initiate.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.490
Remember that well.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.410
If you try to initiate
the Jutsu forcibly…

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:52.790
not only will the Art not
initiate properly,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.870
but your Chakra will become zero…

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.370
In the worst case scenario
it will cost you your life!

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.660
Damn… I can’t waste a blow…

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.250
It wouldn’t serve any purpose
if we cancel each other like earlier.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.540
There’s…no longer
any mistake about this.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.490
You…really intended…

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.830
You really intended to…

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.490
Sasuke…!

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.290
I will use numerous speedy techniques
and Jutsu to create an opening.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.540
And then…I will make
a hit with Chidori.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.830
Sasuke…

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.870
Did you know, Naruto…

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.660
Top-class Ninja should be
able to read each other‘s hearts

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.490
simply by an exchange of fists.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.040
Even without saying anything…

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.490
You’re naïve, Naruto.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.370
How about it?

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.040
Were you really able
to read inside…

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.200
this heart of mine?

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.580
Fire Style:
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.490
Sasuke… I knew that you
were always alone.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.490
At first, I was relieved
when I found out

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.040
that there was
a guy similar to myself.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.200
And it also made me happy…

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.500
To tell the truth, I really wanted
to approach you right away.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.910
But…I wasn’t able to approach you…

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.290
– Awesome…
– You’re incredible…

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.490
You were always able
to do everything.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.160
And moreover, you were always
being praised by everyone.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.160
Because you and I
were so different…

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.830
Because I didn’t want to admit it,
I decided to call you my rival.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.250
I didn’t want to lose to you…

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.080
and I felt that even more strongly…

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.490
because I was called a loser.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.490
Even when we were
in the Squad Seven,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.830
I continued to feel
the same way the whole time.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.410
I’m stubborn…

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.490
And wasn’t able to express
what I really felt…

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.490
What I really wanted was
to become like you.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:05.870
You were what I aspired to…so…

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.040
You are one of the ones
I want to fight.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.250
I was really happy when
you said that!

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.790
Those were your first words…
acknowledging me…

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.660
You and I both knew,

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.700
without us even having to
have an exchange of fists!

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.490
From that time on…

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.160
Even without saying anything…

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.490
The fact that…

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.040
we are friends!

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.540
It’s not without meaning…

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.490
To me you’re…

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.490
my closest friend.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.540
However…you’re trying to
take me down for real.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.950
Right now, I don’t really know

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.700
whether you really meant
what you said earlier or not.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.580
Thinking that we were friends…

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.620
That might have been…

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.660
That might have been just me…

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.160
It’s too late now!

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.000
Naruto!

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.490
If that’s the case…I’m…

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.490
really lame, aren’t I…

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.290
Sasuke!

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.700
But…

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.490
It can’t be helped, can it?

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.040
I don’t know why but…

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.490
I don’t know why…

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.490
But I…

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.290
I…

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.200
don't want you…

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.790
you to be taken away
by someone like Orochimaru!

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.870
You managed to divert it
with your left hand,

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.490
but it was meaningless.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.290
You won't be able to use
any hand sign

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.490
or that Jutsu earlier anymore.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.750
This is the end!

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.490
Wh-What’s…

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.620
that red Chakra…?

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.490
Where does he get that
kind of power from?!

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.620
W-What the heck…is this?!

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:22.490
His shoulder injury is healing…

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.490
That’s unbelievable!

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:04.370
Sasuke! I’m not gonna let
Orochimaru take you away!

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.750
I will stop you,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:14.200
even if I have to break every bone
in your arms and legs!

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.410
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:35.620
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:46.330
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:56.040
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.790
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:12.160
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:23.790
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:34.330
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words
