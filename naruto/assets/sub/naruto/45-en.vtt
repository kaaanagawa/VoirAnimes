WEBVTT

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.450
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.360
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.460
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.230
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.400
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.440
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.650
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.280
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.690
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.760
It will come, closer

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.660
Now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.210
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.640
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.480
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.920
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.650
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.990
There will be no meaning

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.430
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.120
I'm going...

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.660
to become the Hokage.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.460
I can’t lose here!

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.900
You? Hokage?!

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.660
When you’re weaker than me?

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.640
I’ll become... Hokage for you!

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.910
Transform!

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.450
Hey hey, are you serious?

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.650
You’ve been here three years

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.650
and you can’t even do
a respectable transformation?!

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.550
All of you watch now!

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.190
I will absolutely someday become
the true and a real Hokage!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.670
Lame! What Hokage?!

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.040
You know deep down inside that
you can’t become the Hokage.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.070
So quit acting tough!

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.880
You’re wrong Kiba…

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.500
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage…

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.940
You... will be the loser!

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.650
Surprise Attack!
Naruto's Surprise Weapon!

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.560
Man! Same thing over and over again.
You're pesky!

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.200
Well, never mind.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.540
I’ll just make it so
you won’t stand up again!

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.740
Let’s go, Akamaru!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.070
You think you can get me with
that same technique again?!

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.640
Take this!

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.930
Darn!

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.670
Fang Over Fang!

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.450
This Jutsu…

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.280
Though, I’ve seen it before…

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.150
it’s not a Jutsu you can dodge
over and over!

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.690
What do I do?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.920
What should I do?!

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.940
Looks like you’ve got nothing left.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.370
I’ve got plenty left!

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.640
Even if you increased yourself by
three or four, I’d still have a lot left!

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.850
You’ve got a comeback
for everything!

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.450
Let’s finish him with the next!
Akamaru!

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.400
Darn!

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.900
I have to counterattack somehow.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.610
Even if I do, it has to get Kiba
or there’s no point!

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.650
But which is which…?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.290
W-What will you do? Naruto!

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.660
Naruto…

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.700
T-That’s it!

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.770
Transform!

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.910
You’re mine!

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.650
I see how it is…

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.920
Huh?

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.650
There, look closely.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.220
Oh!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.870
You did it!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.870
That’s a clever move, Naruto!

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.640
Naruto!

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.940
If he transforms into Kiba,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.950
the real Kiba doesn’t know which is
Akamaru and which is Naruto…

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.650
He can’t attack carelessly.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.850
However, it’s okay for Naruto
to attack either one!

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.490
Oooh!

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.690
He created a chance opening…

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.430
Good work!

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.860
I see, so that’s your move…

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.530
But…

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.030
I’ll give you a piece of advice!

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.870
I was careless before and
a little late to realize it…

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.710
But the Transformation Jutsu
isn’t effective anymore!

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.740
Why, you ask?

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.540
Yeah!

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.580
I can smell you.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.020
Don’t mess with our
sense of smell, Naruto.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.660
By concentrating his Chakra
into his nose,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.670
Kiba’s sense of smell is enhanced tens
of thousands times more than average.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.270
Of course, he can determine
people by their smell too.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.270
Heh, I won!

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.310
W-What?!

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.920
What's going on?!

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.650
Kiba’s nose got Naruto and
Akamaru mixed up?

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.690
Darn! What in the world is going on…?!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.870
Then you’re Naruto!

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.400
Messing with me!

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.410
What?!

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.780
Well, this is coming from
the original prankster, after all…

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.420
He’s had it!

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.970
He did it!

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.270
Naruto… Awesome!

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.520
Darn it!

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.690
So that’s it…

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.660
Naruto, transformed into Kiba,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.560
was discovered by the real Kiba
with smell and hit…

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.900
But Naruto didn’t come back
in true Naruto form.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.640
Instead, he transformed into
Akamaru instantly!

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.040
In order to make it look as if it
was Akamaru who was hit

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.550
and his impersonation
transformation dissolved!

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.650
Was Naruto ever that smart…?

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.350
You little…!

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.290
Think hard about your Jutsu
before you use them!

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.300
Because they’ll be used
against you, stupid!

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.700
He’s using my line, word to word…

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.410
Arguing with this guy is only
a waste of time!

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.510
Don’t go at Naruto’s pace…

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:57.880
Calm down.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.110
Calm down!

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.850
He can’t actually keep up with
my movements yet…

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.860
I still have the advantage!

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.660
Look closely at Naruto’s movements
and if there’s an opening…

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.900
I can surely take him from
behind with the All-Four Jutsu.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.740
Nothing to get flustered about…

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.640
If I do this in a level-headed manner,
it’s a match I will most certainly win!

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.880
Evidently your enemy
has become calm…

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.780
Well, what will you do, Naruto…?

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.950
So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.290
Well then... I’ll end this…

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.860
with my new special technique
I’ve been saving up!

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.640
So you’ve finally gotten serious, Kiba?

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.070
Well then... I’ll end this…

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.140
with my new special technique
I’ve been saving up!

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.410
What?!

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.720
New special trick?!

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.650
Huh? When did he…?!

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.660
Leave it to Naruto to hide
a new technique!

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.660
What new special technique!

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.360
That’s obviously a bluff!

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.960
You can test out whether
it’s a bluff or not!

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.530
This hasn’t changed since before…

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.400
Don’t let his pace get to you.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.670
Calm down!

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.510
Let’s go!

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:37.940
I don’t know what kind of
technique this is but…!

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.610
I just won’t let you do it!

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.650
Now!

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.520
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…
All-Four Jutsu!

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.460
Q-Quick…

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.670
Why are you stopping?!

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.410
Naruto!

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.640
Naruto!

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.790
Just as I thought, this is as
far as he will go.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.660
Stand up! Naruto!

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.100
D-Darn! I don’t even have time
to work up my Chakra!

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.070
Hey hey! What’s wrong?!

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.070
Naruto!

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.810
He’s fast!

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.710
It’s no good.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.650
He doesn’t have time to
form hand Signs!

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.320
There’s too much of a difference
in their strength…

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.650
It’s impossible for Naruto, after all.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.960
Naruto…

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.670
D-Darn!

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.340
Take this!

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.050
What?!

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.650
Take that!

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.670
I’m going to be Hokage!

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.240
I won’t lose here!

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.570
Whatever! You can’t keep up
with my speed at all!

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.360
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.670
Naruto!

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.640
This is what it’s like when
I really let it out.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.190
You understand, don’t you?

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.360
To me, you’re merely…!

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.690
I...

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.960
Huh?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.660
will absolutely not lose!

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.540
That Naruto… He’s a fighter.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.240
Yup.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.680
If I were Kiba,
I’d be sick of this already.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.910
It doesn’t matter which anymore,
I just wish they’d settle it quickly.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.720
Naruto...

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.650
Fight!

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.150
Naruto! Use the new technique
or whatever!

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.320
Just settle it!

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.660
Naruto! Go for it!

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.700
I have to find some opening
in that darn Kiba…

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.440
You’ve got absolutely no effect on me!

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.080
You’ve got spirit, I’ll give you that!

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.050
He’s close at his end…

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.850
I’ll settle it with the next one!

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.020
I’ll make the new technique
explode no matter what!

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:16.650
I won’t let you!

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.690
You’re slow!

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.790
Take this!

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.230
Oops!

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.910
Fast movements and a keen nose…

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.650
The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry
turned out to be harmful…

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.920
Right now Kiba’s sense of smell
is tens of thousands times

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.650
more powerful than normal…

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:53.660
Well…

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.660
That fart was probably
a freak accident, but…

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.330
That’s what you’d expect from
the number one unpredictable Ninja.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.730
Naruto!

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.170
Now’s your chance!

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:06.640
Darn!
I was straining too much…

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.740
But now’s the time to show
my new technique!

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.310
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:17.650
Naruto!

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.920
Okay! The way you’ve torn me
apart up until now,

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.450
I’ll give it back all at once!

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.330
D-Darn it!

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:38.900
U-!

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.640
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.120
Naruto... Barrage!

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.310
A new technique, eh?

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.650
Well, he was watching Sasuke’s
technique a moment ago…

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.820
Lion Barrage!

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.660
For the record, the name
is a rip off, too.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.020
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.750
Ohhhh!

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.650
Cha!

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.060
Nice one!

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:07.560
You did it!

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.090
That Naruto beat Kiba!

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.500
It’s a major upset…

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.260
Yup!

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:16.970
Yes!

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.420
I’m…getting stronger!

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.930
That was easy!

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.330
W-What to do?

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.370
What should I do…?

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.640
N-Naruto...

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.180
Huh? Hinata?

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.540
Did you say something?

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.280
Ah, ah, ah… 					Umm…

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:17.660
Huh?

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.460
Hinata…?

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.100
What's this?

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:25.640
It’s an ointment.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.770
Why for me?

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.810
Take it for her, Naruto.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.990
Hmmm. Okay!

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.360
Thank you! You’re nice, Hinata!

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.300
Kiba, it’s nothing to be
embarrassed about …

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.600
This kid was a really
strong opponent.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.920
You are taking this pretty easy,
aren’t you, Lady Hinata…?

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.000
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:35.570
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:45.150
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:53.460
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:00.030
Or else I’ll cry

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.230
You won't have to search around you

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:07.770
It’s all ok now.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:16.650
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:22.190
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:26.660
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.560
Just sing.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.830
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.170
The two are one

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:44.610
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.110
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.650
What’s with that guy!

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.460
Calling people failure and judging them!

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.230
Blah blah blah blah blah blah!
Talking like a wise guy!

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.530
I’m in a bad mood!

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.660
Hinata, you say something!

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.060
Get that guy!

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.440
Show that guy that people
can really change!

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.270
