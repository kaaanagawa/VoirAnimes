WEBVTT

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.060
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.130
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.930
At the final moment push hard

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.100
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.140
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.380
Gently open your heart

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.910
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.340
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.180
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.620
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.350
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.690
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.090
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.000
If “Heaven” does not exist,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.770
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.730
If “Earth” does not exist,

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.500
run the fields in search
of an advantage.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.540
Open the series of Heaven and Earth,
and the perilous way shall be redressed…

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.340
This is namely the secret of
“the one that guides…”

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.210
What’s that?

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.820
It probably has to do with the scroll.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.990
I think this means we’re supposed
to open the Heaven &amp; Earth scroll.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.170
Okay then, I’m going to open it.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.180
Huh? What’s this?

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.580
A man…?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.850
A person…?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.630
This is…a Summoning Jutsu!

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.860
Naruto! Sakura!
Let go of the scroll!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.800
Oh...

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.580
Wha--?!

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.550
Y-You…

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.560
Hi!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.560
It’s been a long time.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.500
Surviving the Cut!
The Rookie Nine Together Again!

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.470
W-What’s going on?

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.110
It appears you guys have had
a rough time of it.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.380
What?!

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.320
Why are you appearing with
a Summoning?

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.550
At the end of this second exam,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.520
we Chunin are to
welcome the test-takers.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.860
I just happened to be given

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.130
the important task of being
the messenger for you guys.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.400
Messenger…?!

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.140
Just in time.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.540
Everyone…

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.880
Congratulations on surviving
the second exam.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.620
To celebrate your passing,

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.320
I’d like to treat you to
some Ichiraku ramen, but…

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.690
Ohh... Cool!

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.760
Uh-oh…

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.420
H-Hey, Naruto!

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.560
– Listen to the end…
– Cool! Cool!

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.460
Ramen! Ramen! 					Believe it!

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.900
I’ve done great job!
I’m the greatest!

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.800
I so want to eat ramen!
Believe it!

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.770
He’s got so much energy.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.870
Yaaaay!

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.080
Shut up!

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.550
Man, that scatterbrained part
of you is the same as always, eh.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.050
I see.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.920
Huh?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.590
If we had looked at the scroll
in the middle of the exam,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.890
what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.270
Sasuke, you’re a sharp one,
as usual.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.510
You guessed right.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.540
The rules of this exam were to test
your conclusive mission execution ability.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.550
To put it simply,

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.690
in the case of the scrolls being opened
contrary to the rules…

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.750
In the case of them being opened…?

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.560
I was ordered to knock unconscious
the test-takers in front of me

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.400
until the end of the exam.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.540
Good thing you didn’t open the scroll.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.870
Kabuto, thank you!

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.880
Phew!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.550
That was seriously close…

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.820
Oh yeah, Sensei!

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.820
Huh?

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.550
By the way,
what’re the letters on that wall?

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.220
They’re kind of vermiculated and

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.690
we don’t understand
their meaning at all.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.860
Never mind, never mind!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.800
We passed!

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.540
No…explaining that is
one more of my duties.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.470
What, really?

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.540
I’m saying that’s right.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.340
Give it a read.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.980
These are Chunin instructions
Master Hokage recorded.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.750
Instructions?!

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.020
That’s right!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.190
Heaven in this text
refers to the human head.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.560
Earth refers to the human body.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.590
No kidding…

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.360
If “Heaven” does not exist,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.300
enrich your knowledge,
and prepare for the chance.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.670
In other words…

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.540
If your weaknesses are
inside your head, Naruto…

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.340
learn various logics in
preparing for your missions.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.680
Hah! So meddlesome!

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.110
If “Earth” does not exist,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.650
run through the fields
in search of an advantage.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.850
If your weaknesses are in
your physical strength, Sakura,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.560
it means you must not
slack off on your daily training.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.360
And if you combine both
Heaven and Earth…

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.130
Any perilous mission is the right way…

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.440
In other words…

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.840
what can also be called a rule
of might and become a safe mission.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.840
Then, what about
the spot with the missing letter?

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.550
The letter refers to Chunin.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.550
The one letter for “person” that
was in the scroll from earlier goes there.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.390
These five days of survival
were to test

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.030
the test-takers’ fundamental
abilities as Chunin.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.560
And you guys cleared it in fine style.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.670
Chunin is of unit-leader class.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.170
They have the responsibility
of leading a team.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.670
Be more deeply aware of
the necessity of physical strength…

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.940
and knowledge in missions!

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.880
I want you to take on
the next step,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.110
never forgetting these
Chunin instructions.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.420
That is all of the messenger task
I was given.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.560
Got it!

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.070
Huh?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.980
But, as for the final third exam,
don’t push it too far.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.450
Especially you, Naruto.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.410
– You’re the biggest worry…
– Iruka Sensei.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.320
From when I received the
Leaf headband,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.590
I was no longer
an Academy student, you know?!

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.590
There’s nothing to worry!
Believe it!

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.560
Also, this is the proof you
gave me that I’m full-fledged, right?!

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.070
That I’m scatterbrained may
not have changed,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.470
but I’m not a kid anymore!

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.070
I'm now...

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.210
A Ninja!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.820
I see.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.720
I’m sorry, Naruto.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.430
I know their strength the best.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.760
If it’s futile anyway,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.770
I would like to give them
the final word personally.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.340
If you’re that hung up on it,
I can leave that team to you.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.680
To think you’d play the devil’s advocate…

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.840
Thank you very much.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.550
But, they’re Kakashi’s, right?

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.850
If he’s the one who
recommended them,

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.550
I thought I could count on them.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.560
Stay out of it!

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:21.570
They’re not your students anymore.
They’re my subordinates now.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.610
The one who might truly understand

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.810
the strength of these kids.
might be you, Kakashi.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.690
How is it?

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.260
Does the Curse Mark still hurt?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.490
No.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.560
Thanks to you,
it’s gotten quite a bit better.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:59.540
Anyway, Orochimaru is one
of those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.410
He’s a S-rank bingo book
rouge Shinobi

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.140
who even the Anbu couldn’t touch, right?

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.480
I heard that he’d already died, but…

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.320
Why’d he come to this village now…?

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.090
There’s a kid I want, you see.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.400
This kid inherits the abilities
of the Uchiha clan, so…

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.270
It's...

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.540
It’s probably Sasuke, right?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.680
Huh?!

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.940
Master Anko!

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.620
Twenty-one second exam
finishers have been confirmed.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.390
As for the third exam, according
to the regulations of the Chunin Exams,

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.550
preliminaries are planned for
the first time in five years.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.960
The second exam is over.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.270
For the time being,
continue the exams as is,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.540
but while keeping
an eye on his movements.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.570
Yes…

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.560
First off, congratulations on
finishing the second exam.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.800
There were seventy-eight
test-takers for the second exam.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.730
To think twenty-one have
made it this far.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.540
I said to make it less than half,
but I’d really thought about single digits.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.650
I’m hungry!

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.920
There are still this many remaining?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.560
This is such a major pain.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.330
Sasuke and others have passed, too.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.200
Of course…

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.140
We went to that much trouble
to save them…

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.110
It’d all be for naught if they didn’t pass.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.450
Your team didn’t do too bad.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.050
I guess they were lucky.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:28.590
But as long as my team is around,
they can’t go any higher.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.560
After all, whether you
like it or not,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.560
ability talks at the next barrier.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.530
Well, adolescence can sometimes
be bittersweet and

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.630
can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi…

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.570
Did you say something?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.540
Oh my God!

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.810
Not bad, my rival Kakashi.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.450
But that part of you is so hip...
which is what annoys me!

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.480
So that’s Guy Sensei’s eternal rival, eh?

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.820
Guy Sensei totally loses visually…

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.930
Guy Sensei is the hippest
of all the teachers!

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:09.190
He shines!

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.030
Okay!

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.800
Please watch, Guy Sensei!
I’ll shine, too!

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:34.990
I don’t ever want to see
tears of those dear to me again.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.090
So…

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.720
I won’t ever lose again!

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.760
Guy Sensei.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.200
Sure enough, the outstanding candidates
have gathered.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.130
Sasuke Uchiha, eh?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.510
I’ll get you back for my arms,
Sasuke Uchiha…

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.540
At any cost.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:16.230
To think a mere seven teams
are left of the twenty-six…

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.930
Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.900
Akamaru’s acting strange…

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.940
Those Sand Village guys…

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.550
Naruto passed, too.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.820
Thank goodness…

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.860
What, all the Leaf Village
rookies are here.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.560
Say! Say!

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.790
Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei and
even Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.260
It feels like everyone’s assembled.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.430
Humph…I don’t have a very good feeling.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.170
To think this many are left…

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.540
Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies…

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.810
So that’s why they fought
 in recommending them.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.550
Now then, we will now have
the explanation of the third exam

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.050
from Master Hokage.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.320
Listen carefully, everybody!

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.430
Now then, if you will,
Master Hokage.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.030
All right.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:35.140
Before the explanation of
the third exam that we will start from now,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.540
I have just one thing I want
to tell everyone flat out.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.020
About the true purpose of these exams.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.720
True purpose…?!

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.160
Why do allied nations conduct
the exams on a conjoint basis?

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.320
Huh?

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.700
Raising the levels of the shinobi
and friendship among allied nations.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.570
It won’t do to have the wrong idea
of the true meaning of that statement.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.000
These exams are so to speak…

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.540
So to speak…?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.620
A microcosm of battle
between allied nations.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.550
What does that mean?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.560
If we look back on history,

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.560
the allied nations of today were
once neighboring nations

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.460
that continued to vie with
each other and battle for power.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.270
In order to avoid a futile crushing
of each others’ military strength,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.210
those nations mutually selected
a place to battle.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.540
And that was how the
Chunin Exams originally began.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.090
W-Why do we have
to do such a thing?

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.090
We’re not doing this to
select Chunins?!

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.760
There is no question that these exams
are to select Shinobi

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.400
worthy of becoming Chunin.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.230
But on the other hand,

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.640
these exams also provide a venue

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:17.540
for Shinobi who carry their nation’s pride
on their backs to fight for their lives!

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.940
Nation’s pride…?

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.120
Many feudal lords and those of
prominence from many nations

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:30.920
who request Shinobi for work
are invited to this third exam as guests.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.560
And, the feudal lords and
Head Ninja of each Village

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.760
of the nations will watch your battles.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.900
If the gap in national power
becomes unbridgeable,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.940
the strong nations are inundated
with job requests.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.970
The requests of nations deemed
weak, on the other hand, decline.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.540
And therewithal,

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:59.350
we can exert pressure upon
each neighboring nation...

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.650
That is to say, just how much military
strength our Village is developing and has.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.960
Even so, why is it necessary for
us to fight for our lives?!

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.960
The nation’s strength is
the Village’s strength.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.600
The Village’s strength is
the Shinobi’s strength.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:21.270
And the true strength of the Shinobi
is created only in a fight for one’s life!

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.980
This exam is a place to see
the strength of home country Shinobi,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.050
and a place to display this as well.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.050
It is because it’s an exam where
you truly fight for your life

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.320
that this has meaning.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.560
It’s for this very reason that
your forerunners fought in this exam,

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.560
a dream worth striving for.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:47.560
Then why…
use the expression “friendship”?!

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.130
I said it at the start, didn’t I?!

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.540
That it won’t do for you to have
the wrong idea of the meaning!

00:19:54.770 --> 00:20:00.710
It’s a custom where balance is
preserved by fighting and removing life.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.810
This is the friendship
of the Shinobi world.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.480
This is a fight for life with
the pride of the village and

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.550
one’s own dream on the line.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:18.400
Heh, I’m convinced.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.230
Anything is fine.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.540
Just tell us the content of
that fight-for-life test.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.540
Very well.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.810
Now then, this is where I’d like to
explain the third exam.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.580
But actually…

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:42.720
Master Hokage, please allow me,
Hayate Gekko,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.390
who was given the task of judge,
 to speak first.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.760
I leave it to you…

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.560
Nice to meet you, everyone…

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.900
Umm, there’s something…
I'd like you all to do...

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.470
before the third exam.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:22.360
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:30.570
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:40.110
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:48.490
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:55.390
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.200
You won't have to search around you

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.800
It’s all ok now.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:11.640
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:17.210
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.560
Just sing.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.860
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.200
The two are one

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:39.540
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.140
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.120
What's the idea?
Sudden preliminaries?

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.990
Didn't we just get to the tower?
Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.560
It's too much for you, Sasuke!
Please, drop out!

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.060
You're in no condition
to fight properly!

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.400
No matter what you say,

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.430
I'm going to tell the teachers
about that bruise.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.540
Next episode: "Narrowing the Field:
Sudden Death Elimination!"

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.670
Sasuke, I'm scared.
