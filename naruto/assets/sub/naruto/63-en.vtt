WEBVTT

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:09.770
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:18.020
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.310
One more time

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.020
Are you really happy

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.560
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.270
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.940
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.560
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.810
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.890
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.890
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.020
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.890
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.890
One more time

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.480
Hit it or Quit it:
The Final Rounds Get Complicated!

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.900
You…

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.730
You did it!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.850
So that fox kid can fight like this…

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.440
That was awesome!

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.890
Well done!

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.980
That was a great fight!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.150
Yay!

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.440
And he still has the energy
to run around…

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.890
Man… He’s got crazy stamina that guy…

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:57.940
That Naruto…

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.890
He keeps getting stronger…

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.100
He did it…that kid.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.730
Yeah! He’s on the right track!

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.770
And he’s a little cute…

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.150
Something about it…

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.810
I’m envious of you…

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.890
Watching your battle makes me think
that I have to work really hard too…

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.020
That’s amazing, you know?

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.150
He won. Is it for real?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.890
I thought he was the same as me,
in the not going anywhere class…

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.600
Not going anywhere?

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.980
Now people are squealing...

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.900
Looks like he’s part of the group
that’s going somewhere.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.600
Maybe I couldn’t beat him…

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.600
This is really bad.
lt kinda depresses me…

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.560
To retain himself and draw out
the Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox…

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.890
Yeah… Most of the Leaf Village people
here are surprised.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.440
That Naruto…

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.100
When did he learn to control the strength
of Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.400
Even a bird who gets caught,
once it learns how,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.020
will open the lid of its basket
with its own beak.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.980
He won't give up, for he wants to
fly freely in the sky again.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520
This time you lost!

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.890
Father…

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.890
It’s okay, there’s no damage
to his internal organs.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.890
It seems like his Chakra
is almost used up.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.400
You are not the only one special.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.020
Why do you act against
your fate that much?!

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.850
Because I was called a failure…

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.890
Those who become Hokage
are born to that fate.

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.690
So what?!

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.100
Lord Hyuga!

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.850
I’m sorry but…
Could you step out for a moment?

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.650
B-But…

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.150
It won’t take long.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.650
Y-Yes.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.440
What do you need from me?

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.730
That day…

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.690
I came to tell you the truth…
about that day.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:54.940
That day…?

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.190
At that time, I intended to die!

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.400
W-What are you talking about?!

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.520
That day my father…

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.890
He was killed
as your body double!

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.770
The truth of that day…is here.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.190
They're probably only excuses made
at the convenience of the head family.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.890
The person you are now…
should be able to understand.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.890
This writing…!

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.560
Neji… I only have a little time left.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.980
I want to use that limited time
to convey something to you…

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.230
Convey something to me?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.520
The head of Ninjas from the
Land of Lightning,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.690
who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,
was killed by Lord Hiashi…

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.020
But the Land of Lightning didn’t
acknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.980
made only the killing
of the head Ninja a problem,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.560
and made unreasonable demands.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.890
It can’t be helped.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.650
With my one life,
the village can be saved…

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.890
Wait, Hiashi. Don’t be so hasty!

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.480
The Hyuga’s Kekkei Genkai
is an important strength of this land.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.980
It is the duty of the head family
to protect it forever…

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.810
However, for the sake of that duty…

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.230
if we involve our land
in a desperate war…!

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.890
I understand that!
That’s why…

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.100
Isn’t that why
we have branch families?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:32.940
Hizashi’s corpse…
We’ll hand it over as your body double.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.480
Hizashi too…
understands the situation.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.650
However, what they want is
the secret of the power of the Byakugan.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.270
The point in time that
Hizashi becomes a corpse,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.690
that power will be sealed.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.310
I don’t believe that the Land of Lightning
will consent to that.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.350
That’s their true intent,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:10.350
but the condition made by Lightning is to
“Hand over Hiashi Hyuga’s dead body.”

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.890
We pretend that we agreed
to their terms,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.730
and hand Hizashi,
who is identical to you, over...

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.650
and they can’t pursue it
any further than that.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.770
B-But…

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.890
Hiashi… The time has come…

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.650
Your predecessors have done the same
to protect the power of Hyuga clan.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:38.900
Even siblings…
have the heart to write each other off.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.890
That is the fate of the head family.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:51.400
And this…is the destiny of
ones born into Hyuga!

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.890
Where has Lord Hiashi,
who is always bullish, go?

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.600
The scale of this issue is different
from the ones in the past!

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:01.980
It’s not that easy…

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.440
H-Hizashi…you…

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.560
Please…let me go.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:28.350
You… You…have Neji.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.890
Why do you choose death…
for the head family?!

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.810
That’s not so!

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.980
I have been resenting
the head family.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.060
To tell the truth
even now I’m bitter.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.020
That’s why…

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.270
I want to die protecting you as
“my brother,” not as the head family.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.440
It’s the first time I’ve had
the freedom to choose.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.270
I’ve only shown Neji my ugly side.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.190
However, now I’ve come here
and finally know my own intentions.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.520
So please tell Neji…

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.310
I-I wasn’t killed to protect
the head family…

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.730
but to protect my siblings,
family and the land…

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.890
by my own will I chose death!

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.440
T-To choose death…
you call that freedom…?

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.690
Big brother…

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.690
Once, just this once,
I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.310
I wanted to choose my own fate.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.060
That’s all.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.310
Overcome your own fate, Neji…

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.400
Fate is something you work out
with your own hands.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.520
Father…

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.520
This is…the truth!

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.890
I’m sorry!

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.350
Please…raise your head.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.560
Father…

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:54.020
I wonder if a person’s destiny is
only floating like a cloud in a fixed current…

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.480
Or is a person able to ride
on the current that he chooses.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.890
I don’t understand it well yet.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.890
Whichever, the end point
might still be the same…

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.060
Just, when the choice is the latter…

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.890
people turn toward the goal of
living and work hard toward it.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.650
And those who hold that
are really strong.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.890
I feel like I finally understand,
through this battle…

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.890
And… father…

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.600
I have only one goal…

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.690
I want to become stronger,
so I won’t lose to anyone.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.650
That’s how I feel now.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:42.190
Father…I see many birds flying.
And they seem to be enjoying themselves.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.230
It’s buzzing.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.770
That’s because it was a good battle…

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.560
Certainly, there’s that too, but…

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:09.230
It’s likely that, for the curious heads
of Ninja and the feudal lords,

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.600
there is no match they look forward to
more than this next match.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.480
By the way, it seems that
he wasn’t seen at the opening ceremony…

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.270
He’s arrived here already, hasn’t he?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.190
There’s been no news of Sasuke.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.400
And there’s the issue of Orochimaru.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.560
Before everyone starts to make noise,
we should disqualify him…

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.060
What’s going on?!
Hurry up and start the next match!

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.890
How long are you going to
make us wait!

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.560
Before night falls!

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.600
I wonder what’s going on
with the next match?

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.480
Is Sasuke here?

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.190
Sasuke…

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.980
That guy…
What in the world is he doing?!

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.770
Is he planning
not to show up?

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.480
A wise man never courts danger…

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.480
A wise judgement…is it?

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.400
What are you saying?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.400
He’ll definitely come! Believe it!

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:35.350
But seriously, what is he doing?

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.890
Keep this up and he…
he’ll be disqualified.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.890
There’s no choice…

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.560
Sasuke is…disqualified.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.270
Yes.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.690
Sasuke Uchiha is…disqualified?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.890
It has to be done.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.890
What in the world are
we going to do?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.770
If that guy doesn’t show up,
our plan of strategy…

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:02.690
This isn’t good…

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.400
Could he have…?

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.890
Where are you going, Gaara?

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.020
I’m going to confirm my existence…

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.100
Darn that Gaara…

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.890
I wonder if he really killed him…

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.190
Sasuke one more time…

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.560
What happened?

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.520
It’s obvious that you’re there
standing with the thirst for blood.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.980
Why don’t you come out?

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.890
It’s you…

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.440
Lord Hokage…

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.480
I want you to consider waiting a little bit
for Sasuke Uchiha’s disqualification.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.810
I understand your point, but…

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.890
No matter how excellent the Shinobi,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.890
to make light of time is not
a qualification for Chunin.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.600
If there’s no clear reason to satisfy

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.850
the heads of Ninja and feudal lords
who are here,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.770
there’s no reason to wait for him!

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.350
I see…

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.850
Well then, there is a sufficient reason.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.270
Including myself…

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.560
most of the heads of Ninja and
feudal lords that are here…

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.100
came here because
they want to see the next match.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.600
However…

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.480
He’s the remaining survivor
of the “Uchiha.”

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.350
Land of the Wind too, absolutely,
is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.230
Lord Hokage…

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.890
There’s no guarantee that
Sasuke will come but…

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.850
All right then…

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.690
We shall specially postpone
this match and wait.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.690
Lord Hokage! Really…

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.980
Inform so to the Proctor!

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.310
Y-Yes.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.730
However…

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.270
It’s rare for you to insist like that,
Lord Kazekage.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.940
Well…

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.810
To show off the Shinobi’s qualities
of our village to the feudal lords…

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.310
there’s no better opponent
than an Uchiha.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.560
It’s a chance for us as well.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.100
C’mon, what happened to the match?!

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.890
What happened to Uchiha?!

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.900
I understand…

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:56.350
Everyone! The candidate for the
next battle has not arrived here!

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:02.350
We’ll briefly postpone this battle
and start the following battle ahead of it.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.890
What is he doing…that Sasuke?

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.890
Great, so Sasuke didn’t get disqualified!

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.980
That’s good…

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.900
Hey! That means my match
is one match closer!

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.150
Then, on to the next pair!

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.850
Kankuro and Shino Aburame!
Come down!

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.190
My match…doesn’t matter at all.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.890
More importantly…

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:46.940
I'd rather not expose the Mechanism
of Crow to the enemy before the plan…

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:50.890
Proctor!

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.520
I abstain!

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.350
What?!

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.940
I abstain!
Please advance the matches!

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:17.690
Due to Kankuro’s abstention,
Shino Aburame wins by default!

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.190
What’s that all about?!

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.230
Have a proper match!

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.850
You are…?

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.520
It’s my turn, isn’t it?

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.310
It seems that you’re really fired up.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.560
Okay, let’s go to the next match.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.690
Hey! The last one, come down!

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.900
Hey! Hey! What are you doing,
frivolously building things up?

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.730
I mean, why does only
my match have to be modified?

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.480
Shikamaru Nara! You!

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.890
Damn…
lf it’s like this I’ll abstain too…

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.230
C’mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.060
Damn that Naruto…

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:29.600
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.890
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.480
Three! Masala masters Yoga
but hates curry

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.850
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:46.150
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:53.520
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.350
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.810
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.020
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.440
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:23.730
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:30.980
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:37.650
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:44.890
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:53.940
Go! Shikamaru!

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.690
It looks a bit strange that Shikamaru
is fighting in the Final Round.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.770
He's good, firing up, burning up!
That's my teammate!

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.060
But, doesn't he seem spaced out
looking at the sky?

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.890
He totally looks so ambitious.
All right, Shikamar!

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.810
Keep it up and 					attack hard!

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.980
Nex time, "Zero Motivation:
The Guy with Cloud Envy!"

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.650
Ino, your cheering is kinda scary.
