WEBVTT

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:09.730
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.980
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.280
One more time

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.980
Are you really happy

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.530
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.230
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.900
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.530
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.770
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.770
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.820
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.980
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.820
One more time

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.480
Your destiny is to lose to me.
For sure.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.820
You don’t know until you try!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.530
Your father was killed a long time ago

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.070
and I don’t know the extent
of the pain you’ve felt…

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.280
But it’s a huge mistake for you to think
that has determined your entire destiny!

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.440
You’re hopeless…

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.770
Proctor…it’s over.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.190
You failure…

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.570
A Failure's True Power

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.360
Don’t…run away.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.770
I won’t…run…

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.190
I’ll…stand by my own words…

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.820
That’s my Ninja Way!

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.770
I’ll…

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.280
stand…

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.190
by my own…

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.400
words!

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.770
That’s my…Ninja Way…

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.770
I think I’ve heard that line before…

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.690
You with your destiny stuff…

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.940
I won’t lose…

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.110
to a jerk with cold feet like you,
no matter what!

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.070
Naruto…

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.690
A brat who knows nothing
shouldn’t lecture arrogantly!

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.400
People are born burdened with
an inherent destiny that they cannot defy.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.360
Neji…live…

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.940
You’re a man who is blessed
with Hyuga ability

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.770
more than anyone in the family…

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.110
I wanted you…to be born
into the head family…

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.570
You can’t possibly understand

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.770
the destiny of being burdened with
a mark that cannot be wiped off for life!

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.190
Yeah…

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.940
I do understand it.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.440
So…what of it?

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.770
This brat!

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.440
Don’t be acting cool…

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.650
It’s not just you who’s special!

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.400
Hinata was also…
suffering the same as you!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.480
Even though she’s the head family,
not being acknowledged as such…

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.110
trying desperately to change herself…

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.690
She fought you while coughing
up blood with that in mind!

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.530
You too!

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.690
The branch family that
protects the head family…

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.030
Doing all that to Hinata
just because it’s an exam.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.770
In actuality, you were just as frantic

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.360
in attempting to go
against destiny, right?

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.610
Vitality has returned to Hinata’s face!

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.770
Just what I’d expect of
the Anbu Black Ops…

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.770
She'll be okay.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.730
Now she needs bed rest.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.940
Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut…

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.030
How are you, who can’t use Chakra
for awhile, planning to fight?

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.980
At the end of the day,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.570
you and Miss Hinata have
the same destiny!

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.770
Shut up!

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.030
With your Byakugan, labeling people
and talking like you understand!

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.820
Then…show me whether what
you’re saying is true or not.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.770
I will! I’ll defeat you no matter
what and prove that to you!

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.110
Dang it… Dang it!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.230
That being said, I don’t feel Chakra at all.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.190
It feels like when I used up
my Chakra in the training.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.690
You possess two kinds of Chakra…

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.610
You must extract and utilize, at any time,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.570
the other huge Chakra that
has rested inside you from the start…

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.070
That’s it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra…
I’ll use that…

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.570
Stinking fox… 					Help me out!

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.230
This is as far as the talking goes.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.360
Proctor… I’m going to fight with
the intent to kill him!

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.770
If you’re going to stop me,
please feel free.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.900
Jeez.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.820
Didn’t I tell you it is pointless?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.440
This time, I really can’t lose!

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.770
I’ll win no matter what!

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.150
It’s futile…I pressed the Chakra Points…

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.280
No matter what…

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.780
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come
watch me kick that Neji’s butt!

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.900
A failure beats down
a genius with effort…

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.820
His opponent might be me…

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.440
But even if that’s you, Naruto,
no hard feelings.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.730
Why do you try to go against
your destiny that much?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.110
Because I was called…

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.770
a failure!

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.440
No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.280
What’s the meaning of this…?

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.770
H-He…! 					What in the world…?!

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.110
W-What is he…?!

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.030
It can’t be… This Chakra!

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.770
T-That’s…impossible!

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.570
No way! His Chakra Points
have been pressed!

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.900
This Chakra…
lt’s the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt…

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.940
When did he master
the Nine-Tailed Fox’s Chakra…?!

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.650
Here I go!

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:45.980
It’s twisting…

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.190
What’s that?!
ls that even Chakra?!

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.780
Awesome power.
More so than during the training…

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.150
I feel it!

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.770
Rotation!

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.030
What?!

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.900
His speed’s gone up!
What in the world is going on?!

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.690
You!

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.610
You’re confident in close combat, right?!

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.530
You’re going to become the Hokage…?

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.400
I don’t… think so.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.360
Only a very small percentage of
Ninja are chosen to be the Hokage!

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.770
Look more at reality!

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.650
Those who become the Hokage
are born with destiny.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.770
It’s not something you become
by trying to become it.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.780
It’s determined by destiny.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.770
People must live within
their different respective currents

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.280
that can’t be gone against.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.730
I don’t know what the
Hyuga destiny of hatred is!

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.770
But if you’re going to say it’s futile,
you don’t have to do anything!

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.610
This is bad! I must use the Rotation!

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.570
After I become the Hokage…

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.690
I’ll change Hyuga!

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.770
What Chakra…

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.770
That kid showed some enormous strength…

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.570
The Hyuga kid is probably…

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.110
Say! Which one’s Naruto?!

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.360
I don’t know, either!

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.770
Neji’s Rotation is a technique
where the body rotates,

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.190
and dodges and
repels the opponent’s Chakra!

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.030
It looks like there was
more damage done to Naruto

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.820
since he plunged right into the Rotation.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.780
There’s no Genin that can beat Neji…

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.030
But Naruto, you’re incredible…

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.770
To think you’d force him this far…

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.690
Failure boy…
Sorry, but this is the reality…

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.360
Now this is really the en…

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.150
My body…

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.230
So he left a Shadow clone in the hole
and spotted a chance to win, huh…

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.770
Believing in victory,
thinking about what’s next

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.770
and acting even when getting
knocked around, huh…

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.770
The power of believing in oneself.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.650
That becomes the power
to change destiny…

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.730
He knows this…
And he’s a natural to boot.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:24.730
In those conditions,

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.190
you used the Shadow Clone Jutsu
just like that…

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.770
The Ninjutsu that you’re good at, huh?

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:30.770
I was careless…

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.320
I’ve…failed the graduation
exam three times…

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:44.860
As luck would have it,

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.070
the Ninjutsu tests that appeared
on the graduation exam were always…

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:53.230
infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.360
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu…
I stunk at.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.820
Don’t be whining about boring stuff
like destiny and what not,

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.770
and how it can’t be changed!

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.030
Because unlike me…
you’re not a failure.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.360
Winner of this match is Naruto Uzumaki.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.570
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.820
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.770
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:46.110
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:53.480
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.320
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.770
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.980
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.400
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:23.690
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:30.940
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:37.610
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:44.770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.190
Yahoo! I've won! I've won!

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.530
Hey Naruto…

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.900
Don't you think I was so cool?!

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.440
Don't get so carried away!

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.690
Sakura…?

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.820
Sasuke hasn't arrived here yet.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.770
What's up with that kid,
making Sakura worry so much?

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:16.770
Nex time, "Hit it or Quit it:
The Final Rounds Get Complicated!"
