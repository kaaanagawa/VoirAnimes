WEBVTT

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.490
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.990
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.610
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.200
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.610
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.610
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.280
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.110
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.400
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.780
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.070
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.650
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.240
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.740
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.360
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.950
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.650
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.240
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.450
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.740
For a start, wake up
that medium kid.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.950
It will release that Jutsu!

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.570
How do we go about waking him?!

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.490
Give him a good punch!

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.940
But with that said…

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
I’m not particularly good
at transformations…

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.900
Huh?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.940
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.280
Time for a combined transformation!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.820
We got to have fangs and claws!
Let’s go!

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.360
Transform!

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.900
Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.940
F-Fox…?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.150
What a battle…

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.240
I can’t call this place safe either, huh…

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.940
Darn it!

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.110
His power is increasing
more and more!

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.740
Chief! We got to hurry up and rouse
that guy out of his sleep!

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.490
I know that!

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.610
Here goes…!

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.940
Go to hell!

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.030
All right! Now!

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.940
Okay!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.070
Wake the hell up!

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.940
You jerk…

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.820
All right!

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.700
Not that much time has passed
since the medium went to sleep!

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.900
In that state,
one blow should be enough!

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.940
Darn!

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.400
It hasn’t been long since I emerged!

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.940
The Jutsu has been dissolved!

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.940
Even if the Playing Possum Jutsu
is dissolved,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.940
he’s still putting on the pressure?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.610
That guy interfered with my Jutsu…?!

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.360
Sand Coffin!

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.650
– Pop! 					– Yeah!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.940
It’s the chief’s tongue…

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.940
Don’t take me for a fool!

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.820
Darn!

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.030
What kind of strength
does this guy possess?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.700
This doesn’t look good…!

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.950
Both Naruto and I have already
completely disgorged our Chakra!

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.030
You will be killed by me!
I will not cease to exist!

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.110
Leaf Hurricanes!

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.200
Besides just the Sound Ninja,
I wouldn’t have imagined that

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.450
this many of the Sand Jonin
would enter into the village, too!

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.240
Well, it’s understandable.
This is what is called war.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.450
It’s taking much too long.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.940
It’s impossible for a battle
between Shinobi to last this long.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.700
What the heck is happening inside?

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.490
You’re still grabbing my arm…

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.240
I can’t use my Jutsu this way…

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.900
Come on,
let go of me once and for all.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.150
I’m not letting your ambitions
interfere with the village…any longer…

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.530
There’s no stopping my ambitions!
You will die here!

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.360
You old dotard…

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.950
As the Third Hokage,

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.700
are you saying you still have
the power to save this village?

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.360
Do you understand…
the current situation?!

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.400
Many Hidden Sand Shinobi and
my subordinates

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.400
have infiltrated this village.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.200
Your side…the Leaf Shinobi…

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.820
will be annihilated down to
every last woman and child!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.280
I will accomplish the destruction
of the Hidden Leaf Village!

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.650
It’s empty inside!

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.900
There’s nobody there!

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.610
That’s very strange…

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:10.780
Huh?

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.940
Why is there so little resistance
when we’ve closed in

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.490
all the way to the center
of the Hidden Leaf Village?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.150
That’s…

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.940
And also…there’s not one woman
or child in sight.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.280
What is the reason for that?

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.650
Huh?!

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.070
Konohamaru…?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.700
What’s the matter, Konohamaru?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.940
I gotta use the toilet.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.990
M-Me too…

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.940
I do too…

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.360
K-Konohamaru…!

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.400
This is an emergency situation!

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.030
If the enemy finds us,
it will cost us!

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.940
Go back to the other room
and stay quiet!

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.450
I-It’s not that… I gotta pee!

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.900
Hold it!

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.200
I don’t think I can hold it…

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.490
Gimme a break.
ln that case, come along with me…

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.200
Can't hold it!

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.570
Can't! Can't hold…!

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.150
That’s…

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.360
At last, huh…

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.650
I’ll get revenge for you
no matter what…

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.900
Hayate.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.740
That’s the signal. Let’s go!

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.610
Roger!

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.940
You don’t get it, do you, Orochimaru?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.940
Don’t underestimate the Shinobi
of this Village!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.150
Are you all right?

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.530
Yeah…

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.490
Is that…the last?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.900
Yes, the evacuation is complete!

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.530
W-What’s happening?

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.530
The Village Hidden in the Leaves
has an instruction manual

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.780
outlining what to do in case of
a sneak attack by the enemy.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.940
Step One:
Eliminate the enemy’s sneak attack force.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.940
In case one is unable
to eliminate them,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.740
proceed immediately to Step Two.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.990
The immediate evacuation
of noncombatants!

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:44.030
Evacuate the women and children
to shelters around the village!

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.530
When that has been completed,
proceed to Step Three!

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.530
Step Three…?

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.940
Through the collective strength
and efforts of the Village,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.280
eliminate the enemy!

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.740
In that case…!

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.940
The counteroffensive…starts now!

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.570
We will not allow you to take
even one step beyond this point!

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:30.940
Sakura!

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.400
Rescue Sakura,
if it’s the last thing you do!

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.240
I’ll protect Sakura no matter what!

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.400
You will be killed by me.
I will not cease to exist.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.940
My back is against the wall…

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.780
I have to hurry up
and stop that Demon Raccoon…

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.360
Please…

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.570
Just a small amount is fine…

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.650
Give me…

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.940
some Chakra!

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.740
What are you doing…?
There’s only one opponent!

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.490
Hyuga is the magnum force
of the Leaf Village.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.940
Don’t forget that!

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.940
M-My…body…is immobilized…

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.280
Is this the first time
you’re experiencing

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.940
the Leaf’s hidden technique,
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.860
Well, take this too while I’m at it…

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.320
The Leaf’s hidden technique…
Shadow Strangle Jutsu!

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.900
Expansion Jutsu!

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.950
Mind Destruction Jutsu!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.780
W-What’s this?!

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.200
My body is…all on its own…!

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.780
S-Stop…

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.150
Stop!

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.450
Reminds me of the old days!

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.860
Yeah!

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.400
The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.400
Kuromaru…let’s go!

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.320
Right!

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.070
In order to protect the village,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:21.530
all the Leaf Shinobi will risk
their lives fighting!

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:30.940
Real strength doesn't lie
in the mastering of all Jutsu!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.490
The poison in my body is…

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.360
Don’t move, Shino.
I inserted my Parasitic Insects.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.780
They are removing the poison.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.400
Dad…

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.990
I believe I taught this
to you too, in the past…

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.940
It is when one protects
someone important…

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.200
that the true strength of
the Shinobi will emerge!

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.780
I will protect everyone!

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.940
Here I come! You idiot raccoon!

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:10.280
Die…!

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.030
Darn…

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.820
Darn it!

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.950
D-Did he win…?

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.940
A simple head blow…

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.940
His manner of fighting
is incredibly clumsy,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.940
but to think that he could squeeze out
Chakra at that critical stage.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.490
I’ve never seen a knucklehead Ninja
like him before, but…

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.700
he sure is the first phenomenal kid
I’ve seen in a long time.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.490
It’s too bad that I can’t see this through
to the end,

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:15.940
but I’ve reached my limit.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.940
Gamakichi, let’s head home!

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.820
Okay! Pop!

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.940
As might be expected, even I…
am empty now…

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.240
You are too, aren’t you?

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:01.450
We’re much alike…
let’s make this time the last!

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:06.860
It appears that…

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:14.610
I don’t have the strength left
to yank out your entire soul.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.940
However, your ambition ends here!

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.030
Not yet!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.030
There’s no stopping my ambition!

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.030
I have a suitable punishment for you

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:30.820
who have become addicted to the Jutsu
and who have overindulged in the Jutsu!

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.570
I will take all your Jutsu away with me!

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.780
What did you say?!

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.150
There!

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:45.940
Don’t tell me that..?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.030
Stop that!

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.940
Seal!

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.950
My…My arms…

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.610
Now…you can no longer use
either of your arms.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.570
And since you can’t use your arms,
you can’t weave Signs.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.950
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.110
Your ambition of crushing
the Hidden Leaf…dies right here!

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.610
You old dotard!
Give me back my arms!

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.360
Orochimaru, you fool…

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.950
It’s unfortunate that
we can’t leave together,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.950
but, my disciple…

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.070
let’s meet in the other world one day.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.320
You old dotard…
whose life is hanging by a thread!

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.990
How dare you!
How dare you take away my Jutsu!

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.280
In places where the Leaf dances,
a fire burns…

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.940
The shadow of the fire
will illuminate the Village…

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.940
And once more the Leaf will sprout …

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.940
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.940
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:40.360
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.280
It's a secondary role,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.030
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:54.820
But in reaching for that dream,

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.940
Lord Third Hokage…

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.940
The ambition that you had
seems to have been passed on

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:59.780
to the young Shinobi
in the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:05.400
The flame in their hearts will
burn large and strong in the future.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:09.650
And someday,
they will illuminate this Village…

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.940
just as you have done for us!

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.610
Next time:
 "The Third Hokage, Forever…"
