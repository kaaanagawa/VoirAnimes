00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.800
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.550
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.590
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.680
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.100
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.550
All the kids said

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
All the kids said

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.260
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.890
All the kids said

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.350
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.180
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.510
All the kids took off

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.930
into this windless night

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.470
Because they want to change something

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.430
Sakura's Determination

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.600
Where’s Sasuke!
Where did you put him?!

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.390
Heh! You’re Naruto, right?

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.600
You wouldn’t believe anything
I said anyway, would you…?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.590
That’s right! I won’t believe
that Sasuke’s dead!

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.010
Naruto…

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.470
That’s right. Sasuke is alive.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.590
I’ll bring Sasuke back!

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.720
I made that promise!

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.100
Naruto…

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.180
In that case, take me down!

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.350
If I were the wimp I was in the past,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.800
I would probably have
told you the truth.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.050
Arashi!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.970
No! The old Arashi is dead!

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.590
The person you see here
is just a block of flesh

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.890
kept alive by
Ninja Art: Cadaver Puppets!

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.220
Sakura, please look after Sasame!

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.590
Stop it, Naruto! Don’t fight with Arashi!

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.390
No!

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.680
This guy isn’t the same gentle Arashi
you once knew, Sasame!

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.550
Jigumo! Go!

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.800
No!

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.050
Sasame! I'm sorry!

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.350
Over here!

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.050
Naruto!

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800
Don’t, Sakura!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.930
Kamikiri…!

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.970
Finish him!

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.510
Naruto!

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.590
You’re…next…!

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.760
Sakura!

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.890
That was close…

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.850
I almost let my guard down.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.260
Just when you had a chance
to launch a sneak attack.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.600
You blew it, didn’t you, Naruto?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.680
Naruto!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.180
All because of that ball and chain…!

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.590
Ball and chain…?!

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.590
Naruto… I'm sorry!

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.050
That’s not true at all!

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.350
This kind of injury…

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.010
is nothing…at all!

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.180
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.470
If there’s three on your side,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.220
I'll go with five on mine!

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.890
Kamikiri!

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.800
Naruto!

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.260
Are you all right?!

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.600
You’re badly hurt…

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.850
Sakura… This injury is nothing!

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.100
“Sakura…This injury is nothing!”

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.800
Stop it! If you say more than that…!

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.600
I won’t say more! I’ll bring this to an end.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.680
Kamikiri! Jigumo!

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.220
Give me your Chakra…

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.760
Boar, Dog, Rat,
Rat, Snake, Rooster, Dog,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.390
Dog, Monkey, Dragon,
Boar, Boar, Rat, Boar, Dragon…

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.470
Why does Arashi know that technique?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.720
It’s a Hidden Jutsu that only the past chiefs
of the Fuma clan could use…

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.300
What was that?!

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.970
Fuma Ninja Art:

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.180
Spell of the Mandala!

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.590
This ain’t good!

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.300
Naruto!

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.140
What the heck is this?!

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.220
This is the end!

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.590
What?!

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.680
Naruto!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.300
The Chakra cage gradually shrinks…

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.720
And the human enclosed therein
is crushed to the size of a tiny nugget.

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.800
You can’t break it.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.850
As long as I myself do not
dissolve the Jutsu.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.720
Naruto!

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.590
I’m incapable of doing anything…

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.640
There’s nothing I’m capable of doing…

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.590
The person I am now isn’t…

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.430
capable of doing anything!

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.300
Arashi!

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.590
Sasame…

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.720
You!

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.800
Sasame!

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.680
Please…come to your senses…

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.930
Become the old Arashi again!

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.720
I told you, already!

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.930
The old Arashi is dead.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.590
Arashi…

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.600
I’m sorry, Sasame…

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.430
I wanted power…

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.470
I wanted the Fuma Clan to find
a place in the sun once again…

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:33.640
Yes! I understand that!
I understand that!

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.590
But, enough now…
Let’s go home.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.010
Let’s go back to the village.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.350
But, I’m just a mere monster now…

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.550
That’s not true!

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
This is agony…

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.970
Sassme…

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.590
Please… kill me…

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.220
Please…kill…

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.590
How dare you try to kill me!

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.590
Arashi!

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.590
You’ll…die!

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.590
Sakura!

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.590
Sakura?!

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.510
You wanna be… the first to die?

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.970
Sasame taught me that…

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.300
dying isn’t anything to be scared of!

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.850
I see…

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.720
But what’s scary is to live one’s life
without having been able to do anything…

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.260
I’m not afraid to die in the service
of someone who is important to me!

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:00.760
Don’t!

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.600
I’m telling you…

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.930
Whatever happens, you mustn’t die…
No matter what! Sakura!

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.680
Naruto!

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.850
Give it up!

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.590
What is it you think you’re capable
of doing the way you are now?!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.300
That’s so useless!

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.220
Vanish from this world
get crushed into nothing…!

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.510
Sasame!

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.010
Stop that, Arashi!

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.590
Sasame…you!

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:53.930
Naruto!

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.590
Hey! Let go!

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:57.140
No!

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.970
Arashi?!

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.550
I’m sorry, Sasame…

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.800
I caused you so much hardship…

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.590
No, you haven’t!

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.850
The person who experienced
the greatest hardship is you, Arashi!

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.390
Is there anything I can do for you?

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.590
What should I do for you?!

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.680
You’ve already helped me
more than enough…

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.680
See… Thanks to you, Sasame,

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.890
I was able to return to being
the person I was in the past…

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:07.550
Naruto!

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.300
Sakura…

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.350
Even if it’s to be of service
to someone…

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.180
There’s no life that
should be lost for that!

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.590
Yeah!

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.050
Run! Sakura!

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.590
Pervy Sage!

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.100
Sorry to be late!

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.140
I was faced with a number of obstacles
on my end too!

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.590
Gimme a break…

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.140
Now then…
Climb on, climb on!

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.260
Hurry! Let’s get back above ground!

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.590
Oops!

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.050
Sasame!

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.300
She’s fine… She just fainted.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:09.470
Naruto!

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.890
Orochimaru assigned us a mission…

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.590
To make sure nobody takes Sasuke back

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.970
to the Village Hidden in
the Leaves under any circumstances!

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.590
Then, Sasuke is…?!

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.430
Yeah… He’s alive!

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.590
Orochimaru had to protect Sasuke

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.180
because he is his vital vessel which
he will possess in three years!

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.300
Arashi…

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.720
Arashi… This place is gonna collapse!

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:43.930
Hurry up and come over here!

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.140
I’m already just a puppet…

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.590
I cannot live my life anywhere
except here.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.590
Arashi…

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.930
All right!

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.590
No! Arashi!

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.300
Sasame…

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.260
Thank you.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.590
Including Arashi,
we’ve paid an extraordinary price but…

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.430
The Fuma Clan has been
able to cut itself free

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.300
from Orochimaru’s spell…

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.300
You can start again anew.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.590
I will rebuild the Clan again without fail!

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.930
With this life…
that Arashi protected.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.590
Yeah!

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.850
I am truly indebted to you.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.720
Sasame…

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.680
Hanzaki, I’m leaving these two
in your hands!

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.220
Yes, sir!
Please take care along the road!

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.590
I will.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.180
– Thank you!
– We thank you!

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.050
– Take care!
– See you again!

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.510
Hey! Hang in there!

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.600
Well, we weren’t able
to find Sasuke,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.300
but at least we now know
that he’s alive somewhere…

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.430
We’ll have to settle for the fact
that we were able to ascertain

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.850
the new information that we still have
a grace period of three years

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.890
before he becomes a vessel
to be possessed by Orochimaru.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.010
Yes…

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.350
Sasame knew what she needed
to do for her clan…

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.890
But this time again all I did was cry.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.550
All I did was depend on Naruto…

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.590
Sakura!

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.470
You gave your best effort too!

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:10.180
No, I was just a ball and chain
to everyone…

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.510
I wasn’t capable of doing
anything alone…

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.930
That’s not true!

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:21.470
Seeing you give your best effort
like that gave me a lot of courage, Sakura.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:27.590
If you hadn’t been there, Sakura,
I’d have been crushed just like that.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.680
It’s thanks to you, Sakura!

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.140
Naruto…

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:38.470
Wow, you’ve grown into someone
who can say that sort of thing!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:44.680
Oww! I’m an injured man!
Treat me with a little more care!

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.590
Oh yeah, that’s right!

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.590
All I was thinking about at that time
was protecting someone I cared about…

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.470
What I’m capable of
doing right now…

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.550
I was thinking…

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.590
What?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.100
There are many variables such
as mission level,

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.100
or platoon’s member structure…

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.600
But no matter how small
a platoon might be,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.300
I think it’s important to assign
one Medical Ninja to it…

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.550
I know that already…

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.430
I wrote exactly the same thing
in a report long ago

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.760
regarding the survival rate and mission
achievement rate of small platoons.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.760
But it’s not that easy to
nurture Medical Ninja.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.970
They require a different set of skills
than that of fighting types Ninja…

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.590
The minute perfection
of Chakra control,

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.600
the ability to assimilate a huge volume
of specialized knowledge,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.010
the brains to apply that in a broad way…
patience…

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.590
And there is the most important thing

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.180
for Shinobi who are to develop
into a Medical Ninja…

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.720
Well, I’m busy right now, so…

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.510
The most important thing…huh?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.050
Hidden Leaf Hospital
		 I’m all wrapped up in bandages again…

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.350
This way I can’t even
hold chopsticks…

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.590
Sakura, when it’s time for
my meal, feed me, okay?

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.390
I’ll open up my mouth just like this and…

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.140
Huh? Sakura?

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.350
I’m sorry! I was just joking!

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.390
I’m sorry… Naruto…

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.600
Huh?

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.550
This is gonna mean that
I’ll keep you waiting a little but…

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.590
Next time, I definitely won’t…

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.760
be a ball-and-chain to you!

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.970
Huh?

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.590
Enter!

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.300
I came here with a request!

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.010
What is it?

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.590
Please make me your apprentice!

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.590
You’re very desperate, aren’t you?

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.350
Sakura Haruno,

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.180
I heard from Kakashi that you have
a brilliant mind as well as will power!

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.970
All right.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.680
But in exchange,
I’m not gonna be easy on you!

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.430
Yes, ma’am!

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.600
This recent mission…

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.640
looks like it wasn’t wasted
on her, after all.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.930
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:35.390
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:45.850
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:55.590
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.550
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:11.680
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:23.550
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:33.850
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.590
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.850
He makes me so angry,
that Pervy Sage!

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.100
Didn’t he say “I’ll make you
my disciple and hone your skills”?!

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.140
When Sakura’s already become
the Old Lady Tsunade's

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.590
and is working so hard!

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.590
And he just leaves me to
my own devices! Hey!

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.180
All because he was assigned
a mission by Old Lady Tsunade!

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.510
If things come to this,

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.470
I’m gonna give the Old Lady Tsunade
a piece of my mind!

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.220
