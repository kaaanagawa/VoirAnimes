00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.270
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.890
Shikamaru always believed in me…

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.100
More than myself or Neji or
any of us here… He is stronger!

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.690
Let’s go, fatso!

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.520
Don’t YOU say that!

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.560
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.900
Arm!

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.770
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.940
Leg!

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.810
Partial Expansion Jutsu...

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.350
Arm!

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.890
Don’t mess with me! Scum!

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.190
Eat this!

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.150
What!

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.560
Super Expansion Jutsu!

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.560
Good-bye Old Friend!
I’ll Always Believe in You!

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.650
I did it…Shikamaru…

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.890
What?!

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.060
I can’t believe I had to get to
the second state

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.890
for an opponent like this one…

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.890
Slamming Palm

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.150
What…What is that appearance?!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.310
Now that it’s come to this, it’s over.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.890
In the second state, I can put out ten times
more power than I have thus far.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.400
I’m invincible.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.650
It’s too painful to move…

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.020
Who knew that the side effects
of the Curry Pill would be this intense.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.890
This is what happens…

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.810
to a powerless scum for butting in!

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.560
Playing Ninja better suits you!

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.230
Raise your hand if you’re playing Ninja.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.190
Wait…

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.520
Rock, paper…scissors!

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.190
Split!

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.980
One, two, three…

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.890
W-Wait!

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.850
99…100!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.890
Hey! I said, split!

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:19.810
Ouch!

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.480
Found you!

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.440
Give up quietly, the two of you!

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.600
We finally caught ‘em!

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.270
I’m sick of this!
The team with Choji always loses!

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:40.850
Sorry…

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.310
I need a lot of Chakra
for this "second state."

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.520
I’ll take whatever Chakra
you have left!

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.890
Well then, I’ll take them now.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.890
There’s not much left…

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.730
You’re empty!

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.480
I haven’t had nearly enough to eat…

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.900
I said I haven’t had enough to eat!

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.480
Huh…?

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.890
What, just one last piece, huh…

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.600
When I said I haven’t had
enough to eat…

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.350
Just as I thought, you’re the scum
used as a sacrificial pawn.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.060
Die…you pitiful fatso, the odd man out.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.810
I won’t let you play Ninja with us!

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.810
Why?

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.020
Because if we let you play,
we’ll lose.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.850
You’re slow.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.350
Yeah, but…then the number
of people won’t be even.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.890
Japanese chess is fun
because the number of pieces are even.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.890
A piece that is useless is
the same as not having that piece!

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.350
Yeah, that’s right!

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.940
We’re the ones with fewer people
and we’re not complaining.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.270
Hurry up, let’s do it!

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.890
if it’s okay with you, then it’s fine…

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.890
Okay, it’s settled!

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.730
We can win it!

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.100
Yes!

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.100
Where are we gonna hide this time?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.770
And um, the whole Akimichi Clan
is fat and slow…

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.060
That’s what everyone says.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.230
Really...

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:47.690
But Choji, you’re a kindhearted guy…
more than everyone else.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.150
One day, you’ll surely make friends
who’ll see that quality of yours.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.730
And then you should cherish
those friends

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.350
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other…

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.890
Can I really make…friends like that…
someone like me…?

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.230
Rest in peace…

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.770
you’re not the only one
I’m going to get.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.600
After I kill you,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:24.940
I’m going to get the cruel, sleazy,
mean guys who used you as a sacrifice!

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.350
Because he…promised…

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.770
You better catch up with us…Choji.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.890
Okay!

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.650
He’s definitely going to defeat
the opponent and come after us…!

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:52.730
Yep!

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.480
That’s right…he can do it.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.890
Okay! While I’m here…

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.890
Me too…

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.350
All right, everyone,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.270
we get Sasuke back
before Choji catches up!

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.770
Wait!

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.190
All right! Here we come!

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.810
He’s late…that Jirobo…

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.520
He’s greedy and eats so much…

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.810
He’s probably squeezing out Chakra
even from the marrow of their bones.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.850
I wish he had switched
with me already…

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.440
Here, I’ll give it back!

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:56.850
Well, then…

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.520
If I linger,
I won’t be able to catch up.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.890
It’s about time to put an end to this.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.150
The Chili Pepper Pill is left…

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:15.890
But…if I take that…
I’ll die, without a doubt…

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.890
Don’t you dare die, Choji…

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.890
We’ve been doing things together
since that day…

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.890
Oh…! You…

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.650
You…were there just now…

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.020
What about playing Ninja?

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.770
It was a drag,
so I pulled myself out from it.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.310
Huh…?

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.350
By the way, that’s my special seat.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.020
Your special seat?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.520
I like to lie on my back and
look at the clouds on a nice day like this.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.400
You’ve come to look at clouds?

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.890
Mind if I sit there?

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.890
Oh…sure!

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.400
This is a good place.
You can see the clouds well.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:34.690
Yeah…

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.270
Why don’t you…

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.020
What…?

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.890
watch the clouds with me
and lounge around?

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.560
Okay!

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.230
You know! I-I brought snacks.
Want some?

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.520
Oh, that’d be great!

00:12:58.890 --> 00:12:59.730
Thanks.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.810
Eating potato chips
while watching clouds…this is the best.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.730
Yep!

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:16.730
My name is Shikamaru…
from the Nara Clan.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.890
You… What’s your name?

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.690
It’s Choji! Choji Akimichi
of the Akimichi Clan!

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.810
Choji, huh…
I think I’ll get along with you.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.980
Me, too!

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:44.890
We’ll always do things together
from now on, too.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.890
Choji…!

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.270
Shikamaru… Sorry…I can’t go…

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.850
It’s over…

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.060
But, this guy…

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.730
I have to beat him…
even if it means death.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.890
No matter what you do now,
it’s too late!

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.980
Crushing Palm!

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.310
Wh-What’s that…?

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.940
But…

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.690
Boulder Blow!

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.230
It’s no good!

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.560
I’m 100 times stronger than before!

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.890
They say that food
can be a reason

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.890
for people to hold a horrible grudge
against somebody.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:16.020
The blow just now…
was for eating the last bite of my snack…

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.560
No way!

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.230
This guy has so much Chakra that
his body has changed physically!

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:23.560
And this is…

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.310
for making fun of me by calling me
a sacrificial pawn and fat!

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.890
But what I can’t forgive you for
more than anything else …

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.650
You sure do suffer when
you have a stupid leader. You underlings!

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.900
Well… I’ll kill you losers

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:48.810
before you suffer working
under a glum shadow lover like him!

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.310
You should blame your stupid leader
for choosing you!

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.690
You insulted my best friend!

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:05.060
More than mocking me
by calling me fat,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.020
and poaching the last bite
of a four-star meal…

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.190
I can’t forgive you for that!

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.900
All of my Chakra…to my left hand!

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.900
Uh, uh-oh…!

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.060
This blow…is heavier than my life!

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.600
W-Wait…! Don’t be hasty…!

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.520
I…I won.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.190
Me… I won!

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:40.890
Everyone…

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.850
But Choji…

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.770
you’re a kindhearted guy,
more than everyone else…

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:38.400
One day, you’ll surely make friends
who’ll see that part of you…

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.230
And then you should cherish
those friends

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.890
and be the kind of friends
who believe in each other.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.060
“Hurry up and get over here.”
lt’s Naruto.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.890
“Everyone’s waiting.” 					Kiba…

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.020
Shikamaru…

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.900
Ino-Shika-Cho!

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.900
Even if it is just potato chips,

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.060
I won't let anybody else have
the last piece, no matter who you are.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.730
Choji and I have worked as a team
for many years,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.150
so coordinating with him
is easiest for me.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:06.900
Dad…

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.940
I’ve made…a lot of friends…

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.890
What happened?

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.940
Nothin’…

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:32.650
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:38.230
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.520
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:53.890
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:59.400
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.440
Look like a mountain

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.100
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.940
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.270
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:19.520
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.850
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.890
Look like a mountain

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.600
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.890
Look like a mountain

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.020
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.060
Take this!

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.150
Fang Over Fang!

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.900
Byakugan!

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.190
That damn spider bastard!

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:03.480
Me, Naruto, Kiba and Neji.
Our careful planning is not working!

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.100
If we dawdle Sasuke will be gone!

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.650
Hey, what should we do?!

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:10.940
If we want to continue our pursuit,
there’s only one way to do it!

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.770
Next time: “Your Opponent is Me!”
