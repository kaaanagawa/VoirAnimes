WEBVTT

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.160
C'mon!

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.160
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.370
Being chased by something

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.790
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.450
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.200
For no single one,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.990
To none does belong,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.830
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.200
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.000
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.500
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.870
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.830
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.290
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.870
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.370
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.990
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.330
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.250
Rockin' my heart

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.830
Hey, you!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.330
Are you sure you want
to look like that?

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.870
Yes, of course!
C'mon! So hurry hurry!

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.040
Don't regret it later.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990
Say cheese!

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.250
My Name Is Konohamaru!

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.410
I couldn't decide on how to look.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.000
It took me 3 hours to decide.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.450
But as you can see,
it's more like a work of art.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.990
Doesn't it look great?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.410
Take it over.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.580
What?!

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.160
Take it over.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.830
Stop saying that!

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.750
Transform!

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.990
Oh please, Lord Hokage…

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.290
The Sexy Jutsu…
That's quite a devious technique.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.830
By the way Naruto,
where's your headband?

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.660
I won't wear it until the orientation.
lt might get scratched

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.950
Well, that's just fine.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.580
But the Ninja Registration Form
is a very important document

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.540
held in high regard by our village.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.250
Why do you want to look like this?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.370
Because!

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.200
Anyway, how should I know
about all that stuff?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.080
Old man!
Get ready to fight!

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.950
I am going to be the Fifth Hokage!

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.700
Ouch!

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.660
If it's not one thing, it's another….

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.990
Drat! Is this a trap?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.620
Are you okay,
Honorable Grandson?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.990
May I just inform you that
there aren't any traps here…

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.750
Huh? What's with this runt?

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.450
What?!

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.250
I know this kid…
He's that Nine-Tailed boy!

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.990
He's a good-for-nothing scoundrel!

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.620
You must have done this to me!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.830
You tripped all by yourself, stupid!

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.330
Hey! Let go of him!

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.790
He is the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.990
He stopped as soon as
he learned who I am….

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.990
He's like my four-eyed teacher.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.870
He's just like everyone else!

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.950
What's the matter?

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.580
Weren't you gonna hit me, huh?

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.290
Can't do it 'cuz
I'm the Hokage's grandson, eh?

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.990
As if I care! 					lmbecile!

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.620
This guy…

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.080
What?!

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.540
Good grief…

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.750
Listen to me.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.990
You are the Honorable Grandson
of the Third Hokage.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.290
Even though that scoundrel hit you,
you must not associate with his kind.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.410
Nothing good will come of
your tangling with him.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.990
This is your distinguished
teacher Ebisu,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.870
and I am never wrong
about these things!

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500
Don't you want to become
the Fifth Hokage?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.700
Then allow me
to teach you Ninjutsu,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.870
so that your dream will
become a reality.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.080
That's right.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.910
Stick with me and you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.750
Is that clear, Honorable Grandson?

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.830
He's gone!

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.120
It seems he's gone after Naruto.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.990
Oh no!

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.120
This is terrible!

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.120
Honorable Grandson!

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.450
How did he become like this?

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.040
That was the 20th sneak attack today.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.120
And now he's in the company of Naruto.
I'm a bit worried.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.330
I just hope he doesn't pick up
more foolishness.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.700
Huh?

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.540
Stop following me!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:19.620
What is it now?!

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.750
Your camouflage is pathetic.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.910
You've seen through my disguise...

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.990
Your reputation is well-earned.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.700
I will allow you to make me
your apprentice.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.870
But you must first teach me that
 "Sexy Jutsu"  technique

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.990
you used to beat Grandpa Hokage.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.290
You gotta be kidding.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.120
I beg you to say yes, boss!

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.990
Huh?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.200
Boss?

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.990
Boss! Boss! Boss!

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.410
I guess I have no choice.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.990
Listen.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.370
In order to become a skilled Ninja,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.990
you must first learn to
control your Chatora.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.410
Chatora?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.830
Yes, Chatora.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.990
Boss, I think you mean Chakra.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.990
Silence!

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.450
That's what real Ninjas call it!

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.990
Oh! I didn't know that!

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.910
Whew… I'm glad he's a fool.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.990
Listen. Chakra essentially means…

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.120
Basically, it is the energy needed
in order to use Jutsu.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:36.580
Huh?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.580
In other words, fundamentally Ninja Arts
combine the Chakra,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.500
the physical energy accumulated
from each cell in the body

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.540
with spiritual energy intensified
through training and experience.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.040
This combined energy is summoned
with certain hand signs.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.580
You made me think
you knew all that,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:54.990
when you were just reading
from a scroll!

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.950
Much has been said about
perfecting the Ninja techniques,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.990
but it really boils down
to just one thing.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:03.620
And what is that?

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.990
Hard work and guts.

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.160
Hard work and guts?

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.410
That's right.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.250
So be ready for the challenging tasks
I will give you.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.990
Yes, boss!

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.080
Good. Let's start right now.
Transform for me.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:17.990
Huh?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.370
Let me see first
how much you already know.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.450
But what do I transform into?

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.500
OK... First, transform into that lady.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.700
An easy task, boss.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.370
Transform!

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.990
Well, do I look like her?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.160
Uhm… Well, the clothes do and…

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.620
And what's so similar
about that?!

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.250
Honorable Grandson.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.990
If you will transform into me,
at least try to look a little cuter, OK?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.620
She's scary!

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.910
Why am I the one who gets hit?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.620
OK!
Next, we'll do some research on sexiness!

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.990
Yes, boss!

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.990
I told you I don't allow
reading here, Naruto!

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.870
This is the last test.
Put all of your effort into it!

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.410
Yes, boss!

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.080
Transform!

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.370
Naruto! It's you again!

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.160
Why is it always me…?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.250
Sorry.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:16.990
Huh?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.910
It's because
I'm the Hokage's grandson.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:22.990
Don't worry about it.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.790
Huh?

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.660
You're now ready to perform
the Sexy Jutsu!

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.000
You just need more practice.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.700
Yes, boss!

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.370
OK, keep in mind…
the point is for "boom boom boom"!

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.410
Now do it!

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.950
Yes, boss! 					Transform!

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.910
What do you think?

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.040
That won't do!

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.290
More slender.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.540
Yes, boss!

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.620
Is this okay?

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.790
Not yet. 					More attractive.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.990
Yes, boss!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.120
How about now?

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.950
That Naruto… What is he teaching
the Honorable Grandson…?

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.500
Where the hell could they be…?

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.990
I am a distinguished teacher
training potential Hokage.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:27.540
All those who interfere
will be eliminated.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.990
You know I've been wondering…

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.250
You seem obsessed with beating
your Grandpa Hokage.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.870
My name is Konohamaru.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.990
It was Grandpa who gave me
that name.

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.540
He named me after our village.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.250
It should be easy for everyone
here to remember.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.410
But nobody ever calls me
by that name.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:20.950
When they see me, all they see
is the grandson of Lord Hokage.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.620
No one sees me for who I really am.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.580
I can't stand it anymore.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:29.790
That's why…

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.120
That's why I want the title
of Lord Hokage now.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.370
Idiot…Who do you think
will accept you, huh?

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.160
Huh?

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.040
You won't win the title
that easily, you know.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.990
What?!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.620
It's not that simple.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.330
If you're really serious about gaining
the title of Lord Hokage…

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.450
What?

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.990
You'll have to beat me first!

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.990
Lord Hokage!
I've been looking for you.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.500
Iruka.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.990
Did Naruto re-submit
his Ninja Registration Form?

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.000
Yes.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.660
When I lectured to him the other night
at the ramen stand,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.990
he said he will make everyone accept him
now that he's a Ninja.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.290
He's been happy since then.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.990
It might not be easy for Naruto
to realize that dream.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:49.790
Huh?

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.830
As you well know,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.990
only the villagers who fought
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit 12 years ago

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.410
know that the monster is sealed
inside Naruto.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.290
I ruled that no one shall speak
about that incident.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.160
I have severely punished those
who have broken this rule.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.790
Now our children know nothing about it.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.990
That is the only positive
development for Naruto.

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:24.990
Before the Fourth Hokage trapped
the monster and died,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.990
his last wish was for the villagers
to regard Naruto as a hero.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.120
A hero?

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.700
The Fourth Hokage sealed the monster
into the navel of a newborn baby

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.620
whose umbilical cord
had just been cut.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.990
As the receptacle
for the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.450
Naruto saved the village.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.990
Unfortunately, the other villagers
don't see him like that.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.580
Some even say that Naruto is
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit himself.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:02.200
Little by little, that attitude has been
passed down to their own children.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.160
Iruka. 					Do you know?

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.330
What, sir?

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.620
When someone is hated and people refuse
to accept his existence,

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.990
he sees it in the eyes
of the people around him.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.370
I have found you!

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.250
Huh?

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.370
That Demon Fox!!

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.410
That cold look!
lt's always like that!

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.990
Honorable Grandson,
we have to go now.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:44.990
No way!

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.990
I want to beat Grandpa right now
so I can win the title of Lord Hokage!

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.790
Don't get in my way!

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.000
A Hokage must first know about virtue,
honor, etiquette, wisdom, loyalty, faith,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.830
judgment, obedience
and all that.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.290
He must be skilled at more than
thousand techniques…

00:16:59.330 --> 00:16:59.990
And then...

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.790
Transform!

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.160
Take this! Sexy Jutsu!

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.950
What? 					lt didn't work!

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.540
What kind of a
disgraceful spell is that?!

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.700
I am a gentleman!

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.660
Such vulgar attacks
will never work on me!

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.700
Honorable Grandson!
That rascal will only make you an imbecile!

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.870
Stick with me and...

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.040
you will gain a shortcut
towards becoming the Fifth Hokage.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.990
C'mon, let's go!

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.950
No way!

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.700
Shadow Clone Jutsu

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.330
Wow! 					Fantastic!

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.700
Ha! 					That's nothing.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.290
I am a distinguished teacher.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.990
I am not as weak as Mizuki.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.410
Boss…

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.080
Transform!

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.040
Transform!

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.580
Oh, Master Ebisu…

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.990
I call it "the Harem Jutsu"!

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.990
He combined the Multiple Clones with
his own Sexy Jutsu.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.250
That's another devious attack.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.370
I probably won't even survive that one.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.990
I can't even beat that
four-eyed teacher of mine!

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.990
I want the title of Lord Hokage so badly!
I want to be recognized by everybody!

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.990
But I keep failing.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.580
You think it's that easy?

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.290
Huh?

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.330
It's given only to the greatest Ninja
in the village.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.580
Everybody must learn to believe in you.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.620
I've been through a lot already.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.870
It's been one struggle after another.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.990
But after all that,
I found someone who accepts me.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.370
I had to go through a lot...
Just for one person.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.990
You had better push yourself.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:48.290
For what?

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.040
The path of getting the title,
Lord Hokage, is a brutal one.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.080
There's no such thing as a shortcut.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.540
If you're really serious about
attaining the title of Lord Hokage

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.080
You'll have to beat me first.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.620
Who do you think you are,
lecturing me like that?

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.540
I won't be your apprentice anymore.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.620
From now on, you're my rival.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.330
Unfortunately for you,
tomorrow I graduate from the Ninja Academy.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:51.910
Still, I'll consider you an equal someday
when we fight for the title of Lord Hokage.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.330
Let's look forward to that, Konohamaru.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.990
You still have a long way to go
to become a real Ninja.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.990
Aaah! Why do I have to be in
the same group with Sasuke?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.540
The guy I hate the most?

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.790
Sakura keeps saying
 "Sasuke Sasuke Sasuke!"

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.500
and doesn't even
pay attention to me!

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.990
It makes me so mad!
I got it! I'm going to pull one on him!

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.750
I'm not gonna let him be so cool
in front of Sakura!

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.500
Next Episode:
 "Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?"

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.120
Watch my outstanding performance!
