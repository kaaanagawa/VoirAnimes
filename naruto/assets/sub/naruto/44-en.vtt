WEBVTT

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.290
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.220
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.300
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.100
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.270
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.310
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.550
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.150
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.590
It will come, closer

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.590
Now

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.510
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.340
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.520
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.850
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.260
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.850
And the next match.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.990
This year’s rookie looks challenging…

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.600
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.400
It’s here, it’s here, it’s here!

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.200
What we’ve been waiting for!

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.570
It’s finally my turn!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.240
Yeah! Lucky us!

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.310
If it’s this guy,
we’ll absolutely win, Akamaru!

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.180
Show us how much you’ve grown.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.420
I’m going to do it!

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.600
Akamaru Unleashed!
Who's Top Dog Now?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.530
The seventh battle,
Naruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.020
I got sick of waiting!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.620
It’s finally time for me to shine!
Believe it!

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.620
That’s my line!

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.790
With you as my opponent,
I’ve as good as won!

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.990
Right, Akamaru?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.160
Don’t get excited!

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.600
You won’t be able to beat me!

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.100
Why you little…!

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.200
Hey! Don’t bring your puppy!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.740
He’ll get in the way of the match!

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.170
You fool!

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.910
Akamaru’s going to fight with me.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.580
Hey, hey! Is that okay?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.680
Yes.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.950
Animals and insects are treated
the same as ninja tools.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.390
There’s no problem.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.090
Well, that’s fine!

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
It’s a perfect handicap!

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.590
Talking tough!

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.930
Then…

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.100
Akamaru, don’t put a paw in this.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
I’ll fight him by myself!

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.670
Naruto! Don’t lose to a guy like this!

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.470
It’s finally come.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.680
Naruto, huh?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.580
I’m sorry, but he can’t beat Kiba...

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.550
Kakashi.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.950
Naruto...

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.220
I-I want to support you, but…

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.590
Kiba’s on my team…

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.600
Kiba will get mad…

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.200
But…

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.100
Naruto…

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.140
Kiba’s lucky.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.870
Hah!

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.580
Hah! I don’t know how strong he’s become
since this guy became a Genin…

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.580
Today we’ll run through Transformation Jutsu.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.620
You’ll change yourself into Lord Hokage…

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.920
His ability was “that,” so…

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.960
Transform!

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.510
So noisy...

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.310
I was sleeping comfortably…

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.520
T-That was a joke!
I-I did it on purpose!

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.380
Enough, Naruto!

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.590
It’s your third year
at the academy!

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.450
Wha--?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.690
Goodness sake, who is that guy?

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.960
We’ve just switched to this class
and already found someone funny.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.530
That guy, he’s on a roll.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.600
He’s an attention-seeker, huh?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.100
One more time, fool!

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.700
Transform!

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.650
You…

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.180
Is it possible…?

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.960
Hey hey, are you serious?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.230
You’ve been here for three years and
can’t even do a respectable transformation?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.840
All of you watch now!

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.570
I will absolutely someday become
 the true and a real Hokage!

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.980
Lame!

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.580
What Hokage?!

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.560
Some sympathy at the very least…

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.920
I’ll do you in, in one clean blow!

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.600
Really? But you can’t beat me!

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.270
I said not to act tough.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.580
Well then. Please begin!

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.880
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:
All-Four Jutsu!

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:50.590
Here I come!

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.230
Fast!

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.310
It will be a while ‘til
he opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.910
Just as I thought.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.180
That Naruto can’t be equal to Kiba.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.350
Naruto…

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.420
That was too embarrassing to watch.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.590
See…

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.290
What was that?
That guy is weak.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.330
Naruto!

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.330
Huh?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.240
Yes, that’s it…

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.580
I’ll surpass Hokage!

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.590
Then everyone in the village will
acknowledge my existence!

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.590
Those are his words…

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.530
I’ve always made fun of them, too.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.940
This is the Jonin…a true Ninja…

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.570
I have to escape…

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.370
If I stay like this…

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.580
I’ll really, really be killed!

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.380
Are you hurt…

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.550
Scaredy cat?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.590
You just need to become
stronger than me!

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.630
Darn you!

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.470
You!

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.040
What are you doing all of a sudden?!

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:58.850
T-This stupid coward is...
absolutely... not the Sasuke I know!

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.220
Don’t mess with me!

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.420
W-What?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.260
But, it was wrong!

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:18.770
Hey...

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.570
are you hurt?

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.580
Scaredy cat?

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:40.720
I won’t change my words,
that’s my way of Ninja!

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:55.740
Naruto...

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:58.180
Say it to everyone!

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.980
Don't...

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.210
Don't...

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.250
underestimate me!

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.590
Yeah!

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.660
He seems to have grown
to say such thing.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:15.790
Naruto…!

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.800
Go, Naruto!

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.530
What are you talking about,
bleeding like that?

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.600
Your tough talk has gone too far!

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.710
I didn’t use my power fully…
to observe your strength first!

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.340
You too, cut out the tough talk
and use the dog or whatever you want!

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.150
You’ll regret this…

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.580
Let’s go Akamaru!

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.590
Smoke Ball?

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.590
Take this!

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.510
I can’t see!

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.580
This is bad!

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.680
I have to get out of the smoke…
or I’ll be done for.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.220
It worked!

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.790
What is it…?

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.600
Shoot…I can’t see anything.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.580
Yeah! We did it!

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.020
Yay! Good job, Akama--!

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.400
A-Akamaru…

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.600
Why?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.710
Why?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.580
You took the bait!

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.920
Y-You!

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.850
Transform Jutsu?!

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.760
Ouch! Shoot!

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:25.960
Let go!

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.130
You smell like a dog!

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.660
W-Where’s Akamaru?!

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.100
Over here!

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.770
Akamaru! Darn!

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.570
No way!

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.970
That's Naruto?!

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.370
An equal match with Kiba…

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.340
No, it may be more than equal!

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.480
Applying Shadow Clone Jutsu
to Transform Jutsu, that’s a clever trick.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.750
Naruto shouldn’t be able to do that…

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.520
His timing at using Jutsu’s is very good.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.360
What? He’s better than I thought.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.230
But, to get mad like that after
biting the opponent himself…

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.600
What a funny guy.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.830
N-Naruto…amazing!

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.700
That’s amazing, Naruto!

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.840
You got a little bit stronger.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.150
But it’s over.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.210
Next, I’ll attack you seriously.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.950
Oh really?!

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.750
But you will absolutely not beat me!

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.090
During this exam,
he’s matured again.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.560
This is a surprise…

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.600
That’s Naruto, the perpetual goof…?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.600
Evidently it’s no longer “that” Naruto.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:45.570
Yeah.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.140
I wonder, what kind
of trick Kakashi used…?

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.580
Still…

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:01.890
Huh?

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.800
As for the development of
my Kiba and Akamaru,

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.160
it's probably more than Naruto.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.570
Naruto…I’ll take Akamaru... back!

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.220
W-What's this?!

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.990
What did you feed him?
His fur turned red!

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.900
That’s why he’s called “Akamaru”, red boy.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.670
Food Pills huh…?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.840
That Kiba…

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.370
He intends to end it with this.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.970
Here we go, Akamaru!

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.610
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry…!

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.390
Man Beast Clones!

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.600
T-There’s something wrong
with their eyes!

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.600
He’s using some weird drug!

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.600
Isn’t this doping?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600
Is this okay?!

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.240
Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.470
You, that’s all you say!

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.010
What?!

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.140
What did that guy eat?

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.650
It’s Food Pills.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.680
F-Food Pills?

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.220
Food Pills are a secret medicine
that people in the military take

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:45.260
and fight for three days and
three nights without a break…

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.660
They’re high in protein,
easily absorbed and

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.600
have some types of component
that influence agitation or sedation…

00:15:55.630 --> 00:16:00.170
Kiba and Akamaru’s Chakra must
be doubled right now…

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.010
It’s over with this…

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.240
Let’s go!

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.810
All-Four...

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.010
Jutsu!

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.900
N-Naruto!

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.940
That Naruto is in danger!

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.140
Kiba’s the gung-ho fighter type
who will attack

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.180
like a beast with Chakra wired
throughout his body.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.150
And the Food Pills that double one’s
Chakra are quite simply…

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.880
the perfect pill for Kiba.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.750
Naruto…

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.590
This isn’t good…

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.360
There’s no way to counterattack…

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.000
All I can do is gather all
the Chakra in my legs

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.660
and do my best to escape…!

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.830
At this rate…

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.340
Here’s my chance!

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.310
Take this!

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.110
Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.020
Fang Over Fang!

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.000
This is the difference in
our true powers.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:45.880
I'm going...

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.580
to become the Hokage.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.080
I can’t lose here...!

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.790
You? Hokage?!

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.850
When you’re weaker than me?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.590
I’ll become Hokage for you!

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.410
You know deep down inside
that you can’t become the Hokage.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.510
So quit acting tough!

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.720
You’re wrong, Kiba…

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.190
Naruto...

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.720
He’s not that weak…

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:40.700
I’ll receive the name...
of Lord Hokage!

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.540
All of you, just watch!

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.940
Naruto, unlike me...

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.640
he has always believed in his own worth.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.360
I thought it was really amazing…

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.760
It must have been really hard…

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.570
I understand that.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.840
And yet before not even one person…

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.550
tried to see Naruto.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.960
Hey, that’s the kid…

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:43.560
I heard he’s the only one...
who failed.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.660
Humph! Serves him right!

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.700
It’s trouble if a kid like that
becomes a Ninja.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.600
After all, that kid is really…

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.870
Stop! Anything further is taboo.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.580
Nobody tried to acknowledge
real Naruto.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.520
Clone Jutsu!

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.700
But now…

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.570
Everyone’s watching…

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.210
Stand up! Naruto!

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.360
Everyone is acknowledging him!

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.570
If you compete with me for
the name of Hokage…

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:09.010
You…will be the loser!

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:25.600
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:34.040
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:43.650
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:51.920
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.600
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.700
You won't have to search around you

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.500
It’s all ok now.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:15.350
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.680
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.260
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.060
Just sing.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:34.530
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.630
The two are one

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.110
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.580
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.420
That Kiba, he sure is stupid.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.620
Think hard about your Jutsu
when you use them.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.790
Otherwise, your opponents
will take advantage of the Jutsu.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.600
Well, the outcome of you and me
could be seen from the beginning.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.100
The way you’ve torn me apart
up until now,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.600
I’ll give it back all at once!

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.540
Next episode: “Surprise Attack!
Naruto’s Secret Weapon!"

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:18.140
This is the trick I’ve been saving up!
