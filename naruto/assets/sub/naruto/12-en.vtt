WEBVTT

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.920
C'mon!

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.860
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.130
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.540
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.210
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.950
For no single one,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.590
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.960
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.830
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.230
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.600
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.570
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.040
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.620
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.830
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.830
Rockin' my heart

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.110
What's with you?!

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.240
Battle on the Bridge! Zabuza Returns!

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.920
Good morning!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.990
Here.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.520
Thank you.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.830
Naruto didn't come back
last night, either?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.400
He's such a fool,

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.700
he's been out every night,
climbing trees.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.540
He might be dead already
from using up too much Chakra.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080
I wonder if Naruto's okay.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.080
To think a child's out in
the middle of the night.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.820
Well, you don't need to worry.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.820
Although he may not seem to be,
he's a full-fledged Ninja.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.620
I wonder…

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.390
That idiot's probably
all pooped out right about now.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.830
Sasuke?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.230
I'm going for a walk.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.800
But we're about to eat…

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.810
That was fast!

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.740
You'll catch a cold if
you keep sleeping here.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.480
Who're you?

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.320
Uh... Did you wake me up, sis?
I mean, what're you doing here?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.290
I'm gathering medicinal herbs.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.130
Herbs?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.330
Yes. For healing injuries,
sickness and the like.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.440
You got a lot to do early
in the morning, sis...

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.840
You, too.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.810
What've you been doing
in a place like this so early?

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.820
Training!

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.120
Could it be that…
you're a Ninja or something?

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.490
What with that headband and…

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.700
Is that what I look like? Is it?

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.830
Yup! I'm a Ninja!

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.600
No kidding.
You're great, aren't you.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.710
But…why are you training?

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.610
As for me,
I want to get stronger!

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.820
But, you already look
strong enough.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.020
No, no! I want to get
even stronger!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.820
What for?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.830
To become the best Ninja
in my village!

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.060
I'm going to get everyone
to recognize my strength!

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.030
And I have to prove something
to a certain person!

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.170
Is that for the sake of somebody?
Or is it for your own sake?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.810
Huh?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.010
What's so funny?!

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.820
Do you have somebody
precious in your life?

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.920
Precious…?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.790
What is it you want to say, sis?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.720
What is it?

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.000
When a person has something
precious they want to protect…

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.830
that's when they can truly
become strong.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.710
Your dad loves the town
you're from, so…

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.810
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.650
Get your hands off Iruka Sensei!

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.690
I'll kill you!!

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.820
Yeah! I know that well, too!

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.930
You'll get strong.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.830
Yeah!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.500
I hope we meet again somewhere.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.810
Oh…and…

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.540
I'm a man!

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.410
That can't be!
He's cuter than Sakura.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:00.810
Why? That's strange.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.910
This world is full of mystery…

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.820
Ouch.
Hey! What're you doing?!

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.990
Did you forget about mealtime,
you idiot?

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.130
Naruto?

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.400
What in the world is Naruto doing?

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.900
And Sasuke hasn't come back
from his walk either…

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.010
No way…
Naruto can climb that high now?

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.950
Wow!

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.520
How 'bout that, how 'bout that?!

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.460
As for me,
I can climb this high now!

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.990
Whoa!

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:52.830
Oh, you idiot!

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:53.830
This is bad!

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.900
Gotcha!

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.810
You fell for it, you fell for it!

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.910
Don't scare us like that!

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.480
I'll kill him later! Cha!

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.450
He's grown a little, eh.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.160
Oh! You idiot, Naruto!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.030
It's cuz you went overboard!

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.340
You fool.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.810
Sasuke…?

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.810
Nice, Sasuke.
You're awesome !

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.580
These kids are really growing.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.930
Naruto…

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.170
Uzumaki, eh.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.540
You've recovered considerably.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.110
All right…

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.820
Just a little more, Haku.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.020
Yes.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.000
Shall we go back?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.400
Okay!

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.280
They're late.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.810
And not just Naruto,
but even Sasuke too.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.690
What happened to you guys?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.820
You're really muddy
and really wiped out.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:02.830
We both…climbed up to the top.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.700
Good.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:10.830
Naruto, Sasuke, you'll also start guarding
Tazuna next time!

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.370
Got it! Whoa!

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:15.370
You idiot!

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.610
In just a teeny little bit,
the bridge will be complete.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.410
It's thanks to you guys.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.820
Even so, don't let your guard down…

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.290
I've really wanted to ask
 you for a long time now…

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.960
But why are you still here
even though I lied about the mission?

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:42.830
To see what is right without doing it
bespeaks an absence of courage.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.200
Like master, like man.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.210
It's a teaching of the late Hokage.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.340
The things I truly
hold dear to myself…

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.870
I'll protect until the very end
with both these arms.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.810
Don't cry…lnari.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.160
Why…?

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.630
What is it?

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.830
Why do you desperately work so hard
until you get like that?!

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.600
There's no way you'd be
a match for Gato's men even if you train!

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.610
No matter what cool things you say
or how much effort you make…

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.910
the weak always lose out…

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.810
against the truly strong!

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.590
Shut up. I'm not like you.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.830
Shut up!
Looking at you makes me sick!

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.960
Sticking your nose in even though
you know nothing of this land!

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.830
I'm not like you who's always
acting frivolous

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.230
not knowing one thing about pain!

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.670
So you're just gonna cry
all day like the lead in a tragedy?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.250
An idiot like you can just cry forever!
You crybaby!

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.120
Naruto! That's a bit harsh!

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:45.820
Naruto…

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.610
Got a minute?

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.860
Naruto didn't mean any harm
with what he said…

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.390
He's just uncouth, so…

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.100
We heard the story
about your father from Tazuna.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.810
Like you, Naruto never had
a father as a young child…

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.780
Actually he doesn't know either
of his parents.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.110
Not only that.
He didn't have a single friend.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:44.820
What?

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.820
However…

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.620
I've never seen him sulk,
be timid, or cry.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.390
He's always eager,
wanting to be acknowledged by someone.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.030
If it's for the sake of that "dream,"
he always risks his life.

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.810
He's probably tired of crying.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.620
So, he knows the true meaning
of the word strong.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.820
Like your father.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.090
Naruto might understand your feelings
the most.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.830
What Naruto said earlier…

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.800
There's no mistaking that
he's told himself that over and over again.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.080
Okay, then!
I leave Naruto in your hands.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.520
Because he's used his body
to the limit…

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.190
I don't think he'll be able
to move today.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.530
Mr. Kakashi, are you feeling all right?

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.000
Yes, somehow.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.900
We'll be going!

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.640
What're you doing?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.610
I didn't hire you guys for charity work…

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.510
Hey, are you listening, Zabuza?!
Hey!!

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.850
Shall we go…Haku?

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.120
Yes.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.810
I overslept!

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.880
Hey hey!! Where is everyone?

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.950
Naruto. Your Sensei wanted you
to rest and relax…today

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.280
I knew it.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.090
They left me behind.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:06.660
I'll be back.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.700
Darn it!
They could've woken me up!

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.310
W-What the heck is this?!

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.490
What is going on?
What's happened?

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.220
It couldn't be…

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.830
Inari! Give me a hand.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.360
Inari!?

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.830
I'll be right there.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.980
This mist…

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.150
Sasuke! Sakura!
They're coming!

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.530
I knew he was still alive.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.960
Making an appearance so soon, eh…

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.830
Say, Kakashi Sensei.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.930
This is his…Hidden Mist Jutsu, right?!

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.810
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Kakashi.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.610
I see you've got those brats
with you as always.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.420
He's still trembling. Poor thing.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.660
I'm trembling with…excitement.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.530
Do it, Sasuke.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.480
I can see it!

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.780
Well-well. So he could
see the Water Clones, eh.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.490
That brat's grown quite a bit.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.990
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:21.960
So it seems.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.670
Phew, that was a close shave.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.800
Sorry I was late.
But Inari, you were great.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.780
I was able to save your mom
thanks to your courage.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.240
Hey, wait a minute.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.310
Doesn't the fact that
we were attacked mean

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.810
that Kakashi Sensei and
the others are in danger too?!

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.420
Next episode:
 "Haku's Secret Jutsu: Crystal Ice Mirrors"

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.120
I'm going to kick butt once again!
