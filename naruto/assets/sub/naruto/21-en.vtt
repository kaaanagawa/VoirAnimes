WEBVTT

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.720
C'mon!

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.970
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.370
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780
For no single one,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.560
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.790
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.100
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.470
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.440
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.870
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.450
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.950
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.660
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.670
Rockin' my heart

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.590
You're an embarrassment
to our village.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.120
Why do you think we came all
the way here to Leaf Village?

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.230
P-Please listen to me, Gaara.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.900
T-They lashed out first…

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.100
Shut up!

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.430
I'll kill you.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
U-Understood, I was wrong.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.570
I-I'm sorry…
I'm really sorry.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.510
I'm sorry about that…

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.580
This guy…has a nasty look.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.550
To think he was able to hit
that Kankuro

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.590
with a tiny rock with great ease.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.290
This guy's…good.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.600
Let's go.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.470
We didn't come here
to play around.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.970
I know.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.570
Hold it!

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.870
What is it?

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.810
Judging from your headbands,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.580
you're Ninjas from the Village
Hidden in the Sand, right?

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.280
Without question, the Land of Fire and
the Land of Wind are allied nations.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.220
But the arbitrary coming and
going of Shinobi

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.020
is supposed to
be prohibited by the treaty.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.020
State your purpose!

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.590
Depending on circumstances…

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.990
Hmph! So this is what they mean

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.360
by the darkest place being
under the candlestick.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.060
Don't you know anything about it?

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.260
My permit!

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.570
As you say, we're Sand Village Genins
from the Land of Wind.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.240
We came to this village to
take the Chunin Exam.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.310
Chunin Exam…?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.580
Identify Yourself:
Powerful New Rivals

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.450
What is the Chunin Exam anyways?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.790
You really don't know
anything, do you?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.890
Bro, if you pass the exam,
you can become a Chunin from a Genin!

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.260
I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.100
Heh!

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.330
Hey! You there…

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.970
What's your name?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.870
Huh?  M-Me?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.910
No! The gourd next to you!

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.750
I'm Gaara of the desert…

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.450
I have an interest in you as well…

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080
What's your name?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.590
Sasuke Uchiha.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.430
Say! Say! What about me?
What about me?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.330
Not interested.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.640
Heh! Things have gotten interesting.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.510
Konohamaru, do I look weak?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.210
Compared to Sasuke, yes...

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.380
Sasuke, I won't lose to you!

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.850
What's gotten into you,
all of a sudden?!

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.550
What do you think?

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.590
I don't think they're anything special.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.590
But the black-haired one from Leaf Village
and the gourd from the Sand Village…

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.590
those two need to be checked.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.430
Now then, in conjunction
with beginning the Chunin Exam,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.640
let us first have those in charge
of the rookie Genin come forward.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.580
Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma…

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.480
So?  Are there any Genin from
your squads

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.080
you wish to recommend
for these exams?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.290
It goes without saying,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.590
but if it's a Genin who has carried out
eight or more formal missions,

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.960
you can recommend them
for the exams if you wish.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.430
Well, as a general rule,

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.570
having carried out more than twice
that amount of missions is appropriate.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.370
There's no need to hear this…

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.570
It's too soon for them.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.140
Then, you first Kakashi.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.910
The Kakashi-led Group Seven...

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.150
Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.
Sakura Haruno.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.790
I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend these
three for the Chunin Exam.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.260
Huh?

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.930
The Kurenai-led Group Eight...

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.400
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka,
Shino Aburame.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.570
These three, I, Kurenai Yuhi,
recommend the same.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.570
The Asuma-led Group Ten...

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.580
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,
Choji Akimichi.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.280
These three, I, Asuma Sarutobi,
recommend the same.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.580
All three recommended…

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.590
To think rookies will be
in the Chunin Exam…

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.590
Hasn't it been five years
since that's happened?

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.720
Hmm…

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.220
Wait a minute!

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.860
What is it, Iruka?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.590
Lord Hokage, please let me
say one thing.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.600
This may be presumptuous,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.900
but as for the nine names
that were given,

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.170
I was in charge of them at the Academy.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.570
Admittedly, they were all students
with ability,

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:34.940
but it's too soon…!

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.810
They should be tested after
having gained more experience!

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.380
I became a Chunin when I was
six years younger than Naruto is now.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.580
Naruto is different from you!

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.090
Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.060
They always do nothing but complain
about important missions…

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.060
Teaching them a lesson
once would be fun.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.600
Trying to crush them
would be interesting, too.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.600
W-What did you say?!

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.570
Well, joking aside…

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.570
Iruka Sensei...

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.040
I understand what you want to say.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.740
It's aggravating, I know.
However…

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.010
Kakashi...

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.510
Don't do it.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.420
Stay out of this!
They're not your students anymore!

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.420
Now they're my subordinates!

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.560
Man…troublesome people.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.330
B-But the Chunin Exam
is also known as…

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.270
Iruka…

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.940
I understand your point.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.140
Master Hokage...

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.410
Therefore, I have decided to conduct

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.280
a special preliminary exam
for these rookie Genins.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.080
P-Preliminary exam…?!

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.290
Say! Say! Say!

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.530
Why is it that he's the one who
always calls us out,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.930
and then makes us wait?!

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.430
That's right! That's right!

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.670
What's he going to do about
the feelings of a maiden

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.570
who accidentally overslept and resigned
herself to no blow-drying?!

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.510
I overslept, so I haven't washed my face
and didn't brush my teeth.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.680
Y-You…That's dirty.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.920
Why're these guys so hyper
first thing in the morning?!

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.190
Hey, good morning, folks!

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.590
Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life…

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.230
Right! That's a lie!!

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.100
Uh, well…

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.600
This is sudden, but I recommended
you guys for the Chunin Exam, so…

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.570
Here, these are your applications.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.500
Chunin Exam…

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.740
That being said, the recommendations
are not compulsory.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.580
You guys are free to decide whether
you take the Exam or not.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.580
All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.350
Hey, cut it out. Get away already…

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.350
Only those who want to take the Exam,
sign that application and

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.590
come to Room 301 of the Academy
at 3:00 p.m. five days from now…

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.730
That's it!

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.530
Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.570
Chunin Exams, eh…

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.310
I bet lots of strong guys would be there…

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.840
For example, that guy!

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.210
And this guy!

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.920
Okaaay! I won't lose to
anybody no matter what!

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.330
If I take the first place, the path to
the Hokage is right there!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.600
Sure enough, it's decided that Naruto
will be the Hokage…

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.340
I'll just retire my elderly self at once.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:52.440
Yaaaay!

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.580
I might be able to fight him.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.450
I...don't want to…

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.550
Here I can't…

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.060
keep up with Sasuke,
and not even with Naruto…

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.660
The Chunin Exam, no way…

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.590
Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.860
Sure. I don't have any missions today,
so I'll play with you guys!

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.590
Yaaay!

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.260
Oh!

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.700
Leader! Konohamaru!

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.140
What're you going to do with Moegi?!

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.240
Hey, you! Let Moegi go!

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.010
Darn!
Let's follow them, Konohamaru!

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.480
Y-Yeah!

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.680
W-Wait!

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.030
Chunin Exams, eh…

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.730
Yo.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.700
S-Sasuke, what's up?

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.270
How about we go for a little walk?

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.210
No way! For real?!

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.350
Well well... So you can keep up
at this speed, eh?

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.580
Wait for me! Moegi!

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.590
Bro, where'd you go?

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.690
I think we are lost.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.630
Nooo! Let me go!

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.460
Even the strongly fortified
Village Hidden in the Leaf…

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.530
is mine if I slip in the
middle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:04.600
Hmm?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.570
That was fast…

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.140
Hey! You fat old man!

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.240
What're you going to do with Moegi?

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.380
What am I going to do, you ask?

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.080
You want to know?

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.150
Wha--?!

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.280
Don't move!

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.050
If you do,
the brat's dead meat!

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.090
Y-You. Why're you doing this?!

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.420
I want the first Hokage's
Scroll of Sealing!

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.590
If you bring it to me,
I'll return the brat!

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.230
Scroll of Sealing…

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.430
Umm…

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.400
Sasuke…

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.270
What's up, all of a sudden?

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.140
Sakura…

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.580
Give up on the Chunin Exam…
lt's too early for you.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880
Is it…?

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.710
I thought so…

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.350
The Chunin Exam is
a gathering of top dogs…

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:54.590
You might die if you're not careful…

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:56.620
Sasuke…

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.220
So you're worried about me, right?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.360
Yeah…kind of…

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.030
What a display of affection, eh?

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.300
Get lost! If you don't want to die.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.430
Don't talk as if you know everything!

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.300
Don't make me angry!

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.200
Sasuke!

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.540
Don't take me lightly!

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.580
Sasuke!

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.600
Sasuke?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.600
Sasuke!

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.500
Sasuke!!

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.570
What're you doing?

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.510
Hurry up and bring me
the Scroll of Sealing!

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.910
What'll happen…if I say, heck no?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.710
You don't care what happens
to this brat?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.220
Heh, I'm fine with whatever happens
to that bunch of straw, I say.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.590
Wha--?!
When did he do that?!

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.620
I've taken Moegi back from you,
thank you!

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.590
As expected great leader!
Moegi respects you.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.660
Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh…?

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.170
You don't know when to give up!

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.370
Naruto!

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.970
Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.680
Konohamaru, I was scared.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.180
Oh, there-there…

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.650
Leader, did you catch him?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.590
Yup, as you can see!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.850
Huh?  What?!

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.560
Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.590
Dang it! When did he switch?!

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.490
I see…

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.600
If you don't want to turn out
like this,

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.500
you'll give up on
the Chunin Exam, too.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.540
Sasuke, don't die…!

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.580
Big mistake if you think
I'd say that.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.280
I was aware of this Genjutsu
right from the start!

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.350
What?!

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.720
The real Sasuke wouldn't do
something like

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.050
invite me to go for a walk!

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.220
Don't make me say
such frustrating things!

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.460
That kind of elementary Genjutsu
won't work on me!

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.590
Did you say elementary…?

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:16.760
That's right!

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.600
Incidentally, I've seen through that
you're also an illusion

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.100
and aren't really here!

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.000
I don't know about…

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.700
that!

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680
See?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.580
Just what I'd expect of
Kakashi's subordinate.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.780
However, this will become reality
in the Chunin Exam!

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.590
I wonder if you can endure that…?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.920
I'm not scared!
I'll take them on anytime!

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.430
The Chunin Exam isn't...
The Chunin Exam isn't…!

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.800
I'm still not sure if I can do it…

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.570
That was a stupid thing to do…

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.080
How was it?

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.720
We went to the trouble of having
a special preliminary exam,

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.490
but all nine of the rookies passed.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.600
As you say, it appears their skills
have definitely improved.

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:31.570
Well, the actual Chunin Exam
won't just end at this, but...

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.870
Hey, have you heard?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.670
Rookies are going to be
in the Chunin Exam

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.810
for the first time in five years.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.580
No way.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.880
It's probably just a Jonin battle of wills
or something anyway.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.580
No…

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.450
The story is that three among them
are that Kakashi's unit.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.590
That's interesting…

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.790
Well, be that as it may…

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.960
That's a sad story…

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.570
Sakura, you're late!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.340
Yeah…sorry…

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.180
Morning, Sasuke.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.450
Yeah…

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.350
Something's strange about Sakura.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.590
So, are you sure you're going
to attempt taking

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.260
the Chunin Exam with that skill?

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.970
May it'd be best if you runts quit.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.570
You're green-assed brats, after all.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.240
Please let us through.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.240
That's…mean…

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.750
What did you say?!

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.580
Listen!
We're being nice to you!

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.720
The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.620
Many times have we seen
people quit Shinobi

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.930
as well as people who were
disabled for life

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.490
just because they took this Exam.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.600
Also, a Chunin is at the level
of a unit leader.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.770
Mission failures,
death of subordinates,

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.170
it's all part of the
responsibilities of a leader!

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.310
A brat such as this a Chunin?

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:20.740
What's so bad about weeding out
those who won't pass anyway?!

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.780
A just argument.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.580
However, you will let me through.

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.250
And could you also immediately
undo this barrier created with Genjutsu?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.790
I have business on the third floor.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.960
What's this guy talking about…?

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.490
I don't know…

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.700
– Well, well…
– So you noticed, eh?

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.600
How about it, Sakura?

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.140
You should've been
the first one to realize it.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.870
Huh…?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.570
Your analytical strength and
Genjutsu know-how

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.640
has improved the most in our squad, so...

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.540
Sasuke…

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.180
Thank you…

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.680
Of course. I realized it ages ago!

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.850
You see, this is the second floor!

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.850
Yup!

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.530
Well, not bad…
But all you've done is to catch on.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.260
Right?!

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.840
H-He's fast!

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.410
This person…

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.250
He's a different person from
when he was getting punched before!

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.580
He stopped my kick…

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.680
What's with that Chakra in his arm?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.790
Hey, this isn't what you promised.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.590
You were the one who said

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.360
you didn't want to carelessly
attract attention and be watched.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.560
But…

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.960
Oh boy… 					This again…

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.970
This guy…

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:51.940
The marks where he was hit
are disappearing.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.570
Was he faking?

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.410
My name's Rock Lee.
Your name's Sakura, right…?

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:02.080
Huh?

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:07.520
Please go out with me!
I'll protect you until I die!

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.590
Absolutely…not.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.760
Huh?

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.990
You're... too intense.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.500
Hey, you there.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:22.800
Identify yourself.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.540
Dang it! Again?

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.170
It's always about Sasuke!

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.810
When asking someone his name,
give your own name first.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.580
You're... a rookie, right?
How old are you?

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.180
I'm not obliged to answer.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.580
What…?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.220
Cute.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.490
Too intense, huh…

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.600
Uninterested, huh…

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.970
Now then!
Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.940
So those are Kakashi and
Guy's treasured brats.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.010
Well, for the time being,
their applications will pass.

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.340
Yeah…

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.150
It appears this year's test-takers
will be amusing…

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.580
For us proctors too, eh.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.590
Good grief…

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.760
This Chunin Exam…
is full of monsters.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashes
and bushy eyebrows.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:12.440
Oh! It's you!

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.870
You're the overly intense guy
who just got rejected by Sakura.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.140
What's with your bizarre
green jumpsuit?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.610
What? You want to challenge me,
bushy-browed bumpkin?

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.580
I'll teach you that it's a million years
too soon to be doing that.

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:29.590
Next episode:
 "Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!"

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.390
As for me,
I'm going to kick butt once again!
