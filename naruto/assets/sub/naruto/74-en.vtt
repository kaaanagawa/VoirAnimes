WEBVTT

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.640
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.890
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.180
One more time

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
Are you really happy

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.430
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.430
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:54.680
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.840
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.840
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.890
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.840
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.840
One more time

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.300
Uh oh!

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.220
Pakkun?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.890
Sakura?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.350
Why did you stop
all of a sudden?!

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.800
The scents of Sasuke and the other two…
are quickly moving away!

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140
It smells like Sasuke is
chasing those two people…

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.840
What?!

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.840
Sasuke is?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.260
There are no other signs
of movement.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.840
But…

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.430
Let’s not just stand around.
Let’s go after Sasuke right away!

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.680
But…what?

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.840
The people who are left are going
to fight each other.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.760
We’ll end up taking a little longer way…

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.760
but all there is for us to do
is to avoid it.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.510
Why?! If we do that, it’ll only delay our
catching up to Sasuke.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840
Let’s just speed on through!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.760
What are you saying, Naruto?!

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.640
We don’t know what’ll happen
in the battle zone!

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.840
Even if we don't desire it,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.470
there’s a possibility that
we’ll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.800
That doesn’t have anything
to do with it!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.640
Kid! Our mission is to bring
Sasuke back.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.840
So the cardinal rule is to avoid battle
as much as possible until then!

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.430
– Let’s go! 					– Got it!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.010
Fine!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.470
Puppet Master Jutsu!

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.840
I’m from the Aburame Clan
of the Leaf Village…

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.430
When we fight,
we never underestimate our opponent,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.840
no matter what puny insects
they may be.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.050
I’ll advance with full force!

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.640
Bring it!

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.050
Put me down, Temari.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.100
Can you move, Gaara?

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.840
Gaara!

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.140
Kankuro is delaying Uchiha now.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.930
We must use this opening…

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.640
If we don’t get a move on,
the operation will…

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.600
Huh?!

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.840
Temari, go over there.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.550
What?

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.840
Just beat it! You’re in the way!

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.180
Astonishing Truth!
Gaara’s Identity Emerges!

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.720
Poison on the blade!

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.890
I won’t let you get away!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.840
That’s… Sasuke Uchiha!
Did he get past Kankuro?!

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.800
No… No matter how you look at it,
it’s too soon.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.550
Did another assailant come?

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.180
I don’t know what you Sand Ninja
are scheming…

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.100
but I’ll stop you!

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.220
And…

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.260
I’ll ascertain your true identity!

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.600
Gaara!

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.470
Don’t tell me…!

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.640
Is he going to rouse that thing
in a place like this?!

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.840
This is no joke…
lt’s out of my hands.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.220
Stop, Gaara!
Have you forgotten the operation?!

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.470
You who are strong…
You who are called Uchiha…

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.680
You who have friends…

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.930
You who have a purpose…

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.300
You who are like…me!

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.840
By killing you…

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.890
I will exist in this world as
the one who destroyed all of that…

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.390
I can truly experience “life.”

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.100
What is it?

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.850
It’s so obvious if you release
such a blood-thirsty aura…

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.840
Come on out.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.350
So it’s you, eh…

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.840
What’s your purpose?
Why do you seek power?

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.140
It ‘s none of your business.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.840
Beat it!
You’re a hindrance to my training.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.470
You…

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.300
have the same eyes as I do.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.640
Eyes that seek power,
brimming with hate and murderous intent.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.140
You’re like me.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.720
Don’t forget… You’re my…

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.510
You’re…

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.430
my…

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.600
You're…my…

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.760
my prey!

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:52.840
It’s started…!

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.840
A Substitution?!

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.550
You’re naive.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.050
All right!

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.840
Insects?!

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.390
To think you’d make
a clone out of insects and

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.100
wrap around behind me…

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.350
Not bad!

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.430
Your reach encompasses from medium
to long distance and you use a puppet.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.800
I didn't think you would
do well in close combat.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.840
With that Puppet Master Jutsu
where you have to concentrate

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.840
on the control of the puppet…

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.470
the one casting the Jutsu is
prone to openings in defense.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.390
You’re very aware of the weakness
of a puppet master!

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.010
However, from here on,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.640
I’ll show you the essence of
this Ninjutsu fighting style!

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.640
The real terror of Crow…
my puppet of warfare!

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.840
This is Poison Smoke Bomb!

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.350
Did I inhale…a little bit?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.390
I get it…
And the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh?

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.100
Listen, everyone…

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.470
Even if enemy Shinobi appear,
don’t panic.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.350
Go into the hidden room quickly.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.840
Your Jonin and Chunin Senseis
will protect you all with their lives!

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.930
Oh!

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.890
Konohamaru…

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.890
It’ll be okay!

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.300
Everyone’s doing their best.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.140
They can drive away
the enemies right away.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.430
Cracks in the face rock
of the Hokage Lords…

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:06.840
How ominous…

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.970
Grandpa…

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.840
To have come this far…
To have come this far…!

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:39.890
Do I already lack the power
to drag out his soul?

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.390
With this feeble body…

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.600
even though I’m prepared to die,
is it not enough…?!

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:52.840
You probably could’ve killed me
if you’d been ten years younger.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.840
Sarutobi! If you don’t kill him now,
the village is doomed!

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.800
Do you understand?!

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.890
I…understand!

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.640
Useless…old man…

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.050
Now…Let me feel it!

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:57.840
That eye!

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.510
That eye…from before!

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.470
This doesn’t look like it’ll end
by the time you come for back-up…

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.140
Shino…

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.350
It looks like the poison has
slowly started to circulate.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.850
I’ll finish this!

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.550
Insects, again?!

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.890
But he shouldn’t be able to
move so much in that state…

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.800
I’ll make things easier for you…

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.840
Hey! What’s wrong?!

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:41.220
What’s happening…?

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.840
Don’t tell me…!

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.800
It’s futile…
He can’t move anymore…

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.970
I had the beetles burrow
into every joint…

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.350
He stuffed beetles into its joints
so that the puppet can’t move?

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.720
That was his aim from the beginning!

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.350
The beetles are passing through
the threads of my Chakra…

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:07.850
Why…?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.840
That’s it!
As I recall, their food is Chakra.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.390
At this rate,
my location will be found out!

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.010
He cut the Chakra threads himself…?

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.680
You got careless!

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.890
Instantly reattaching the Chakra threads
that have once been cut

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.430
is simple for a first-rate puppet master.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.550
And…

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.840
Crow is a puppet…

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.850
that has a weapon in each
and every component of the body!

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.970
It’s a big mistake if you think
this has ended…

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.260
by your stopping my movements!

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.760
There’s lots of poison
on the tip of the needle…

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.470
Die!

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.510
What?!

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.430
Just like that, the insects…!

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.510
The Chakra threads have been
bitten through!

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.840
What?! Why…?!

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.970
Where did these insects
spring out from?!

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.840
By beating away the bait insects
along the Chakra threads,

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.050
you dropped your guard.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.470
You didn’t notice…
the wriggling insects behind you.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.470
The insects were moving
the whole time…

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.050
heading for your headband.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.260
W-What did you say?!

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.220
The one blow earlier…

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.840
I pretended to miss and
stuck one of those beetles on you.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:33.840
But how did you know where I was
with one such beetle…?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.840
I…hate explaining the same thing twice.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.890
Shino? 					Why are you here?!

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.760
I put a female beetle on you
before you left the arena!

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.430
The females have almost no smell…

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:03.680
Only a male can sniff out
the subtle smell of the female.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.550
Then, this one beetle on my forehead…

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.720
Right… It’s a female.

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.930
The poison has circulated
through my whole body, huh…

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.180
It looks like I won’t be able
to go to back you up…

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.510
I’m sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.430
Is he a…monster?

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:50.760
Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.800
Of my existence?!

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.350
Come out… 					Sasuke Uchiha!

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.760
You’re…my…

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.640
prey!

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:27.970
Everyone makes mistakes
lt’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:39.300
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.970
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:55.010 --> 00:22:00.010
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:05.430
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.680
Let’s go carve the badges in our chest
Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.840
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:31.640
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:42.180
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.840
Forge on strong

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.840
What a speed and strength!

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.840
If I didn’t use my Sharingan
to foresee his movement,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.470
I would have been in pieces!

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.600
But a merely defensive battle
will do no good.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.100
What do I do?

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.180
How should I stop him?
Do I need to use that…?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.930
But Chidori may not…

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:23.970
Next time: “Sasuke’s Decision:
Pushed to the Edge!”
