WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.220
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.120
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.000
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.170
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.210
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.420
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.750
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.560
We now start the second test
of the Chunin Exam!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
Look for the brats!

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.360
Those three, right?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.300
All right! Let’s go!

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.350
Okay! First we search for that thing.
Can you do it, Hinata?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.420
Yes.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.420
Slow down, Lee! We just started.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.190
I know. But…

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.990
I can’t stay still!

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.600
Who knows what kind of
powerful foe is waiting for us?!

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.270
As you already understand,
we have only one target!

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.440
It sounds like they’ve already started.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.910
Huh? That was someone’s
scream just now, right?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.950
I-I’m kinda getting nervous.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.560
I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.560
I-I have to pee.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600
Y-You… Fool!

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.740
What are you doing in front of a lady!

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.340
Go to the grass!

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.240
Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.150
Oh…! Ohhh...!

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.230
Aaah… that was a lot!

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.030
Feels much better!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.070
C’mon Naruto! I told you not to say
things like that in front of a lady--!

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.740
What?!

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.940
S-Sasuke…

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.540
no matter what,
you don’t have to go that far.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.250
W-What was that for?

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.420
Where’s the real Naruto?!

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.380
Huh?

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.890
I don't know what the heck
you’re talking about!

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.730
What happened to the scratch
you got earlier from the Proctor?!

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.100
And…your Shuriken holster
is on your left leg.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.370
That guy’s right-handed.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.010
You’re worse at transformation
than Naruto, you phony!

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.710
Unlucky me! In that case...

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.550
Which one of you got  the scroll?!

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.720
Since things have come to this,
I’ll resort to force!

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.550
Fire Style:
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.000
Heeeey! Sasuke!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.100
You’ve got to be kidding, loser.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:48.570
All right!

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.940
I caught you off guard! Lucky!

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.140
Paper Bomb…!

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.610
This is lucky!

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.320
I’ll kill you if you move!
Calmly hand over the scroll!

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.250
Sasuke!

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.590
I won’t let you get away!

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.700
Y-You’re always late Naruto!

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.070
Absorption with my Chakra.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.880
Sasuke…

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.850
Don’t just stand there, Sakura!

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.720
No guarantee this guy's alone!

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.590
Got it?!

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.630
If you let your guard down
you’ll really get killed…

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.660
It’s unlucky! I came on my own
to conceal my presence,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.370
but that became my enemy…

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.540
He got away, huh…?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.550
If there’s an instance that
we become separated,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.250
don’t trust him if he looks
like your teammate.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.550
Just like now there’s a possibility

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.220
that an enemy will transform
to get close to us!

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.960
– Yeah. 					– So what do we do?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.560
We’ll decide on a password.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.930
Password?

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.100
Listen, if the password is incorrect,
no matter what he looks like…

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.410
presume he is an enemy!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.340
I’ll only say it once, so listen closely.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.450
You ask,
 Ninja song, “Ninja Chance.”

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.550
And the answer is this:

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.320
“The chance to sneak up when a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.260
“The quiet place has no secret hideout.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.860
“It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.960
“The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard.”

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.260
That’s it.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:00.800
Okay!

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.900
Could you say it again?

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.170
Huh?!

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.170
I told you I’d only say it once.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.440
Could it be that you couldn’t memorize it?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.540
– You fool! 					– Huh?!

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.510
I got it right away!

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.650
I-I memorized it perfectly!

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.390
I thought just in case,
I’d listen one more time…

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.320
I’ll carry the scroll!

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.730
Hey, wait Sasuke.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.860
Ouch!

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.600
What is it?

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.140
A new enemy?!

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.490
You guys go play around …

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.590
I’ll go alone…

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.540
Sakura!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.810
Sasuke!

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.070
Don’t come closer!

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.810
First the password…

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.810
Ninja song, “Ninja Chance”!

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.480
Ah! Umm…

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.180
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.750
The quiet place has no secret hideout.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.420
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.720
The time when an enemy is tired
and drops his guard.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560
Good.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.560
Owwww!

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.630
Hey everyone, are you okay?

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.300
Naruto, wait!

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.570
The password…

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.730
I know…

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.670
The chance to sneak up where a large
number of enemies are making a scene.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.540
The quiet place has no
secret hideout.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.110
It is important for a Shinobi
to know the right time.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.610
The time when an enemy
is tired and drops his guard.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.750
– What?! 					– Huh?!

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.750
What are you doing?!

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.190
This time it’s someone who
can dodge my attack, huh?

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.560
What are you saying, Sasuke?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.560
Naruto just said
the password properly.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.570
He was able to say it,
 that’s the problem!

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.500
– Huh?! 					– Wha--?

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.540
Do you really think that guy can
remember a password that long?

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.570
Oh!

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.010
If we asked the normal Naruto
what the password is,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.550
what do you think he’d say?

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.550
“Sorry. I’ve forgotten it.”

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.050
Besides, his movements when
he avoided my attack…

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.060
It was clearly different
from Naruto’s!

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:44.860
Show your true self already,
fake one!

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.770
That’s how it is, huh…

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.550
But if you knew he would forget it,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.190
why didn’t you make
the password shorter?

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.520
I knew that you were
underground

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.560
eavesdropping on
our conversation.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.100
So I chose that password on purpose.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.070
Oh really. So you’re not tired
or letting your guard down.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.110
This will be more fun than I thought.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.350
This person’s…too creepy!

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.180
And where’s Naruto?

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.260
Huh?

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.320
Owww!

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.560
And heave!

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.930
Huh? Where are Sakura
and that Sasuke?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.440
H-Huge!

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.510
This is the first time I’ve seen…
a snake this huge!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.960
Behind?!

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.560
T-Tail!

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.050
You want our Earth Scroll,
don’t you?

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.820
‘Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.730
Well, let’s begin…

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.540
the battle for the Scrolls.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.710
Life or Death!

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.010
Genjutsu?!

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.180
No, that's not it.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.450
This is simply
a thirst for blood.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.560
What’s going on?

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.430
Just looking at her eyes
made me think of death.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.000
Who is this…woman?!

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.570
Sa…kura…?

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.020
It’s no good.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.090
We have no choice but to flee here.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.960
Unless we do, the only thing
waiting for us is…

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.000
Death!

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.870
Let me out! Hey!

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.570
Spit... me... out!

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:52.180
Darn!
lt’s not going to work.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.010
Something else...

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:56.380
Oh!

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.820
The rice ball I took for lunch!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.390
Huh?!

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400
It’s dissolving!

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.370
I’ll be digested just like
that rice ball eventually…

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.270
N-No!

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.980
Let me out! Let me... out!

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.920
Can’t move already...?

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.250
She’s going to kill me!

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.720
Move…move…move…!

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.890
Move!

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.300
Move! Move!

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.070
Move!

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.950
Even if it’s just a little…
Move!

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.490
What do you intend to do... with that?

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.420
I can’t move!

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.560
Don’t worry.
I’ll end this in a second.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.130
You won’t even have
the time to feel pain.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.750
I wanted you to entertain me more.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.550
It’s too bad.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.570
Am… I going to die here?

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.540
Iruka Sensei

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.550
Old Man Hokage…

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.390
Konohamaru...

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.560
Kakashi Sensei.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.230
Sakura.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.070
Sasuke.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.480
A lot happened between him and me.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.550
Even though we always squabbled,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.650
we cooperated and saved Kakashi Sensei
in that encounter with Zabuza.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.820
During our Chakra training in forest,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.460
we competed each other and
practiced climbing up trees.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.070
That’s it! I haven’t…

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.570
settled things with him yet!

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.940
– More rice! 					– More rice!

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.050
If this creature doesn’t want to
spit me out …

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.980
I’ll make it to do so at any cost!

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.170
I see.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.060
Sasuke!

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.100
He wounded himself
at the last moment…

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.070
Move. Move. Move. 					Move...!

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.340
Move!

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.620
He wiped out the fear with pain.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.930
As expected,
he’s not the average prey.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.530
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.710
I...am a Shinobi who
will become Hokage!

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.150
I won’t put up with being
snake dung in this place!

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.360
Sasuke.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.800
Are you okay?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.540
If we don’t flee in a hurry,
we’ll be discovered here, too.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.810
How do we flee…?

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.440
How should we escape…?

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.650
I’ve never seen Sasuke…

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.310
so worked up.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.860
Sasuke, a snake!

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:48.100
Shoot! I was too shaken up
to notice the snake!

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.510
Don’t come near me!

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.110
Don’t lower your guard,
not even for a moment…

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:37.850
A prey must always stay tense
and try to flee desperately...

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.850
before a predator.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.400
Ahh... Huh?!

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.510
Sorry Sasuke..

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.550
Naruto!

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:18.020
The password… I forgot it!

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.130
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:35.410
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:44.880
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:53.260
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.200
Or else I’ll cry

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.070
You won't have to search around you

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.600
It’s all ok now.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:16.550
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.020
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:26.560
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.390
Just sing.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.630
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.970
The two are one

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:44.440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:49.950
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.550
Hey, hey , hey!

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.420
It looks like you bullied
weaklings while I was gone.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360
That explosion and
that huge snake,

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.060
it's all your fault, isn't it?

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.400
You darn snake bastard!

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:13.540
Now that I, Naruto Uzumaki, is here,
I'll wipe the floor with you!

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.540
Next episode: "Naruto's Counterattack:
Never Give In!"

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.810
Look forward to my kicking butt!
