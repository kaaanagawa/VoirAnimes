WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.220
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.160
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.230
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.030
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.100
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.240
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.080
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.520
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.520
It will come, closer

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.530
Now

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.970
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.440
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.680
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.380
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.790
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.290
I’m going to be Hokage!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.730
I won’t lose here!

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.130
Whatever! You can’t keep up
with my speed at all!

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.100
U-!

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.610
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.380
Naruto Barrage!

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.070
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.140
I’m…getting stronger!

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.280
Ohhhh!

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.680
Cha!

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.720
Nice one! You did it!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.290
T-That Naruto beat Kiba!

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.620
It’s a major upset…

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.520
Yup!

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.530
Yes!

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.570
Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.510
This medicine works really well!

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.680
Here! Do you want to
use it too, Sakura?

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.480
Only your wounds heal
with such speed…Naruto.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.860
The power of Nine Tail never
cease to amaze me.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.500
U-Umm...

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.850
T-This is…

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.850
ointment for your wound,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.520
for you Kiba and Akamaru.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.790
Rather than worrying about others,

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.860
it’s about time you worried
about yourself!

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.530
Kiba…

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760
There are only 6 people left…

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.970
you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,
and the Sand guy.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.140
Listen, Hinata…

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.340
If you pull that guy from Sand,
withdraw quickly.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.650
And there’s one more…

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.180
Do the same if you get Neji, too.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.950
Withdraw quickly…

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.890
That guy will be hard on you.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.290
He will destroy you.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.090
Well, let’s announce the next match.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.360
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.260
– What? 					– Huh?

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.970
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.410
Hinata…

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.710
This is going to be an interesting match…

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.630
I never thought that I would
have a fight with you…

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.230
Lady Hinata.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.800
Brother Neji…

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.370
Brother?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.440
Huh?!

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.770
Those two are siblings?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.510
They’re descended from

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.580
one of the most honorable
old families in the Hidden Leaf…

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.150
The Hyuga Clan.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.160
But, they’re not siblings.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.590
Then, how are they related?

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.530
Well, the relation of a head family
and branch family…

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.530
That may be an appropriate
way to say it.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.940
Head family and branch family?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.200
Yes!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.410
Hinata is from the head family.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.640
In other words, a person from
the main household

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.080
and Neji is from a branch family
that is descended from that family.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.520
In other words,
it’s a fight between relatives.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.190
It must be uneasy for both of them…

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.120
Yes.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:16.490
However…

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.320
Huh? What is it?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.560
I’ve heard that from long ago,

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.690
there’ve been various incidents between
the head family and branch family,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.660
and now their relationship
isn’t on very good terms.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.530
Hmmm.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.600
Why?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.530
I don’t know the details either.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.500
Only…

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.570
The so-called distinguished Ninja clans
like Uchiha and Hyuga

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.010
have special techniques and
abilities that run in the family.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.510
It seems that the Hyuga household
laid down rules

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.680
for communicating those techniques…

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.190
It seems that there are many rules
that favor the head family…

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.520
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.660
And there have been
various incidents

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.730
between the head family and
branch family due to those rules.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.830
So this is a confrontation billed
as a clash of fate…

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.640
Oh, it’s gonna begin.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.350
Start the battle please!

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.880
Just one thing before we square off
against each other in the fight…

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.020
I should advise you, Lady Hinata.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.190
Withdraw!

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.920
You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.100
You’re too nice.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.530
You wish for harmony and
avoid conflict,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.640
you’re open to going with
the thinking of others.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.470
And, you have no confidence
in yourself.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.310
You’re always feeling inferior…

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.510
You thought it’s a good idea
to stay Genin.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.820
However, you can’t register for
the Chunin test without three members…

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.620
So you couldn’t turn down when Kiba
and the other proposed it and,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.060
the truth is, you entered
the exam reluctantly.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.660
Is that wrong?!

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.460
T-That’s wrong…

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.660
That’s not true…

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.200
I…

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.070
I only…

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.040
I wanted to change that about myself…

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.940
So I proposed it myself…

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:20.980
Hinata…

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.320
Stand up, Hanabi!

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.630
From now on, I’ll keep Hinata
under my wing…

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.800
But is that really okay?

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.440
Hinata should be the heir to
the Hyuga clan…

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.510
But, there is always death involved
with the job of Genin.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.510
Do what you want.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.520
She’s a failure who’s inferior even to her
younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.720
We don’t need her here
in Hyuga clan…

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.430
Is that all you have to say?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.530
If so, leave!

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:17.970
You’re in the way!

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.500
Yes.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.950
Hinata is trying to change
herself in her own way.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.600
Lady Hinata…

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.070
You are a spoiled one of
the head family.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.040
People can never change!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.980
A failure will always be a failure…

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.510
That personality and strength
won’t change.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.550
That guy…

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.830
Since people don’t change,
differences exist among them…

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.530
and expressions like “elite”
and “failure” are born.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.230
Everyone judges and are judged

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.500
based on the value of their face and
brain, ability and body type,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.910
good and bad points of
their personalities.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.180
People have to suffer and live

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.280
within the means of the
elements they cannot change.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.520
Just like the fact that I’m from a
branch family

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.950
and you’re from the head family,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.520
these things can’t change.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.530
I’ve seen everything with
this Byakugan.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.460
That’s why I understand!

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.530
You’re just talking tough.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:58.440
You’re really thinking that you’d
like to run away from this place…

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.670
T-That’s wrong…

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.370
I really…

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.570
Byakugan?

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.940
It’s said that if you trace
the Uchiha Clan’s history,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.780
the clan’s ability has its source
in Hyuga clan.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.620
The Byakugan is one of the
Hyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.120
a Visual Jutsu similar
to Sharingan…

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.990
However, with the ability of insight alone…

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.360
it gets the better of Sharingan.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.110
Byakugan!

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.310
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.930
My eyes can’t be deceived.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.730
Just now from my pressure,

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.510
your line of sight was pushed
to the upper left.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.240
This is the sign that you're recalling
your past experience…

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.410
your bitter past.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.950
And soon after that, your line of sight
moved to the bottom right…

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:58.920
This is the sign that you're imagining
physical and mental suffering.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.520
That means…

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.390
you’re picturing your old self,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.260
and from all of your experiences
up until now,

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.560
you’re imagining the result
of this battle…

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.270
The image of you losing!

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.980
Even the act of propping your arms
in front of your body…

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.820
It’s a gesture that means

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.990
you want to build a wall
between us and keep distant.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.920
And that reflects your mind...

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.030
that you don’t want any more
of your deepest feelings to be raided…

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.930
Because everything I’ve said
is right on the mark, right?

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:42.600
Furthermore…

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.640
Laying a finger on your lips,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.140
that too, is a self-familiarizing act
which represents a sense of panic.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.810
It represents a defense instinct--

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.320
you want to alleviate the tension
and unease.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.550
In other words…

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.360
deep in your heart,
you know it’s true, don’t you?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.530
Changing yourself,
is something you absolutely can’t--!

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.530
Sure, she can!

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.140
You don’t have the privilege of
deciding what a person is like, stupid!

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.510
Give it to him, Hinata!

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:30.610
Naruto…

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:40.520
Hinata!

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.060
Don’t just take it!
Argue back!

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.330
I’m getting irritated watching this!

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.510
Naruto…

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:05.820
What an annoying guy!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.660
Naruto…

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.530
Thank you!

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.930
The expression of her eyes
has changed…

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.900
So you’re not going to withdraw?

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.770
I ‘m not taking responsibility
for what happens!

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:30.840
I…

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.850
I won’t run away!

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.510
I don’t…

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.520
I don’t change my words…

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.520
That’s my Way of Ninja!

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.050
...want to run anymore!

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.620
Byakugan!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600
Brother Neji!

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.640
I challenge you!

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.510
T-That is…

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.380
Fine…

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.530
Of course, the same Hyuga style…

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.260
Her pose is very similar
to Neji’s.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.660
Hyuga style?

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.530
The strongest Taijutsu style
in the Village Hidden in the Leaf…

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.200
Huh?

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.300
I said it before...

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.440
The man who is most likely

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.540
the strongest Genin of Hidden
Leaf Village is on my team…

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.080
That’s…

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.410
That guy, Neji Hyuga.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.230
Here!

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.500
Did it go in?!

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.610
No…it was shallow!

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.740
No. Even a graze works.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.310
That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.580
is called the Hidden Leaf’s
distinguished family.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.720
Huh? What do you mean?

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.620
The Hyuga has a particular
Taijutsu passed down through generations.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.690
It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu that
Lee and I are good at…

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.270
Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.070
is mainly to inflict external damage
on our enemy,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.140
like broken bones and surface wounds.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.510
In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsu
inflict damage

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.940
on the Chakra Network through
which Chakra flow through the body,

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.910
and damaging the insides,
namely, it destroys internal organs.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.350
They possess the Gentle Fist.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.190
It’s not spectacular to watch…

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.520
but later it slowly takes effect.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.930
Well, you can’t train the internal organs…

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.230
Even if you were really robust,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.360
one hit from it would be
a deadly blow…

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.410
Even I can…

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.510
Hinata’s on the offensive…

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.520
Hinata…

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.220
Way to go, Hinata!

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.520
To attack the Chakra Network…

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.530
What are they, those people…?

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.960
Hey!

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:11.700
Hey!

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.530
Chakra Network, what’s that?!

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.930
Here we go again…

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.500
a question from a stupid guy.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.500
I’ll explain.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.670
They’re like blood canals.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.140
In the same way that blood flows
through vessels throughout the body,

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:30.180
They’re bundles of canals that take
Chakra’s into every corner of your body…

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.850
Oh!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.350
Like a path for Chakras, huh?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.290
Yes…

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.420
Furthermore, the Chakra Network
is closely connected

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:41.530
with the internal organs which
enfold Chakra within the body.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.530
That’s why if
the Chakra Network is attacked

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.930
the internal organs also suffer damage.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.270
Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.770
Hey you!
That's no way to talk to your senior!

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.850
It’s no wonder…

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.020
Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.450
That’s…

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.290
him.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.220
Sensei…

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.530
But, how can they do that?

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.560
After all, the Chakra Network
isn’t visible to the eyes.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.530
How do they attack the Chakra
line inside the body?

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:24.870
No.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.940
The eyes of those two…

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.510
They can see it with
their Byakugan.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.850
And a Gentle Fist attack is a little
different from a regular attack.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.520
They release their own Chakra

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.230
from a Chakra opening in their hand
and screw it into their opponent’s body.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.060
It directly inflicts damage on
your enemy’s Chakra Network.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.900
All right!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.500
Has she done it?

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.860
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:34.440
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:44.010
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:52.320
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.900
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:03.100
You won't have to search around you

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:06.640
It’s all ok now.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:15.510
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:21.050
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.520
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.430
Just sing.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.700
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.030
The two are one

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:43.470
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:48.980
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:55.150
Amazing!

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.350
That Hinata!

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.560
She’s always melancholy
and wishy-washy and…

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.690
I thought she is kinda weird, yet…

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.230
Even when she gets blow after blow,
she gets back up and goes.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.530
There’s something about
her way of fighting.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:06.730
Just a feeling,
but she resembles you, I think.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.200
Resembles me?
Hinata resembles me?

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.100
Now that I think about it, that girl,
she was always watching you.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:12.740
Huh?

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.870
Next episode: “A Failure Stands Tall!”

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.070
Hinata, fight!
