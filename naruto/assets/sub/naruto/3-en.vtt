WEBVTT

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.930
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.200
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.610
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.280
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.010
For no single one,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.030
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.830
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.330
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.700
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.670
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.110
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.680
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.190
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.830
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.900
Rockin' my heart

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820
Today's…a special day, so…

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.290
Time to eat!

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.830
Sasuke and Sakura: Friends or Foes?

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.800
Fight me, here!

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.040
What're you doing, Konohamaru?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.580
Very good, Naruto…

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.510
You're the man I expected you to be.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.120
I didn't do anything, you know…

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.990
Let's fight fair!

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.320
Sorry! I've got
an orientation meeting to go to.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.530
An orientation meeting…?

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.500
Cause… As of today, I'm a Ninja!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.930
Oh…

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.620
Sakura!
Shouldn't you be heading out soon?

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.720
I was thinking of leaving now!

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.830
Cha! How long are you planning
to treat me like a child?!

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.330
That's right… I'm not a student
of the academy anymore…

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.540
I'm a Kunoichi of the Leaf Village,
Sakura Haruno!

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040
I'm off!

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.380
Morning, Sakura.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.580
Morning... Ino.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.960
Who would've thought you'd
be able to graduate.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.400
Ancient history has nothing to do with it.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.030
As of today,
we're both full-fledged Ninjas...

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.800
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino!

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.230
What the--? Why are you here?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.200
Today's meeting is for graduates only.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.830
Hey, don't you see this headband?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.340
As of today, I'm a Ninja, too!

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.480
How can I put it, it really suits me.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.180
So Naruto…was able to graduate.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.990
Goal!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.730
I won again, Sakura!

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.930
What're you saying…?

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.800
The tip of my foot got in
one centimeter faster!

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.210
You must be blind.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.810
It's Sakura.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.010
Oh…

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.120
Sakura's looking at me…

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.450
Hey, Sakura!

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.620
Mor... morning, Sakur--

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.520
Get outta' the way!

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.830
M-Morning, Sasuke…

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.570
Mind if I sit next to you?

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.240
Hey! I'm going to sit
next to Sasuke!

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.770
First come, first served!

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.870
I got in the classroom sooner!

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.810
I did!

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.340
If that's the case,
then I did!

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.280
I was first!

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.650
I'm sitting next to Sasuke!

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
How annoying...

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.620
Is that this year's top rookie,
Sasuke Uchiha?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.090
Yes.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.960
The sole survivor of the Uchiha clan?

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.130
Yes.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.940
Naruto Uzumaki, eh…

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.830
Naruto! Don't glare at Sasuke!

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.700
Sakura…

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.200
Everyone's all Sasuke Sasuke.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.400
What's so great about this guy?!

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.740
Just beat him up, Sasuke!

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.810
Yeah! Yeah!

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.240
What? Really?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.710
Oh! Sorry!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.650
Wha--?

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:50.980
Whoa!

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:05.560
Cha! I was planning on
seizing Sasuke's first kiss!

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.870
You jerk…
Naruto! I'll kill you!

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.000
– My mouth is rotting.
– Huh? Was that my fault?

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.870
What? I feel rage…

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.980
Naruto…

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.210
You…

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.750
An accident…
lt was an accident

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.620
You are annoying!

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.820
Yikes!

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.820
Naruto…He's at
the center of trouble as usual.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.830
As of today, you all have become
full-fledged Ninjas…

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.400
However, you're still Genin.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.370
The tough part's still to come!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.170
From here on, you'll be in a squad of three

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.640
and carry out your missions
under your Jonin teachers.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.510
A squad of three?!

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.180
I wonder who's going to be
grouped with Sasuke.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.320
I don't know…

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.160
Cha! I'll be the one grouped
with Sasuke, naturally!

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.830
Squads of three, eh.
lt'll just slow me down…

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.200
First will be Sakura.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.540
And the other person…

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.810
can be anyone other than Sasuke!

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.340
The groups have been determined

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.080
so that the strength of
the groups will be balanced.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.380
Now for the assignments!

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.350
Now then, next is Group Seven…

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.290
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.820
Sakura Haruno.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.830
Hooray!

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.830
I'm with…Naruto…?

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.900
And…Sasuke Uchiha!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.700
Hooray!

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.830
I'm with…Sasuke…?

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.210
So I'll be in a different group
from Naruto, huh…

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.810
Next is Group Eight. Hinata Hyuga!

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.810
Y-Yes…

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.480
Kiba Inuzuka!

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.920
Shino Aburame!

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.220
Why is this happening…?

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.620
Group Nine.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.090
Cha! Love will be victorious!

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.130
Man…

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.500
Why do women think that
kind of guy's so great…?

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.870
Don't you understand, Shikamaru?

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.770
Well, I'm not a woman…

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.080
That's why you are
not popular among girls.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.710
I wouldn't want to be grouped with you.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.920
Group Ten. Ino Yamanaka.
 Shikamaru Nara.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.620
It appears we've been
grouped together.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.390
And Choji Akimichi.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.930
And Fatty on top of that...

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800
That's all for the group division.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.340
Iruka Sensei!

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.440
Why does an exceptional student
like me have to be

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.580
in the same group with this guy?!

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.280
Sasuke has the best grades
of the graduates.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.080
Naruto, you're at the bottom!

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.120
Of course, this is how it is when trying
to balance the strength within groups.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.330
Just don't get in my way, loser!

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.160
Hey, what did you say?!

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.400
You want to fight, loser?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.830
Knock it off, Naruto!!

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.770
In the afternoon,
I'll introduce you to your Jonin teachers.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.110
You're dismissed until then!

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.080
Sasuke!

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.910
Where'd you go, Sasuke?

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.820
I thought since we're in the same group
and all, we'd eat together.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.590
Sakuraaaa!

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.620
Since we're in the same group and all,
let's eat together!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.460
Why should I have to eat with you?!

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.630
Well... we're in the same group, so…

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.830
You're…annoying.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.800
Sasuke! Where are you?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.650
Darn! This is no fun.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.180
I 'm finally in the same group as Sakura…
and then it's like this…

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.190
I wonder if something good will happen…

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.530
That's it!

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.810
Listen up!

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.650
As long as we're in the same group,
you will follow my instructions.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:50.410
Yeah-yeah…

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.920
She becomes a real pain in the neck
when people try to argue with to her, so…

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.790
Let's all go out for
some BBQ sometime.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.490
Oh, man…

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.360
Hmm?

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.830
Naruto…?

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.630
Huh?

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.230
Oh!

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.340
Jerk, it's Naruto, isn't it!

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.940
Darn! Just be quiet.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:19.440
Naruto! I won't forgive you
if you hurt Sasuke!

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.590
What happened?

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.160
Heh! Idiot…

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.170
So Naruto got beaten by
the one he challenged…

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.570
Of course! Naruto's no match
 for Sasuke!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.110
No need for me to feel rushed…

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.110
From here on out,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.820
I'll be in the same group as
Sasuke for the long haul…

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:00.520
But…

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.090
Even if I were to use
my feminine charms…

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.160
my proportions are below average…

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.160
All that's above average is
 the width of my forehead…

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.230
What should I do…?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.800
Huh? No way!

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.670
Sasuke…is looking...

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:22.770
this way!

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.710
And with such a passionate look!

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.820
You…have a charmingly wide forehead.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.820
It makes me want to kiss it.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.820
That's what its surface area is for.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.830
Yeah, right…

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:45.460
I'm not just some kid
who believes in fairy tales…

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.330
There's no way.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.870
You…have a charmingly wide forehead.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:51.900
What?!

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.910
It makes me want to kiss it.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.620
Cha! This fairy tale is for real!!

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.820
Or that's what Naruto would say.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.830
I've got something to ask you.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:16.090
What?

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.860
What do you think…of Naruto?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.840
He's quite at home interfering and
enjoys it when I make mistakes.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.740
Naruto doesn't understand
one thing about me…

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.810
He just annoys me!

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.590
All I want…is for you to
accept me, Sasuke.…

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.820
For me to accept you…?

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.230
I'll do anything for the sake of that.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.710
I was careless!

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.620
W-Wha--?!

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.490
Gotcha!

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.590
I didn't think someone who couldn't
perform the Clone Jutsu properly

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.360
could do the Shadow Clone Jutsu.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.800
I'm…desperate, so…

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.670
I finally know why I…

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.410
I like Sakura so much.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.580
Diarrhea at a time like this?!

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.790
What's wrong?

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.520
I-I'll be right back…
225	01:41:53:26	01:41:56:04
Sasuke's so shy!

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.560
I guess he needs to
prepare himself mentally…

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.410
That was close!

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.640
My stomach hurt so much that
the Jutsu was about to wear off!

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.610
Why does my stomach have
to hurt at such a good time?!

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.020
I'm annoying... huh…

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.820
She said so again…

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.720
And I transformed into Sasuke and
had got a little closer to Sakura…

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.830
In that case…
I'll play an obnoxious Sasuke …

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.030
and make her hate him!

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.880
Oh Sasuke,
you're such a shy bad boy!

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.910
Are you prepared? I'm raring to go!

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.920
H-Hey, Sasuke!

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:56.420
Where's Naruto?

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.420
Oh, there you go changing
the subject again…

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.030
Just leave Naruto alone!

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.360
All he does is pick fights with you!

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.830
It's because he wasn't raised right!

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.230
You know!

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.200
He doesn't have any parents, right?

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.810
He always selfishly does
 whatever he wants!

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.780
My parents would get mad at me
if I did something like that!

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.480
There are no parents to nag you
if it's just you alone!

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.480
So his selfishness comes
out at various times!

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.750
The loneliness.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.650
Huh?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.860
It's something worse than getting
scolded by parents and...

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.960
W-What's gotten into you…?

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.730
You…

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.830
annoy me.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.880
Darn! It finally stopped!

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.580
I wonder if Sakura's still waiting.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.960
W-What are you doing here?!

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.900
I used the Escape Jutsu,
the very basic of techniques.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:12.830
Oh...

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.560
What were you planning to do…

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:15.830
by transforming into me?!

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.800
I thought it'd be fun, so I gave it a try!

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.580
The Shadow Clone Jutsu again?!

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.710
I'll show you that I'm really amazing!

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.210
I'll defeat you…

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.180
and make you accept me!

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.520
Prepare yourself, Sasuke!

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.460
Just like that, my stomach again…

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.330
B-Bathroom!

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:45.960
I'm first, I say!

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.060
I'm first, I say.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.830
I'm about to go in my pants, I say!

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.940
How stupid!

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.670
"You annoy me" …huh?

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.410
I see. So this is how
Naruto must've felt…

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.090
I wonder if I can…
be a bit more nice next time…

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.590
Darn.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.020
Did I eat something bad?

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.730
Naruto…

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.830
Smile…Smile…

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.000
Let's go back to the classroom, Naruto.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.800
Sakura…

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.410
Payback for earlier, huh?

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.740
Sasuke's turned himself into Sakura…

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.780
You're trying to trick me, right, Sasuke?!

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.910
I don't think so!

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.820
Ow-ow-ow…
What the heck is going on?!

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.960
Oh…

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.330
You idiot, Naruto!

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.740
So, this is Naruto's room…

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.540
And Sasuke of the Uchiha clan is
 also in the group you'll be in charge of.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:04.940
I wish you good luck!

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.080
The expiration date…

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.820
of this milk has passed quite awhile ago…

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.160
He'll get sick if he drink this.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.790
It seems like that things are
going to get disastrous.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.500
What the heck is going on?!

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.800
What is going on?!

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.540
This isn't the same Kakashi Sensei
from yesterday.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.740
Is this really the same Kakashi Sensei

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.610
who got caught in my trap
and breezily came late?

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.580
Darn it! Darn it!

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.210
No way am I giving up!

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.820
I'll defeat him and clear
this super difficult testl!

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.490
No way am I going back now!

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.420
Next episode:
 "Pass or Fail: Survival Test"

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.730
Don't miss my outstanding performance!
