WEBVTT

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.010
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.720
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.550
There is no way that I alone can
lose in a place like this!

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.590
Guy Sensei…please allow it.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.920
It is now…

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.900
A time to carry through and protect
one’s own Way of the Ninja!

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.110
The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.980
The color of his body changed…!

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.550
He’s red…?!

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.860
What’s up with him...?!

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.870
He’s opened the third gate,
the Gate of Life…

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.570
He’s going to make his move!

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.500
No, not yet!

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.470
What?!

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.270
And also,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.940
the fourth gate,
the Gate of Pain…open!

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
What an incredible guy…

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.420
It’s not as though effort alone
can make this happen…

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.920
That boy…

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.190
is he in fact a genius…?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.710
He’s fast!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.010
Gaara!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.710
Where are they?!

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:22.550
He’s above!

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:28.990
But we can’t find Lee!

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.560
Where?!

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.730
The sand isn’t keeping up at all!

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.470
So it’s the Sand Armor again…?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.440
Then how’s this?!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.960
What…?!

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.460
This Sand Armor is…

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.000
being peeled away…!

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.670
You’re a stubborn one.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.900
Since it comes to this…

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.610
The muscles have torn…

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.380
Is that really Lee…?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.350
When did he become like this…?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.550
This is the end!

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.320
The Fifth Gate of Closing…open!

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.560
I can’t defend myself…

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.400
Is this the movement of
a human being?!

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.600
Neji…

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.500
This technique is my ace in
the hole to take you down…

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.440
but I will specially show it to you!

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.710
Huh?!

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.960
The Sand Shield can’t keep up!

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.460
Most of the armor has also
 been peeled off…

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.730
He’s done for!

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.570
W-Wow!

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.540
Hidden Lotus… In other words...

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.340
it’s a high-speed continuous
Taijutsu that can’t even be touched!

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.940
The answer to take Neji down is
that high speed combination…

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.510
There is no way that
the sand can keep up!

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.320
This technique will be the last!

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.590
Hidden Lotus!

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.500
I can’t see anything, it’s too fast…

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.650
That’s impossible…

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.720
The gourd has turned to sand…?

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.860
He’s done it this time!

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.100
Gaara!

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.960
Lee…

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.970
Oh!

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.800
What’s…that?

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.820
He protects himself…

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.890
using a gourd made of sand?!

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.950
That technique is…!

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.620
Sand Coffin!

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.470
No way!

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.430
He got hit by the Hidden Lotus

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.970
and is still able to bring
forth a technique…!

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.550
Sand Coffin!

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.230
I just can not lose in a place like this…

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.560
I want to…

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.870
my Way of the Ninja…

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.140
Oh no!

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.850
Die!

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.560
Why…?

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.730
Why…save him?

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.630
He’s…

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.840
I’m all right!

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.540
I’m strong so…

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.540
The Chunin Exam…

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.080
Guy Sensei, please watch
me with a smile...

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.680
I’d like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.350
even though I can’t use Ninjutsu!

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.680
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.650
He is...

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.560
an important subordinate
whom I care for!

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.540
A subordinate…whom I care for...?

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.120
Those words are definitely
not understandable to Gaara…

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.460
I quit…

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.230
He quit…?

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.430
The moment Guy jumped in,
Lee lost.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600
The winner…

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.840
Gaa-!

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.070
– Wha…? 					– Huh?

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.980
– Huh? 					– Huh?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.110
Wha--?!

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.760
That’s impossible…

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.540
Having opened the fifth gate…

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.980
And his hand and feet are crushed…

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.980
There’s no way he should
be able to stand…!

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:11.550
Lee…

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.550
It’s all right.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.980
It’s over!

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.420
You’re in no condition to stand…!

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.560
Lee…

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.960
Y-You…

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.600
You are…

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.310
Even after having
lost consciousness…

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.710
You still want to prove your
own Way of the Ninja…?

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.750
So he had already…

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.220
lost consciousness…

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.590
Lee...

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.230
You’re already…

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.070
a respectable Ninja…!

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.540
The winner…

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.710
Gaara.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.090
Lee!

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.100
Stop!

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.130
Even if you went down
what could you do?

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.540
Your words of encouragement
would only make him feel worse.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.460
There’s no way he could
have beaten Gaara…

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.430
He was faced with a tougher battle
than we thought…

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.570
That Naruto…

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.650
Bushy Brow lost
to a guy like this…!

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.360
Medics, please hurry.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.900
Bushy Brow…

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.300
Lee…

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.560
You are the Jonin in charge of him,
aren’t you?

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.300
Y-Yes.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.570
Please come with me
for a minute.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:21.470
Careful…

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.140
Don’t shake him.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.760
There is faint breathing…

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.560
but because of comminuted fractures
and muscle tears to his entire body,

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.560
recovery will likely to take
quite some time…

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.500
If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad, but…

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.450
The damage to the left arm
and leg which received the attack is severe…

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.410
It’s too severe…

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.550
Oh…!

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.560
I don’t want to say this,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.560
but he won't be able to...
live as a Shinobi again.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.010
T-That…

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.650
that can’t be true…

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.020
I will take Bushy Brow down.
Believe it!

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.350
It is not you whom I want to fight,
it’s Uchiha!

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560
You…!

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.730
Naruto, I get where you're
coming from, believe me.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.670
But all fighting must be done
officially in a match!

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.540
The failure beats the gifted genius
through sheer effort…

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.540
Wouldn't that make for
an exciting main battle?

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.810
Though, I am probably going
 to be the one fighting Neji…

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.550
Lee…

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.420
I didn’t want to think... that you’d lose.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.460
I wanted to let you fulfill…

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.560
your Way of the Ninja!

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.500
Yay!

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.560
I finally mastered it!

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.870
Yahoo!

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:30.770
This technique…

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.600
after all, only Lee managed to master…

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.810
Okay, you became Genin
 from today.

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.310
I want to hear what it is
you all are aiming for!

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.550
I-I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.820
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.720
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.860
Please forgive me for not…

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.930
stopping it...!

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.570
Lee…

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.970
It’s not true…it’s not true.

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:14.340
After hearing that,
what should Bushy Brow do…?!

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.550
This guy…

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.920
He said the failure would take
down a genius with effort…!

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:23.820
Isn’t there something that
can be done?!

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.920
Calm down, Naruto.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.560
B-But…Kakashi Sensei!

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.870
He kept saying he wanted
to battle Sasuke and Neji!

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.070
Perhaps…that led to his ruin.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.140
To fulfill that dream…

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.380
the boy even used a self-sacrificing
forbidden technique to try to win!

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.380
The result is what you see…

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.860
That boy…

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.560
Sasuke and Neji…

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:04.360
and you…

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.370
he sacrificed himself to
a promise he never spoke of.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.300
He risked his life…

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.770
so that he might have
a chance to battle you guys…

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.810
Don't forget that…

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.960
I wonder if Lee…

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:34.560
will be all right…?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.760
Lee…

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.930
You didn’t realize it even at the end…

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.770
Heaven does not allow it.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.540
One who tries to move ahead
while achieving victory

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.150
through a method like dying
upon each other’s swords.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.900
So it ended without incident…

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.530
Welcome back Gaara.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.550
Guy…

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:38.960
Well…

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.960
I spoke self-importantly earlier but…

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.060
I’ve thought about it and
had I been in your position…

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.930
I probably... wouldn’t have
been able to stop him.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.870
Guy.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.810
We’re in the way of the
next tournament…let’s go up.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.550
All right…

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.030
Then, the tenth and final round is next,
both contestants come forward!

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.930
So it’s finally my turn…

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.140
I’m gonna win and have
some barbecued beef!

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.510
In any case, I need to last until
the main tournament and battle Sasuke.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.250
Or I will not have met your expectations,
Lord Orochimaru…

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.550
I can almost see through it…

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.560
The reason that you went to the trouble
of getting to Sasuke before us and...

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.790
putting a Curse Mark on him
without killing him…

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.100
In other words,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.900
we were the guinea pigs to measure
Sasuke’s abilities during the examinations.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.540
What you wanted isn’t Sasuke’s life,
but Sasuke himself…

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:07.740
I was also taken for a fool…

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.720
Now, let the tenth round begin.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.760
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:32.340
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:41.950
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:50.220
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.830
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.000
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.570
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:13.540
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.980
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:23.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.360
Just sing.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.600
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.930
The two are one

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.400
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.880
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.350
Sakura!

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.190
Do you know where
Kakashi Sensei is?

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.750
Naruto...

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:59.260
I’m gonna have him watch
my training until the main tournament.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.560
Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.600
What’s up with you, Sakura?
You seem a little down.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.130
No, nothing…

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.900
It’s just that I get this bad feeling…

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.240
Next episode: “A Shadow in Darkness:
Danger Approaches Sasuke”

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.540
I feel uneasy for some reason…
