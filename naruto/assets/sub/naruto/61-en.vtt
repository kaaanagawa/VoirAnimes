WEBVTT

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:09.650
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:17.900
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.190
One more time

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.900
Are you really happy

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.440
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.150
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.820
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.440
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.690
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:02.770
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.770
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.900
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.770
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.770
One more time

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.030
His opponent is that Neji, huh…?

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.320
The Final Round is altogether different
than the preliminaries…

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.610
After all, Naruto may not be able to…

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.940
Entertain me a little, Naruto.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.690
I’ve got a tough job waiting
for me now, so…

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.190
Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.480
Dang it. I can’t catch him at all.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.770
I told you I’m not
such a fool, didn’t I?

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.780
I already know…
which one is the real one.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.770
Oh.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.820
That is the body
that has least attacks

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.770
due to its fear of having
Chakra Points attacked.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.610
The more you attack,

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.650
the more that one body
becomes clearly evident.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.980
You’re the real one.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.530
Naruto…

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.360
This is as far as it goes.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.360
I said it was pointless.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.770
Don’t let him beat you, Naruto.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.400
I’ve been telling you not
to frivolously assume things.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.730
What?

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.400
It can’t be.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.730
All right! Go, Naruto!

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.820
Naruto…!

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.570
He foiled my idea and purposely
and drew one of his clones back?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.530
I’ve been striking from the beginning,
prepared for an honorable death!

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:47.440
Believe it!

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.650
I did it.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.730
That’s…

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.900
W-What was that?

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.980
Did you think you’d won?

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.530
Why?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.770
Naruto’s punch should’ve hit.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.280
That…

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.150
Rotation...

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.110
That’s Neji’s defense.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.770
You punk.
Don’t make a fool of me.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.280
The largest range of vision of
Neji’s Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.770
And he detects all of his opponent’s
attacks with the Byakugan.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.190
His defense technique,
the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.360
will begin from here.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.650
The moment he’s attacked,
he discharges a large amount of Chakra

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.770
from the Chakra holes in the body,
blocks the enemy’s attack with that Chakra,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.900
moves his own body in a circular motion,
dodges and repels.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.690
Essentially, it’s difficult to control
the Chakra discharged from Chakra holes…

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.610
To the extent that even Jonin utilize
the discharge from a part of the body,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.480
like the hands and feet,
in techniques.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.980
But Neji who has mastered
Gentle Fist discharges Chakra

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.280
from his entire body and
shuts out physical attacks

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.150
just with that discharge power.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:56.770
In other words,

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.770
that’s one more absolute defense

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.770
that has more power
than that Gaara’s Sand Shield.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.150
T-That’s father’s…

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.360
The Rotation is a secret Art passed down
from generation to generation

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.770
only to the Hyuga head family,
in other words the Hyuga clan.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.110
He created that on his own…?

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.900
He’s quite the guy…
To think he’d come this far.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.360
It’s much too soon to be surprised.
Neji’s true power is still to come.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.900
Dang it.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.980
This is the end.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.940
You’re within the area of my 8 Trigrams.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.400
Gentle Fist Art.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.440
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.770
It can’t be.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.190
That pose.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.110
8 Tetragrams…

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.940
…2 Palms!

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.400
4 Palms.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.770
8 Palms.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.610
16 Palms.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.110
32 Palms.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.940
64 Palms!

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.770
The branch family exceeds
the head family?

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.030
It’s over.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.400
Truly a terrifying talent.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.610
To think the power of the
Hyuga Kekkei Genkai

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.770
would be passed on so strongly
to a child of the branch family

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.770
who would never be able
to be an heir.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.900
Hizashi… You should have
succeeded the Hyuga family.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.530
I pressed the 64 Chakra Points
all over your body…

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.730
You can’t even stand.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.360
D-Dang it.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.150
Are you frustrated?

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.190
Kneeling down before power
that can’t be changed

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.030
and knowing your powerlessness.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.480
Your dreams will come true
if you just work hard.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:40.860
That’s just an illusion.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.770
Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.480
Oh, man. I knew it.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.650
Naruto.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.900
Bushy brow…

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.770
Hinata.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.650
D-Dang it.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.190
Oh.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.150
Naruto.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.480
He… No way.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.030
I told you, didn’t I…?

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.610
I don’t know when to give up.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.190
No way.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.110
Hey, you’re bleeding.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.730
What’s wrong?

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.770
You’ve still got damage
from the match.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.110
Hinata… Hang in there.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.860
I’ll take a look at her.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.480
Who’re you?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.690
I’m not suspicious or anything.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.150
Stop already…

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440
It’ll be the same even if
you fight more than this.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.730
I don’t have a grudge particularly
against you.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.770
S-Shut up…

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.820
Even if you say so,
I have something against you.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.570
What are you talking about?

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.280
Why…? Here you’re this strong…

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:10.230
Why did you, with a look like
you’ve seen through it all,

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.780
go after Hinata mentally
who was trying so hard?

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.320
It has nothing to do with you.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.570
Mocking Hinata, selfishly labeling
her a failure as you please.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.690
Head family, branch family…

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.610
I don’t know what happened to you.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:36.280
But I won’t forgive the jerk who’d
call another person a failure.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.980
Hey, you.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.650
It’s okay. I’m a doctor.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.780
Okay… Fine.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:55.280
If you insist, I’ll tell you about
the Hyuga’s destiny of hatred.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.530
In the Hyuga head family,
there’s a secret Ninjutsu

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.530
that’s been passed on
from generation to generation.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.900
That is the Curse Mark Arts.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.770
Curse Mark Arts?

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.900
The Curse Mark represents
a bird in a cage…

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.900
and it’s a mark of those who are
bound to a destiny they can’t escape.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.770
W-What’s…

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.770
...t-that mark?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.030
One day when I was four years old,

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:57.190
this accursed mark was inscribed
on my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.940
A large ceremony was held in
the Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.780
It was also the day when the
head Ninja of the Land of Lightning,

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.190
the land that the Leaf had
fought with for many years,

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.770
came for the conclusion
of the allied treaty.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.070
However, there was one clan…

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.610
who didn’t attend the ceremony
that was attended

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.610
by everybody else,
from Leaf Jonin to Genin.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.400
It was the Hyuga clan…

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.360
And it’s because that day
was the day of hope

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.770
when the head family heir
was to turn three.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.110
Miss Hinata’s third birthday!

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.610
My father, Hizashi Hyuga,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:57.480
and Miss Hinata’s father who’s over there,
Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:01.860
However, Miss Hinata’s father,
Lord Hiashi,

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.770
is the eldest son of the head family
born into this world first.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.480
And my father who was the second son
is a member of the branch family.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.860
So Miss Hinata is already three…

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.440
Congratulations.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.530
Thank you.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.770
She’s a cute girl, isn’t she, father?

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.650
What’s wrong, father?

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.980
Oh, it’s nothing.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.150
Then…

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.860
I’ll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.150
Yes.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.770
When the head family heir grew
and became three years old,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.940
I had the Curse Mark imprinted on me
and I became the bird in the cage.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.190
And became the Hyuga branch family.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.780
Why’s it necessary to do
something like that?

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.940
Why separate into a head family
and a branch family?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.650
What does that weird mark mean?

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.570
This mark on my forehead
isn’t just a decoration.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.690
The pull of your legs is weak.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.530
Yes.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.030
Listen, Neji.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:38.230
You will live to protect Miss Hinata
of the head family

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.110
as well as the Hyuga power.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.530
Yes, father.

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.440
Murderous Intent.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.770
My head.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:16.770
Father.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.650
What’s wrong, father?

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:27.770
Go home.
I’ll forgive the fool today only.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.770
You’re not to forget your destiny.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.770
This Curse Mark is the absolute fear
called death so to speak…

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.150
that was given to the branch family
by the head family.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.360
The Secret Sign that the
head family members form easily

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.770
destroys the cerebral nerves
of those in the branch family.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.940
Of course, killing is easy.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.770
And this mark only goes away
at time of death.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.320
Sealing away the power
of the Byakugan.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.780
The Hyuga family is the clan that possesses
the most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.150
There’s no end to those who
target the secret of that distinctive power.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:20.570
In other words, this Curse Mark
keeps the branch family alive

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.860
only to protect the head family
and does not allow disobedience.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.440
And it’s an effective system created
to defend for eternity

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.770
the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.730
And then, that incident occurred.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.770
My father was killed by
the head family.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.570
One night, Miss Hinata was
snatched up by someone.

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:19.770
At that time, Lord Hiashi immediately
rushed off and killed the abductor.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.780
Who do you think that person was…

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.110
who was in the shadows,
and also wearing a mask?

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.030
It was the head ninja of
the Land of Lightning

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.780
who had just completed
the allied treaty.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.480
It was clear that he came targeting
the secret of Byakugan from the start.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.320
However, the Land of Lightning
exploited the killing of their own Ninja

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.860
due to a botched plan…

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.770
and set an outrageous condition in
violation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.980
Naturally, things got worse and worse,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.650
and there was almost a war
between the Leaf and the Lightning.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.400
However, the Leaf who
wanted to avoid war

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.280
made a deal with the Lightning.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.320
A deal?

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.440
The Lightning demand was
the body of the Hyuga head family

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.320
who possesses Byakugan,
the Kekkei Genkai…

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.070
In other words,
the body of Lord Hiashi.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.530
And the Leaf accepted the condition.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.320
What? But, father…

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.230
And war was safely avoided.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:40.400
Thanks to my father who was killed
as a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.690
to protect the head family!

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.860
Other than dying, there’s no other way
to escape this accursed Curse Mark.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.230
Even though they were twins
with nearly equal power,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:57.770
their destinies were already set by
who was born first and born later.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.480
And then, this match…

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.440
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:29.190
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.690
Two! He kisses and hugs everyone
randomly and says “I LOVE YOU”

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.070
Three! Masala masters Yoga

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.440
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:45.770
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:53.110
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.940
One! Bodimahattaya-san devotes
his time for digging black ships

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.400
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,
Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.770
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:17.030
Four! Japanese people,
now lend me you hand!

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:23.320
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:30.770
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:37.230
All over the world, the sky’s smiling,
so look up and smile too

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:44.530
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.610
Are all my Chakra Points
really closed?

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.980
Darn. I cannot feel any Chakra
remaining in my body at all…

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:03.820
just like when I used up all my Chakra
in my training with the Pervy Sage.

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.190
Wait. I got it. Just watch me!

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.360
I will squeeze out
my Chakra no matter what!

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.730
Next time,  “A Failure’s True Power.”
