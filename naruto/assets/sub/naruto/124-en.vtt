00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.760
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.590
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.970
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.140
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.300
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.850
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.720
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.760
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.010
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.680
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.640
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.760
The Beast Within

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.260
Sasuke!

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.300
Why…?!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.010
Why do you run away?!

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.050
Sasuke!

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.350
Don’t…

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.260
be staring at…

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.590
people!

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.600
He’s faster than earlier!

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.970
The medicine from earlier…

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.720
Was there some kind of
special ingredient in it or something…?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.050
Not…bad…

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.510
Moving around kind of…
made me feel super weird…

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.390
Oh, my…!

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.010
What was that…all of a sudden…?

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.800
Did he really…fall asleep…?

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.600
You fell for it, eh?!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.930
It looked like I was sleeping,
but actually I wasn’t!

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.550
This is the Shinobi secret…!

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.180
Guy Sensei…I did it!

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.180
Guy Sensei…I…I…

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.350
You fell for it yet again, huh?!
Hey!

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.350
You’re sorely mistaken
if you think I’m the kind of person

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.590
to sleep spread-eagle
in a place like this!

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.680
I…I…

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.600
What…? What am I doing
in a place like this…?

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.510
What…?

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.220
Why…? Why…?

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.300
Alcohol…?

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.220
He’s just drunk, huh…?

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.350
If so…I’ll send you to another world
before you can even feel pain…

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.430
Damn it…
I don’t have enough Chakra…

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.590
At this rate…

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.680
As might be expected,
things will get hairy

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.590
if I stay in the water any longer
with this wound…

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.590
Why won’t it hit?!

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.350
And here I was sleeping comfortably…

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.100
You’re a buzzing, annoying fly!

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:04.390
Hey! Bring it on! Hey c’mon…
I’ll show you…

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.590
What’re…those movements…?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.140
As you know, in that technique…

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.220
one gets stronger the more one drinks
and the more one gets drunk.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.010
I know…

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.970
At the restaurant before…

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.100
When Lee mistook it for water
and drank a small cup of alcohol…

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.600
It took Neji and me, the both of us,
to finally…be able to overpower Lee.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.050
You couldn’t restrain him yourself…?

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.100
I could overpower him
if I was fighting him as an enemy…

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.590
But well, I couldn’t inflict a serious injury
on my beloved student…

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.590
That’s right…

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.050
That’s how it was
just with one small cup, so…

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.760
If he were to drink
an entire bottle of alcohol…

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.970
An invincible strength, huh…?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.720
But it’s just after
he got out of the hospital.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.680
How long will his body
hold on for…?

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.430
A Loopy Fist User, huh…?
lt’s my first time seeing one…

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:43.010
If you’re not going to come…
then I’ll go!

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.140
His attacks are straight as usual…

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.550
Oh!

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.470
Ouch!

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.010
It’s your fault!

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.760
I…I…!

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.590
I’m enjoying my youth!

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.590
He’s too unorthodox…

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.470
And most of all…he’s fast!

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.590
Right in the middle of my youth…

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.140
Dance of the Camellia!

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.590
Here!

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.100
I can’t read his movements…

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.140
An attack on me…
That’s quite some Taijutsu…

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.100
I have no choice…

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.590
My attack ability is bones…

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.590
You heard that earlier
from the Clone brat, right…?

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.350
I’ll sober you up right away.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.590
I’m…not drunk…or anything!

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.600
Then I’ll wake you up!

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.930
I’m not drunk or anything!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.850
In the first place, I’m a minor!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.970
Minors shouldn’t drink at all!

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.590
Unorthodox, isn’t it…?
This is my Kekkei Genkai.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.850
Calm down…Think of a strategy…

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:22.590
Seek…some kind of possibility…

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.390
Humph. With that wound…

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.350
It seems he wasn’t able
to escape very far at all…

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.220
This is my limit…
I can’t move…

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.850
Damn it…
He’s already caught up?

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.680
And…

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.590
My head’s pounding…

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.260
And what’s with this wound…?

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.140
It seems I was drunk, eh…?

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.930
Your appearance…!

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.010
It seems you’ve sobered up…
This is my Kekkei Genkai…

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.050
Kekkei Genkai…

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:57.800
My Kekkei Genkai freely controls
osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells…

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.140
It even controls the concentration
of calcium. It's an ability to form bones.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.930
Basically, there are over two hundred
bones in the human body…

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.890
But for me, that’s not a set number.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.590
But bones are bones, after all!

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.600
If they break, they break!

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.850
Wh-What a hardness…!

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.430
Are these really human bones…?!

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.050
If so…!

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.300
Larch Dance.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:14.350
I’ve had it…

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.640
A little more…you clod.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.350
It’s not like the time before with Asuma…

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.140
A-Asuma!

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.140
There’s probably zero possibility
of someone coming to help...

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:49.850
Hey, what’s the point of thinking
about someone helping…?!

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.760
Calm down!

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.550
The smell is moving away…

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.590
I’m saved…

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.510
Who is?

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.590
How…?!

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:00.550
I knew it…

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:04.800
My coat?!

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.590
It seems you didn’t notice your own smell
that you’re routinely used to smelling…

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.640
With that you erased your own smell?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:22.550
You understand well the attributes of scent.
lt figures why I didn’t smell you.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.680
And…as would be expected,

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.890
it’s tough having you guys split up in two
to search for me…

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.510
Damn it…

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.640
Please wait!

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.260
The real deal…is from now!

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.590
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible…

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.100
So, I should’ve avoided a big technique
that could be self-defeating…

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.220
But it seems this isn’t an opponent
easy enough to be able to beat

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.930
without using my Secret Technique…

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.590
Here I go!

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.590
I just had surgery
and am not at my best.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.350
But if it’d just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, The Gate of Opening,

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.850
I should somehow…

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.100
The first gate… Gate of Opening…

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.510
Open!

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.590
Primary Lotus!

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.930
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones…?!

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:47.590
That’s some speed… But it’s over.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.800
Damn it… No matter how much I think,
I can’t come up with any good strategies!

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.600
I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.510
With me right in front of you,
you can’t even howl like a loser…?

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.970
Eh?!

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.590
Die!

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.850
You’re mine!

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.590
Don’t you be smiling
before you’re going to die!

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.720
What?!

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:38.640
Who’re you?!

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.590
Heh… It seems
you’re an ally this time…

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:57.640
Who’re you?!

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.590
A Sand…

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.180
Shinobi…

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.470
ally of the Leaf!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.590
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.640
And you smiled

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.180
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.050
In my own words

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.600
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:46.260
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.850
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.590
You listened without turning away

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.800
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.140
I feel so sad

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.100
But…

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.470
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.590
And you smiled

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.050
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.470
In my own words

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.600
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.100
And you smiled

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.590
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.590
In my own words

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:42.260
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.590
I heard that the Sand and Leaf
had made up, but…

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.050
It wasn’t that we attacked the Leaf Village
for the fun of it.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.220
It was just a mission, same as this time.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.800
Humph! I see.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.800
By the way, weren’t you three
headed this way together?

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.890
We had no choice.
Since you guys are weak…

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:11.850
Idiot. Don’t take them lightly.
These guys are out of the ordinary.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:16.260
Next episode,
“The Sand Shinobi: Allies of the Leaf”
