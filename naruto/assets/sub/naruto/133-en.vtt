00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.720
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.470
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.260
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.590
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.600
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.050
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.510
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.010
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.470
All the kids said

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.470
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.680
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.350
All the kids said

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.180
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800
All the kids said

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.100
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.430
All the kids took off

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.850
into this windless night

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.390
Because they want to change something

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.100
Plea from a Friend

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.590
That's Naruto?

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.510
What is this intimidating power?

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.470
And what was that
red Chakra earlier on?

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.350
Is this guy a monster?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.800
What the heck are you?!

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.590
Your friend!

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.720
That’s why I’m telling you

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.510
I’m not gonna let the likes
of Orochimaru get you!

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.590
I’m telling you that I’ll stop you…

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.300
even if it means breaking
every bone in your arm and legs!

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.590
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.550
Come on! Wake up, already!

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.470
If you don’t come to your senses,
I'll have to break your bones

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.890
so that you can’t move
and I'll take you home that way, Sasuke!

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.850
Shut up…

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.930
What the heck do you,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.600
who has neither parents nor brothers,
think you understand?

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.850
What makes you think that you,
who's been all alone from the start,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.100
can understand anything about me?!

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.510
It’s because I have the ties
that I feel this agony.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.590
How could you possibly understand…

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.180
what it feels like to lose all that!

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.590
It’s true that I can’t understand…

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.010
how it feels to really
have parents or brothers…

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.550
However…

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.430
It’s my treat today…
Eat your fill!

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.220
Yippee!

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.220
When I’m with Iruka Sensei,
I imagine…

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.970
– Dig in! 					– Dig in!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.970
Ninja, first of all, need to
warm their inner man.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.590
Hey! Hey! Don’t get too carried away
and overeat!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.470
If this is…
what it feels like to have a dad.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.680
When I’m with you…

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.720
Idiot, idiot, idiot…

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.050
What was that, you loser?!

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.220
I’m not gonna lose to you,
no matter what!

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.760
Go ahead and say
whatever you want.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.590
How about this?

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.590
Better not start feeling
too comfortable.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.180
I wonder…if having a brother
feels something like that.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.220
Why is it, Naruto…?

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.930
Why is it that you go to
this extent for me…?

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.720
For me it’s a tie that
I’ve finally been able to have!

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.720
That’s why I’m gonna stop you.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:14.590
It’s too late, Naruto…
lt’s already too late.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.350
I can’t go back anymore.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.470
Come, Naruto!

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.800
In that case,
I just have to cut that tie.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.180
Cut, huh?

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.590
Then why wear that headband now?

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.430
I’ll acknowledge you…
You’re strong.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.590
And the reason for that is

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.590
you’re someone who knows
the pain of solitude as I do.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.930
And that pain makes people stronger.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.590
And for that very reason,
by cutting that tie,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.470
I will be able to obtain
even greater strength.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.590
I will fight you now on equal terms.
However…

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.760
You won't even be able to
inflict a scratch on my forehead.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.050
That’s something that
won’t change in the least.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.300
It seems that whatever I say
won’t have any effect anymore, huh?

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.300
Sasuke!

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.600
I’m done with talking…

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.050
From here on, it’s only fighting.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.890
Come!

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:00.590
I’m able to see…

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.590
I’m now able to see
this guy’s movements…

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.720
which I wasn’t able to see before.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.590
I’m able to see them!

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.220
Sasuke’s moving completely
different from a few moments ago.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.050
But I couldn’t care less!

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.100
In any case, I can’t afford to lose!

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.590
Damn it!

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.140
It must be the influence of my body
getting used to the state of Curse Mark.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.590
When he moves…

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.680
by the subtle movements in
the way he exerts his strength…

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.050
I can vividly see
an image of his next move.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.890
With my level of “eyes,”

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.800
I don’t need to use unnecessary Chakra
and can instead preserve it.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.970
The Curse Mark takes
too much Chakra.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.590
If I can see this much…

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:38.350
I can time my attacks to the images of
Naruto’s movements as I foresee them.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.140
This is no good…

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.430
He’s totally reading my movements.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:04.760
Damn it!

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.970
Oh, there you are.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.590
There’s no mistake it’s this way, right?

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.390
Right.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:28.550
We better hurry.
I have a bad premonition.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.850
Sasuke!

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.930
Fire Style:
Dragon Flame Jutsu!

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.220
Sa-su-ke…

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.590
It’s too late, Naruto.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.890
It’s too late now! Naruto!

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.220
You're weak, aren’t you, kid?

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.800
You better be grateful to me…

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.300
and to the Fourth Hokage

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.930
who contained me within
the likes of you!

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.720
What’s going on?

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.350
What was that just now?

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.970
Even if I’m able to read
Naruto’s movements completely…

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.640
his Chakra makes
a separate move of its own.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.850
It seems like the Chakra itself is moving
in accordance with its own will…

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.050
Even with my “eyes”
I’m unable to read it completely.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.680
That red Chakra…
that’s not an ordinary Chakra!

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.100
Your target is Naruto, after all.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.640
To abduct Naruto
is the No.1 priority

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.050
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.850
I see…

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:40.590
It appears that you have
some kind of special power.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.590
Now I understand!

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.590
Fire Style:
Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.050
That Chakra is protecting him?!

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:23.180
Calm down.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.470
I won’t be caught as long as
I fight from distance.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:27.050
Damn it… This is incredible!

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.590
All I can do is dodge…

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.300
Please let me get there in time.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.300
Damn it, gimme a break…

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.680
If I get tainted by this power …

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.430
I don’t even know what
will happen to me in the end…

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.550
But, it can’t be helped,
can it, Naruto?

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.590
It is certainly true
that you were special…

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.930
However…

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.010
I am even more special than you.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.350
Sasuke!

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:27.430
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:33.640
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:44.350
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:54.050
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.800
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:10.180
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:21.800
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:32.350
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.010
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.140
Damn! My body hurts!

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:53.100
And to make it worse,

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.260
I’ve completely lost feeling
in my left arm!

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.590
Apparently this power
isn’t something that

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.800
I can just keep on using continuously!

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.470
But …I can’t give up!

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.720
My next blow is
going to be the end!

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.800
Next episode: “The End of Tears”
