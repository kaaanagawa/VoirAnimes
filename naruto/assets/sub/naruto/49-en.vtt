WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.190
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.090
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.960
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.450
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.020
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.410
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.720
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.550
What?!

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.020
O-Oh!

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:51.560
T-That’s…

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.260
It's the empty shell of sand!

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.470
Lee's Hidden Strength:
Forbidden Secret Jutsu!

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.170
When did that…?!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.540
That’s not possible!

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.840
While you had your eyes closed
and were praying.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.610
What?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.710
For a moment, Lee stopped moving
because of the pain in his body.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.220
At that moment…that’s when!

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.930
Gaara!

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.550
That's...!

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.010
There’s no doubt about it – his eyes…

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.720
He’s completely awake…

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.090
The demon…inside him.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.450
Run away!

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.560
That Bowl-Cut’s totally worn down…

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.400
Gaara is toying with him.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.000
W-Why doesn’t Lee dodge?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.470
With Lee’s speed, he should easily be
able to dodge that level of attack.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.650
It’s not that he doesn’t dodge,
it’s that he can’t dodge.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.550
What?!

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.650
What do you mean?

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.190
The Lotus is a double-edged sword.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.920
What do you mean double-edged sword?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.330
Why do you think the Lotus is
a forbidden technique?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.830
Well…

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.100
The Lotus isn’t a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.430
It’s a Taijutsu, with that much
high-speed movement.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.500
The load it puts on a person’s body
is beyond imagination.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.840
So Lee’s entire body is in
so much pain right now

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.340
that even moving is out of the question.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.210
Isn’t that so…

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.510
Guy?

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.750
But that’s…!

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.210
He has no Ninjutsu, not even
one Genjutsu …

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.850
Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.220
it’s now even less than
an average person’s …

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.550
There’s no way he can win!

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.860
He’s had it if this goes on…

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.930
Lee…

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.540
Hey, get a move on all of you.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.610
I’ll add another 200 laps!

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.340
Stupid! There’s no way
you’ll become a Ninja.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.550
Yes, I will.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.650
There’s no way a chump who can’t
even use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.550
Yes, I will!

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.550
Whatever, but the fact that a guy like
you without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.420
and with less Taijutsu than
an average person

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.760
is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.800
Do you know what you’re called here?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.430
Hot-Blooded!

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.900
Hot-Blooded!

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.670
Hot-Blooded lose-

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.540
Hey, get in line, Lee!

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.710
Hey Lee!

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.110
So that’s the hot-blooded loser
everyone’s talking about.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.910
Doesn’t he look like
someone we know?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.750
Huh?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.520
In particular…his eyebrows.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.550
Hmm…

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.020
Rock Lee…

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.560
The chump who can only perform
less than average Taijutsu…

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.230
But you...

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.770
You practiced your less
than average Taijutsu …

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.340
You practiced it over and
over again like crazy…

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.680
396…397…398…399…

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.650
400…401…402…403…

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.550
If I can’t do a log kick 500 times,
then it’s 1,000 squats!

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.560
413... 414...

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.560
415... 416... 417... 418...!

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.430
419... 420…

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.630
So someone’s here before me…

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.540
422… 423... 424...

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.540
425... 426...

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.710
I suppose I’ll come back…

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.320
If I can’t do 1,000 squats,
then it’s 2,000 punches!

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.560
795… 796… 797… 798…

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.800
He’s still at it…!

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.640
2,000 punches!

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.540
If I can’t, it’s 2,000 jump ropes!

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.520
You recklessly practiced only
Taijutsu and eventually…

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.320
All right, you’ve all become
Genin as of today,

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.960
so I’d like to know what
it is you’re all aiming for!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.470
Tenten.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:14.670
I’d like to become a powerful Ninja
like the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.770
Hmm...

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.980
And, how about you, Neji?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.880
I don’t want to answer…

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.420
I…!

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.690
I’d like to prove that I could
become a respectable Ninja

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.190
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.960
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Those are good serious eyes…

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.000
Humph!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.100
You!

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.160
What’s so funny?!

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.470
I’m serious!

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.540
I will become a respectable Ninja
even only with Taijutsu!

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.110
He should give up already…

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.940
At this rate…

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.110
He will simply die with Gaara
just toying with him…

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.550
Bushy Brows…!

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.720
Lee…

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.440
Not yet… Not yet!

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.710
Lee, you just won’t learn
your lesson, will you?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.550
There’s no way you can win…

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.350
Unlike you, Neji is a genius.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.550
A genius…?

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.390
What is a genius?!

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.560
Even though I may not have talent,
I’ll exceed genius with my efforts.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.130
That is my entire being!

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.430
That is my Way of the Ninja!

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.230
You’ll get nowhere, Lee…

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.540
No matter how much effort you make,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.800
there’s no way you can take me down.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.570
That’s simply a fact.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.880
That's not true!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.340
That’s not…

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.560
But you…refused to give up, not ever!

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.760
Such meaningless actions…

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.570
The Bowl-Cut was unlucky to
have Gaara as his opponent!

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.670
No…

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.640
Lee’s not one to give up
with this much.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.540
– What? 					– Huh?

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.940
The reason is that Lee…

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.490
The reason is that Lee…

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.550
You…continued to make effort.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.500
If I can’t jump rope 1,200 times,
I’ll log kick 2,000 times!

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.160
1,116... 1,117...!

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.430
1,118... 1,11--!

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.270
Huh?!

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.150
Lee!

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.990
Are you taking a break already?

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.500
Guy Sensei…

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.470
What is it that you want?

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.300
If it’s about my blunder with
the recent assignment,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.540
I believe I’ve apologized.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.210
Lee… It’s true you’re different from Neji.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.310
You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,
and you’re not a Taijutsu genius either…

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.980
But Lee...

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.150
you have powers
that exceed Neji…

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.660
you’re a genius with hidden potential.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.930
If you’re trying to make me feel better,
please stop!

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.130
Idiot!

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.430
I’m not trying to make you feel better
or anything!

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.570
The reason is that you are…

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.540
a genius of effort!

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.710
I wonder if…

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.050
If that’s true…?

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.150
I've…I’ve believed that to be true…

00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.020
That if I trained harder than Neji…
2 or 3 times as much…

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.030
that I’d surely become stronger.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:03.930
But...

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.870
I’ve recently begun to think that…

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.540
I can’t beat a real genius.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.510
Is effort really rewarded…?

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.540
I’ve wanted to know this and

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.280
so I’ve taken on Neji,
but it’s always been the same…!

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.550
I’m no match for him at all!

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.020
Even when I’m on a mission…

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.550
My legs still tremble even now…

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.390
I think that I’ll never become
stronger though I strive and strive…

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.400
I am so afraid that I can’t bear it!

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.570
What am I to do…?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.910
There’s no point in making the effort
if you don’t believe in yourself!

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.550
Lee, you’re very similar to me.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.050
Do you mean our eyebrows?

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.390
No, not just our eyebrows…

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.560
I was actually a failure once too…

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.560
You were, Sensei?

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.560
But now, I can even win against
the genius elite Kakashi,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.470
because of my efforts…

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.540
“I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.140
even though I can’t use Ninjutsu
and Genjutsu” you said.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.210
That’s your Ninja way, right?

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.250
That’s a fine goal…

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.150
It’s a fine goal worth sticking to!

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:40.420
That’s why you should believe in
your path and forge straight ahead!

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.200
Become a man powerful enough
so that I can just watch you smiling!

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.770
Understand, Lee?!

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.370
Yes!

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.850
Thank you…Guy Sensei…!

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.560
Stop, Lee!

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.230
If you fight any more, you’ll die!

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.940
Bushy Brows…

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.110
What?!

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.550
Movement has...

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.550
...returned to Lee!

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.650
Sensei is smiling and watching me…

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.560
And just because of that,
I can come back stronger!

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.430
Stronger… stronger still!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.600
Lee’s smiling…even though
he’s been driven into corner.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.970
No.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.540
It’s his turn to do the driving.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.540
Huh?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.640
The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.810
Blossoms twice…?

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.250
Lee said that too!

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.550
The Leaf’s Lotus blossoms twice.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:20.360
When we meet the next time,
I vow that I will be an even stronger man.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.690
No, Guy!

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.560
You haven’t?!

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.230
It’s exactly as you imagine.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.430
So that Genin…

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.740
that boy can open the Eight Inner Gates
in his body and use the Hidden Lotus…

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.540
The Hidden Lotus?

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.110
That’s right …

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.940
This is incredible…

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:42.850
Guy…

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:47.820
How many of the Eight Inner Gates
can that boy open now…?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.520
Five gates.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:52.220
What exactly is it?

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.560
These Eight Inner Gates and
that Hidden Lotus?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.560
The Eight Inner Gates are
“Limiter Releases”

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.570
used in preparations for
reaching the Hidden Lotus.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.570
A “Limiter Releases”?

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.540
That’s right …

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.980
In the Chakra Network
where chakra flows,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.010
there are eight places where the
chakra points are concentrated

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.210
in each area of the body from the
head area down--

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.250
the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,
Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.420
Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,
Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.390
These are called the Eight Inner Gates.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.360
These eight gates
continually “limit”

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.300
the amount of Chakra flowing
through the body…

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.170
However, the Lotus’s essence is to force
the boundaries of these “limits” to open…

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.710
and bring out several
tens of times the body’s strength.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.250
The Primary Lotus…

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.580
opens only the first gate,
the Gate of Opening,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.050
and releases the brains restraints

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.220
to bring forth a person’s muscles’ strength
to its fullest!

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.690
That’s the kind of technique it is.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.230
So…what is the Hidden Lotus?

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:15.210
After forcing the stamina to increase
at the second gate, the Gate of Rest…

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:19.010
From the third gate, the Gate of Life,
one enters the Hidden Lotus!

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.010
No way!

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.150
Even after using just the Primary Lotus,
his body was in shambles.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.250
So if he uses a technique beyond that…

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.520
That’s right.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.550
Huh?

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.050
By opening all the 8 gates,

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:37.030
one attains strength exceeding
even the Hokage, but in return…

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:38.930
one dies!

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.800
I don’t intend to pry into what that
boy means to you

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.440
or to tell you not to bring
your personal feelings into play…

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.340
But there is a limit!

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:51.540
I’ve misjudged you…Guy!

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.980
What do you know…about that boy?!

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.020
There is something important which

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.860
that boy wants to prove and
protect even if it costs him his life.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.560
I’d like to prove that I can become
a respectable Ninja

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.970
even though I can’t use
Ninjutsu and Genjutsu!

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.770
That would be the ultimate for me!

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.640
That’s why I…

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.770
wanted to make him a man
that could protect that thing.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.380
That’s all there is…

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.610
Lee!

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.980
I’m going to teach you
a new technique.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.550
Yippie, yeah!

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.020
– One that will be your trump card.
– Yeah, that's great!

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.590
Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.890
Lee, listen to my explanation
seriously, all right?!

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.260
Y-Yes, Sensei!

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.560
Let me first say that...

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.770
this is more of a forbidden Jutsu
than the Primary Lotus!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.770
And it will become the
most special technique for you.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.170
Special...?

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.940
However...

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:04.550
there is one strict condition
for using this technique.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.220
That is...

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.150
That is…

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:16.560
What?

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.700
I don’t know what
you’re planning to do…

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.570
But this is the end for you.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.800
That’s true…

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.610
In any case…
it will be the end with the next.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.580
Neji…

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.540
Sasuke…and…

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:42.690
There is no way that I alone
can lose in a place like this!

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.720
Guy Sensei…please allow this…!

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:49.960
It is now!

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.540
The time to carry through and
protect one’s own Way of the Ninja!

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.310
The Third Gate of Life…open!

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:25.600
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:34.170
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:43.750
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:52.060
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.630
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.870
You won't have to search around you

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.540
It’s all ok now.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:15.480
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:20.820
When you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.390
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.190
Just sing.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.560
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.770
The two are one

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:43.210
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:48.710
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.250
Effort is always rewarded.
My belief in this has brought me this far.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.520
Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto…

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.860
There’s no way that I can lose
in a place like this!

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.430
Even though this technique is
my ace in the hole,

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.070
I’ll show it especially to you!

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.100
This is my ultimate secret
Taijutsu technique!

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.910
Next Episode: “The Fifth Gate:
A Splendid Ninja is Born”

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.540
This is the end!
