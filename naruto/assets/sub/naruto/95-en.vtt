WEBVTT

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.380
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.880
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.500
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.090
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.500
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.500
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.170
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.000
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.300
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.670
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.960
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.550
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.130
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.630
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.250
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.840
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.550
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.960
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.340
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.250
As for me…
I stand by my words.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.880
That’s…my Way of Ninja!

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.130
If you die, there will be no dreams,
no nothing!

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.210
Just get out of the way!
Run away!

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.790
Just like our wager,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.790
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.790
I…

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.170
I will absolutely not die
until I’ve become Hokage!

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.790
This way, I can hold on to you.
Here I go!

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.630
I-It can’t be…

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.960
The Fifth Hokage!
A Life on the Line!

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.210
Rasengan!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.210
This is…?!

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.710
Way to go, Naruto.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.130
That Nine-Tailed Fox kid…

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.790
a kid like that,
doing a technique like that…

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.790
I-It can’t be…

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.500
He can’t be, really…

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.420
In only one week,
that Rasengan…

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.750
You… Even after you received
that Jutsu…?!

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.750
I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.670
and before I received the Jutsu
I had started healing.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.790
The reason why Orochimaru favors me…

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.420
is not because of my use of Jutsu
or my sense for Jutsu…

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.840
It is because my recuperative power.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.170
The power to energize cells
and make new cells.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.710
On the other hand…
I’ve used up almost all of my Chakra.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.380
That Jutsu…
seems it was Naruto’s last effort…

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.960
Wh-What?!

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.590
I-It can’t be…

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.790
Even with my powers of recuperation,
this much damage.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.790
I don’t…have…enough Chakra.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.000
Arrhythmia!

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.840
Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters…

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.130
Why did that happen…?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.460
That moment?!

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.710
At that moment of release…

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.420
did he shred the muscles
around his heart…?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.550
Stop shaking!

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.790
Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.790
Are we really getting a snack?
That guy looks like he’s going to die.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.590
You’re annoying! Be quiet!

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.420
It’s all over…for Naruto.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:45.090
I…cut…his heart’s Chakra Network
which restores the strength…

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.460
through the Nine-Tail’s Chakra…

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.790
With all my strength.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.880
In order to eliminate the possibility
that he would heal with his own power.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.170
There's no way he can recover…

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.840
Even with you.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.960
Shut up!

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.790
I’ll kill you later…

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.840
He’s stopped breathing…!

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Dammit!

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.050
Dammit!

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.790
Dammit!

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.880
It’s dark…

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.790
Dark…

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.250
Why is it getting dark?

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.710
My strength is… Why…?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.090
What…?

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.630
Don’t die…

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.670
Don’t die!

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.790
Don’t die!

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.790
Don’t die!

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.670
Don’t die!

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.800
The bet…

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.960
I won it.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.050
I-It’s impossible…

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.800
“Hokage is…my dream,” eh?

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.170
For the last time…

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.250
For the last time…

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.590
Just one more time…

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.800
I want to bet on you…

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.460
That child, he’s not well…

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.130
Tsunade is a medical specialist.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.790
Don’t worry, there’s no need to
worry about Naruto’s body.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.920
That’s not what I meant.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.170
What?

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:56.500
Your battle is with me,
there’s no time to look away.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.710
Who would have imagined this?

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.500
If that child is found by the Akatsuki,
there will be trouble.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.500
In other words,
if I'm to kill him…

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.550
now is the time!

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.790
Shoot!

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.960
He’s aiming at this child!

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.380
Tsunade… You’re the only one
I wasn’t going to kill…

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.420
If that child lives,

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.340
there will be trouble in the future
on a variety of levels.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.590
Don’t get in my way.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.460
This is one child…

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.750
This is one child…
I will absolutely protect!

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.550
Trembling at the sight of blood,
why would you, one of the Sannin,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.460
risk your life to protect that Genin kid?

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.050
To protect…

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.250
my hometown…the Leaf Village…!

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.500
To protect the Leaf Village…?

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.590
Because…because…

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.550
this small child…

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.210
is the kid who will become
Hokage some day…

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.380
What utter nonsense…

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.670
By the way…
to hell with Hokage!

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.590
Only a fool does that job.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.050
To hell with Hokage!
Only a fool does that job.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.710
The wishes of the two…

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.710
More importantly, Lady Tsunade,
your wish…

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.300
Have you forgotten your dream?

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.920
The successive lines of Hokage
have protected

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.420
the Leaf Village and
and those living in it.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.500
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.300
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.790
Anyone who makes fun of the old man
and the Fourth Hokage…

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.090
It doesn’t matter if
you are a woman!

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.500
I’ll clobber you with all my might!

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.750
And now,
I also will put my life on the line!

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.300
If your life is worth throwing away
for a kid like him… !

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.090
Then dying now would be
a fitting end!

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.550
All that’s left…is Naruto.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.590
Lady Tsunade!

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.340
Make it in time!

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.790
She’s still able to move even
after I pierced her down to her lungs!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.960
You mean you’ll still protect that kid?!

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.300
That’s what I said…

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.960
From now…

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.670
I’m putting my life on the line!

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.050
You, half-dead corpse!

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.790
No matter how cool you try to be,
your trembling doesn’t stop.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.210
You can’t get away from
the curse of hemophobia.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:50.130
And yet, why would you
take the blows for that kid?

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.790
Why would you battle for the Leaf?

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.800
No way!

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.250
Tsunade’s trembling has…

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.840
has stopped?

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.790
That is because…I am…

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.090
the Leaf Village’s…Fifth Hokage!

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:26.790
That sign is?!

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.790
Lady Tsunade has conquered
her fear of blood,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.090
but that’s…

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.790
What are you saying you’ll do,
after all this time?

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:45.790
You can’t fight with that wound
even if you’ve conquered your fear.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:57.500
W-Wait! I’ll treat that wound.
So don’t release that seal!

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.420
Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.130
Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.090
What is this Jutsu…?!

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.920
It looks like I’m not the only one
who develops new Jutsu.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.710
What in the world is this Jutsu?

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.130
Well…

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.920
For many years I’ve stored Chakra
in my forehead.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.340
The mass of Chakra stimulated
a variety of proteins.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.840
The number of times my cells divide
speeds to a dizzying rate…

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.250
The cells rebuild…

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.170
and all the organs and body systems
are revitalized.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:04.090
It’s not the ability to restore,
it’s the ability to reincarnate.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.300
That means I won’t die…from battles.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.790
But the number of times a person’s cells
divide in their lifetime is fixed…

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:20.050
If that is sped up,
it essentially shortens the life!

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.210
Lady Tsunade!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.840
That action is…

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:29.170
Lord Orochimaru!

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.550
Come out!

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.250
Hurry!

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:39.500
Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.590
– Summoning Jutsu!
– Summoning Jutsu!

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.790
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:28.170
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.340
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.960
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:43.710
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:48.460
That hold us together

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:58.090
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.790
you say laughingly

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.790
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.790
Like a comet,

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:17.790
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:24.960
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:35.420
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:44.250
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.340
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.590
The time to conclude this long, fateful
confrontation has come, Orochimaru.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.210
You have sunk too deeply into vice.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.790
You are no longer a comrade!

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.750
Comrade? How odious.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.210
That word makes me shiver.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.630
I will bring you down!

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.000
Today is the last day that
we are called Sannin!

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.790
Next time:
 "Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!"
