00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.990
A long time ago, a powerful demon fox
appeared with nine tails.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.990
With its powerful tails,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.120
it could smash mountains
and create tidal waves.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.580
A band of Ninjas rose to
defend their village from attack.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.620
We have to wait until
the Fourth Hokage gets here!

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.080
We can't let it get any closer
to our village!

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.660
One great Ninja was able to
imprison the monster,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.990
but died in the process.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.160
This Ninja was known as…
the Fourth Hokage.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.660
Naruto!

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.790
Why did you do such a thing?!

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.080
You're really gonna get it this time!

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.120
I don't care!

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.540
You know your problem?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.990
You can't do the things I do!

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990
Only I can do this!

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.370
I'm better than all of you!
Believe it!

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.990
There's a problem, sir!

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.830
Lord Hokage!

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.910
What is it?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.450
Did that Naruto do something again?

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.790
Yes. He climbed onto
the Mountainside Images…

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.990
And he vandalized and
graffitied all over them!

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.990
Wait!

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.080
Ha ha…

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.200
Why should I?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.120
Hey, Naruto!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.080
How did you suddenly get here,
lruka Sensei?

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.080
The question is what are you doing here
when you should be in class now?

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.250
Now listen, Naruto.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.990
You failed the last graduation test
and the one before that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.870
This is no time
to be goofing off, you fool!

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.990
We will have a re-test on
the Transformation Jutsu!

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.790
Even those who already passed
will take it!

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.990
Whaaaat?!

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.450
Sakura Haruno. Here I go…

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.120
Transform!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.990
OK!

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.870
I did it!

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.990
Cha!

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.200
Did you see that, Sasuke?

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990
Next, Sasuke Uchiha.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.870
Yes.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.540
O-OK.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.990
Next, Naruto Uzumaki.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.290
This is a real pain.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.990
And it's all your fault.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.370
Like I care!!

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.040
OK…

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.660
Good luck, Naruto…

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.990
Transform!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.120
How was it?

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.620
I call it the "Sexy Jutsu"!

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.910
You fool!
Stop making idiotic spells!

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.750
Darn…

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.410
Darn…

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.120
I won't let you go home
unless you clean that all up.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.120
I don't care…

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.830
There's nobody home anyway.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.370
Naruto...

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.580
What is it this time?

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.910
What I meant was…

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.990
If you clean up all that mess,
I'll buy you ramen tonight.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.250
Huh?!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.000
Yes!
I-I will finish it no time!

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.540
Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.790
Naruto.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.990
Why did you vandalize those faces?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.290
Don't you know who
the Hokage leaders are?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.200
Of course, I do!

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.080
I know they earned the title
Lord Hokage

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.910
because they were the best Ninja
of their time, right?

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:11.990
Especially the Fourth Hokage
was a hero

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.990
who saved the village from
the nine-tail demon fox.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.990
Then why did you do that?

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.450
Because I'll become a Hokage myself.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.990
And I'll be the greatest Hokage
of all time!

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.000
So that everyone will finally
learn to accept me!

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.330
By the way, Sensei,
I have a favor to ask.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.330
You want another bowl?

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.910
Mmmm…No…

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.500
Can I borrow that Leaf headband
for a while?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.080
This?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.790
No no!

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.990
This is worn only by those who
have graduated from Ninja Academy.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.990
Tomorrow, you will…

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.910
You're so mean!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.990
So that's why you took off
your goggles…

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.410
Humph...
One more bowl please!

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.580
We are now about to begin
the graduation test.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.040
When your name is called,
proceed to the next classroom.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.200
The test is on the Clone Jutsu.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.990
Oh no…

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.080
Of all the…! That is my weakest Jutsu!

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.580
But still…
I will do it no matter what!

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.160
Clone Jutsu!

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.830
Disqualified!

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.000
Iruka Sensei.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.990
His physical coordination
and stamina are excellent.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.660
And he managed to come up
with something.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.000
Isn't that enough
for him to pass?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.950
Mizuki Sensei...
All the others created three or more clones.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.080
Naruto created just one.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.000
And it's practically useless.
I can't give him a passing mark.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.370
I 'm a Ninja now!

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.700
You did well. That's my son.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.870
Congratulations for your graduation.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.660
I'll cook something good tonight!

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.620
Look at that one.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.040
It's that boy.
I hear he's the only one who failed.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.620
Serves him right.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.330
Imagine what would happen
if he became a Ninja.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.990
Isn't that the boy
who is actually…

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.580
Hey! We're not supposed to
talk about that.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:55.290
Iruka.
We need to talk later.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.790
Yes, sir.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.790
Iruka Sensei isn't trying
to be mean to you.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.830
Then why only me?

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.990
He wants you to become strong
from the bottom of his heart.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.540
You both don't have parents.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.080
But I really wanted to graduate.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.330
Heh... I guess I have no choice…

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.790
I'll let you in on a big secret.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.410
Secret?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.370
Iruka.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.450
What is it, Lord Hokage?

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.870
I know how you feel. But…

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.700
Naruto also grew up without knowing
the love of his parents…like you.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.990
Let me go!

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.580
My mom and dad are
still out there fighting!

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.830
Wake up, Iruka Sensei!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.450
What's the matter?

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.040
Come to Lord Hokage's immediately!

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.910
I heard that Naruto…
stole the Scroll of Sealing.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.540
The Scroll of Sealing?!

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.870
Let's see…

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:31.750
The first Jutsu is…
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.700
What?! Already a Jutsu I'm no good at?

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.950
Lord Hokage!
We can't forgive him!

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.990
This is not just a prank!

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.990
The Scroll is a dangerous item
that the First Hokage sealed!

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.950
Depending on its use…

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.990
It will be a major disaster if
it is taken out of the village!

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.370
Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.370
Yes, sir!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.500
Where did you go…Naruto?

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.790
I will tell everyone in the village
about this and eliminate Naruto…

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.250
Then the Scroll of Sealing
will be mine!

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.370
Hey you, Naruto!

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.990
You found me..

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.990
And I've only learned one Jutsu.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.160
He's been practicing the Jutsu…

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.500
until he's become
this exhausted and dirty…?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.910
Listen, listen!
I'm gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.990
You're gonna let me graduate
if I can do it!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.910
Isn't it true that I can graduate if
I can do one of the Jutsu written here?

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:08.990
Who told you that?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.990
Mizuki Sensei. He told me
about this scroll, and this place…

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.290
Mizuki did?!

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.330
I'm impressed you found this place.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.080
I see now…how it is.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.660
Naruto, give me that scroll.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.250
Wait, wait…
What's going on here?

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.250
Naruto! Never give him that scroll!

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.200
It is a dangerous object that contains
forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.990
Mizuki used you in order to
get it for himself!

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.500
W-Wha--?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.990
Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of
you holding that scroll!

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.990
Huh?

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.830
What are you saying, Mizuki!
Don't let him fool you, Naruto!

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.250
I will tell you the truth.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.660
Idiot! Don't do that!

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.370
After an incident 12 years ago,
a rule was created.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.250
A rule?

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.370
That is, Naruto, a rule everybody
but you knows.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.540
Except me?! 					What is it?

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.410
Stop it, Mizuki!

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.990
The rule forbids anyone from revealing
that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.370
Huh?

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.040
You are actually the Demon,
Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.120
who killed Iruka's parents and
destroyed our village!

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.540
Stop it!

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.080
Everyone has been
deceiving you ever since.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.370
Didn't you find it strange?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.000
Why everyone hated you so much?

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.120
No! No! No! No! No!

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.080
Naruto…

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.750
Nobody accepts you.
That's why Iruka hates you so much!

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.990
Iruka... Naruto grew up
without the love of parents.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.870
Everyone avoids him like
the plague after what happened.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.500
That's why he keeps misbehaving.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:33.370
It's the only way for him to get
any attention or acknowledgement.

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.990
He pretends to be tough,
but inside he is really hurting.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.040
Die, Naruto!

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.120
Naruto! 					Get down!

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.540
Why…?

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.080
Because you and I are the same.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.990
After my parents died,

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.990
nobody paid attention to me
or gave me any support.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.250
I wasn't a good student in school.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:19.990
I was the class clown…
because I wanted people to notice me.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.700
I couldn't get noticed through excellence,
so I kept doing stupid things.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.200
It was so hard.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.750
Isn't that right, Naruto?

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:41.660
You felt so lonely…right?
And you suffered inside, right?

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.750
I'm sorry, Naruto….

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:50.950
If I had been more responsible,
maybe you wouldn't have suffered so much.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.790
Don't make me laugh!

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.250
Iruka has always hated you,
ever since you killed his parents!

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.990
He's just saying all that
to get the Scroll of Sealing back!

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.160
Naruto!

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.990
Narutoooooo!

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.450
He is not the type of kid
who will change his mind.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.830
He will take revenge against
our village using that scroll!

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.990
Didn't you see his eyes?
Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.330
No…
Naruto…isn't…like that at all!

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.990
All I want is to kill Naruto
and get the scroll.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.200
I'll take care of you later!

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.370
I-I won't let you…

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.370
Well, well.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.990
Mizuki has a big mouth!

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.290
Naruto feels worse than he's ever felt.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.080
He might unleash
the power locked up inside him.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:07.080
The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.410
There's a slight chance
he might actually release

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.830
the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit
sealed inside him!

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.990
If that happens…

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.540
I've found him!

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.410
Naruto!

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.580
Everything that Mizuki said
was a lie!

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.790
Give me that scroll, quick!
Mizuki is after the scroll!

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.990
It can't be…

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.250
Why is it, Naruto?

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.120
How…

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.950
did you know I wasn't Iruka…?

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.870
Because I'm Iruka.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.700
I see.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.540
What's in it for you to protect
the one who killed your family?

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.250
I'm not gonna let a stupid idiot
like you get that scroll!

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.990
You're the idiot.
Naruto is the same as me.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.120
Same?

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.370
Anyone can do whatever
he wants once he has the scroll.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.580
There is no way that that monster…

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.080
that Fox Spirit, won't take advantage
of the power of that scroll!

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.200
You're right…

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.580
I guess it was true all along!

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:51.330
See, Iruka Sensei never really
cared for me at all!

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.500
...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.290
But Naruto is different!

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.620
I know that he is an exceptional student.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.990
He works very hard,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.120
and he's single-minded
and clumsy at the same time.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.290
No one accepts him, but he knows
the meaning of human suffering.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.990
He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.700
He's Naruto Uzumaki of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves!

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.660
You are so gullible. 					lruka!

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.250
I was gonna take you down later,
but I have changed my mind.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.040
Die!

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.290
I guess this is the end for me…

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.870
Naruto?!

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.500
You surprised me there, freak.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.120
If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei,
I'll kill you!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.330
Shut up! I can take care of a kid
like you with a single blow!

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.200
Why don't you try then?
I'll strike you back a thousand-fold!

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.250
Let's see you try!
Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.120
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.040
Naruto! You've…

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:30.910
Those aren't just images but actual clones!
That's an advanced Ninjutsu!

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.790
What's this…?

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.750
What's the matter? 					C'mon!

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.410
Weren't you gonna get me
with one blow? Here!

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.080
In that case…
I'll come to you.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.990
I kinda got carried away.
lruka Sensei, are you okay?

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:05.620
Yeah.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.830
He's really something.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.990
Maybe it is true.

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.000
Maybe he will surpass all
the Hokage leaders…

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.450
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.990
Has anyone found Naruto yet?

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.990
No.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.000
Darn, this is going to be bad…

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.250
There's no need to worry anymore.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.660
Lord Hokage!

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.200
He'll be back soon.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.870
Sensei, how much longer?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.450
OK, you may open your eyes now.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.870
Congratulations…on your graduation.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.620
In celebration, we'll have ramen tonight!

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.120
Iruka Sensei!

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.870
That hurts!

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.990
Naruto…

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.830
I was going to lecture to you...

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.330
that the road gets more difficult
now that you're a Ninja.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.040
But I guess I'll just wait to tell you
that until we get to the ramen stand…

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.410
W-What do you want, you little shrimp?
Quit following me!

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.290
You're smaller than me and

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.540
you're saying that you're gonna
become the Fifth Hokage?

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:20.790
I don't care if you are the 3rd Hokage's
grandson or not.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.330
It's not that easy to be a Hokage!

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.990
If you want it that bad,
you're gonna have to beat me first!

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.990
Next episode:
 "My Name Is Konohamaru!"

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.700
Watch my outstanding performance!
