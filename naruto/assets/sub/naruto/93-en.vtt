WEBVTT

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.350
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.890
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.480
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.060
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.480
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.480
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.150
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.980
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.270
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.650
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.940
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.520
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.230
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.890
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.520
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.940
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.310
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.890
How is that your answer…
Princess Tsunade?

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.690
To think you’d try to kill me…

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.890
At any rate,
I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.890
A trust for your loyalty and your eyes
that spotted Tsunade’s attack.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.190
Yes. We’re both from
the same medical corps so…

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.890
Her Chakra was overflowing
with violent intent.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.400
Tsunade… I was really planning
on resurrecting those two people.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.980
And here I went so far as to promise
not to smash the Leaf Village…

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.890
Orochimaru…

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.690
I know that your promise of
”not touching the village” was a lie…

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.940
Even though I knew that…I…

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.270
Just one more time
would’ve been fine…

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.900
Just one more time,
I wanted to see them…

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.270
Just one more time…
I wanted to touch them…

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.810
Just one more time…
To see those smiling faces…

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.060
But…

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.230
the moment I felt that
rush in my bones…

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.730
that I’d be able to see Nawaki
and Dan shortly…

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.810
I realized that I’m a hopeless fool!

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.560
Just by remembering those faces…

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.230
I become this blinded.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.810
Big sister!

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.730
Tsunade…

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.770
I loved them…
I truly loved them!

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.150
So, I wanted to see them
and hug them in my arms!

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.400
But…I couldn’t…

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.100
I won’t lose the bet,
no matter what!

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.890
Because of that kid…
I remembered the dreams of the two.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.940
Here I was trying to forget…

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.650
This village is grandfather’s treasure!

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.650
I’m going to protect it!

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.560
'Cuz I’m the grandson
of the First Hokage

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.890
who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.850
I love this village and my comrades…

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.690
So I want to protect them.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.890
Right! Someday,
I’ll become just like Grandfather.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.270
And the Hokage name will be mine!

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.600
Unlike you… I will be the heir to
the Hokage name, no matter what!

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.480
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.190
So I’ll become the Hokage…

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.850
An existence that protects everyone…

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.810
– Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
– Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.600
The precious dreams that
they risked their lives for…

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.730
Making those dreams come true
was also my desire…

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.310
Things that have formed
eventually decay… You said that.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.770
But…

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.730
after all, these are feelings
that won’t decay…

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.940
So our negotiations have broken down…
lt can’t be helped.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.230
Since it’s come to this, I have no choice
but to ask forcibly.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.940
Breakdown! The Deal is Off!

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.480
Come! Orochimaru!

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.890
Come to think of it,

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.440
we’ve never gone at it
even once until now.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:53.690
That’s right!

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.890
What’re you saying?

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.810
I’m the one who has
to go at it with her, right?

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.890
Now I’m going to kill
you two worthless punks…here!

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.810
Incredible strength as usual…

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.020
It’ll be over if you’re hit once.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.060
I can see that…

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:16.690
It’s a bit cramped here
for fighting at a distance.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.230
Are you going to change the location?

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.150
That would probably be better…

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.520
There was another troublesome person
with the Lady Tsunade’s attendant.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.480
That person may come
to her aid.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.100
You’re going down!

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.020
Who is…the troublesome person?

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.560
One of Sannin,
the same as you and Lady Tsunade…

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.400
Jiraiya!

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.480
I won’t let you get away,
no matter what!

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.890
Wh-What’s this?!

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:12.730
Huh… Princess Tsunade tore it up…
big time.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.890
This means that Lady Tsunade refused…

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.400
Where did old Tsunade go?

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.850
That belongs to Lady Tsunade…!

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.650
Tonton… Which way?

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:36.810
Okay!

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.850
It looks like you’re quite
out of breath, too… Tsunade.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.310
It’s just about time.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.900
I’m not that great at Taijutsu, but…

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.730
A Food Pill!

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.400
That Sign…!

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.890
This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu…

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:57.890
He got my muscle…!

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.890
I severed, ever so slightly,

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.940
the bicep muscle of your upper arm
and the rectus muscle of your thigh.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.190
Now you won’t be able to release
your incredible strength.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.890
A Chakra scalpel, eh…
Why don’t you target the arteries?

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.560
Indeed, with this scalpel,

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.890
I could cut the muscles and vessels
without external injury.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.060
But as may be expected,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.060
I can’t make a long, delicate scalpel
in the middle of battle

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.890
that can reach the arteries
and the heart muscle.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:28.890
But, even so…

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.730
there’d be no problem at all
if I target the opponent’s neck!

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.600
Dang it! My intercostals got hit.
My breathing…

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.980
He’s no ordinary Medical Ninja.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.890
His Jutsu sense and his edge
exceed even me in my heyday!

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.890
It would still be trouble
if you were to die on me.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.900
I won’t target your vital spot…

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.890
But with this, you can’t move anymore…

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.270
She’s amazing…

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.350
Ordinarily, one wouldn’t be able
to budge due to difficulty breathing.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.810
It looks like it will be necessary
to rough her up a little more…

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.810
but not enough to kill her.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.480
Even though I’m trying to move my hand…

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.890
my leg moves?!

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.560
D-Don’t tell me! This is…

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.890
You little!

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.730
In my present condition,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:07.890
this seems to be the extent of my power…

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.980
I see…

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:22.890
It’s… It’s not the muscles…
lt’s the nerves!

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.270
It seems you’ve realized…
That’s right. It’s the nerves!

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.890
I changed Chakra into electricity…

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.890
made an electrical field and
poured electricity into your nerves.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.100
The communication between
the brain and the body

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.150
is all done with electric signals…

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.850
Tsunade jumbled up all of
the electric signals that are exchanged

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.810
at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.810
Having left battle and yet such power…

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.020
So this is the legendary Sannin?

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.730
Healing-types use too much Chakra…

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.600
But in this condition…

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.890
If I try to move my right hand…

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.060
my left leg moves.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.810
If I try to move my left ankle…

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.270
my right shoulder moves.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:44.230
It’s difficult…

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.230
But I’ve already grasped eighty percent
of what moves when I move what.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.850
Don’t mess with me…

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.600
with this low-level…

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.350
Jutsu!

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.890
What?! In only a moment,
his body movements…

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.890
You’re scared of blood, aren’t you?!

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.270
I’ll show you plenty from now!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:35.890
Jiraiya…?

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.890
It’s been a long time… Jiraiya.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.060
Orochimaru…

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.890
You’ve got an evil look as usual.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.100
Huh?!

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.890
K-Kabuto?

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:00.890
Naruto…

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.270
I see… So you know each other?

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.890
We took the Chunin Exam together!

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.150
Why are you here, Kabuto…?

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.060
Get out of the way!

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.020
Hey…

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.400
I’ll take…

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.890
these guys!

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.890
Just because you’ve mastered
your body movements…

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.350
it doesn’t mean…

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.400
you can move like normal!

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:36.890
I won’t let you get away now!

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.890
Too late!

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.980
My body movements have
finally returned…

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.060
Blood…!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.810
Having two of the legendary Sannin
as opponents is hairy, isn’t it…?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.890
So even if it's just one…
I'll stop you!

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.980
Lady Tsunade!

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.980
Say! Say! What’s happening?!

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.890
Why’s Kabuto fighting
with old Tsunade?!

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.560
You’re slow, Naruto…

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.900
That’s why you’re no match for Sasuke.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.600
Take a good look at the headband!

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.940
He’s Orochimaru’s subordinate.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.440
Wha--?!

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.310
That’s right…

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.230
I was a spy from
the Village Hidden in the Sound.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.980
Wh-What’re you saying?

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.850
You’re lying, right, Kabuto?

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.350
During the Chunin Exam
you taught us a lot…

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.890
And you also saved us.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.690
Well, I wanted to gather data
on you guys.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.900
Naruto, there’s something
I understood by gathering your data.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.690
You have no Ninja ability.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.650
Unlike Sasuke!

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.770
It’s the first time
I’ve seen Lady Tsunade like this…

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.890
Please don’t push it too far alone.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.980
I’m your attendant, so…

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.150
Old Lady Tsunade…

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.480
Even with a fierce look,

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.890
you’re just a cute Genin
who’s a fish out of water.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.440
Admittedly, I was anticipating
the monster dwelling inside you…

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.690
But now,
with the legendary Sannin before me,

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.560
you leave something to be desired.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.020
You’re just a puny zero.
So if you meddle…

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.890
I’ll kill you.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.150
You little!

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:29.850
Don’t, Naruto!

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.310
My body’s still…

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:34.890
That hand…

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.810
He shouldn’t be able to use
that right hand anymore.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.100
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.230
I’ll attack at once with four…

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.440
and break him from the right side
where he can’t defend!

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.060
You little!

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.350
Okay!

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:57.690
What?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.230
Blood?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.890
Poison Needles!

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.940
My neural reflexes still haven’t
completely returned!

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.230
I can’t dodge completely!

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.520
With the headband…!

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.560
Good job, acting so quickly…

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.150
Thanks, Shizune!

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.890
That’s…

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.890
A Plasma Pill!

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.890
A Plasma Pill?

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.440
So he’s trying to replenish
lost blood, huh…

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.940
That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me…

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.230
The blood is gushing out nicely,
eh, Kabuto?

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.890
Lord Orochimaru…

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.150
Please take off the bandage
on your left arm.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.100
That man is Orochimaru…

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.270
At last, the real thing appears…

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400
Shizune!

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:39.980
Y-Yes!

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.230
You take care of…
that guy with the glasses!

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.060
I’ll take care of Orochimaru!

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:23.850
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.100
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.270
On your still shoulder

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.900
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:43.650
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.400
That hold us together

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:58.020
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.850
you say laughingly

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:06.810
but you look most dazzling

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.730
Like a comet,

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:17.890
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:24.900
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:35.350
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:44.190
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.270
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.940
Enough already, you traitor!

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.270
Don't you dare touch
Old Lady Tsunade again!

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.850
Hey Old Lady,
just like our wager

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.400
I will definitely win
that unlucky necklace from you!

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.980
I won't run away!
I won't give up!

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:11.060
Just watch.
This is my Way of Ninja!

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.100
Next time:
 "Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!"
