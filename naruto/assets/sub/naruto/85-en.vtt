WEBVTT

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.730
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.730
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.730
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.400
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.230
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:44.520
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.890
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.190
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.770
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.770
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.560
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.560
This man Jiraiya does not fall victim
to any woman’s allurement,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.100
but rather his forte is
winning women’s affections!

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.150
You were totally excited by a lame tactic
like a woman winking at you!

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.100
You shouldn’t be the one to try
acting all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.350
Like I said, don’t call me
that in front of people…

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.100
Be quiet…

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.150
More importantly these people
aren’t normal, Pervy Sage!

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.690
Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.230
Like I said, don’t call me “Pervy Sage”!

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.190
You are, after all, Master Jiraiya,
one of the legendary Sannin…

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.310
I didn’t believe that
I’d be able to stop you so easily

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.690
despite the fact that you are
a huge womanizer.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.560
What?!

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.190
You know the true identity
of Pervy Sage?!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.440
Well no, that’s not necessarily
who I really am…

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.100
Seems like you released the Genjutsu
that we had put on that woman.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.890
You shouldn’t call yourself a man
for using such a cowardly tactic

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.100
like casting a Genjutsu on the woman
with your hypnotic eyes

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.850
to separate me and Naruto.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.900
Separate us…
Why would they do that?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.890
Your target is Naruto, after all.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.400
You are after the Nine-Tailed Fox
in Naruto…

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.690
No wonder Kakashi knew that as well…

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.150
I see clearly now.
The information source was you.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.770
To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.270
What’s going on…?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.890
I can’t let you have Naruto…

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.350
I wonder about that.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.310
This is perfect…
I’ll get rid of you two right here!

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.890
Don’t butt in…

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.440
The one that’s going to kill him is …

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.190
Me!

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.560
Hate Among the Uchihas:
The Last of the Clan

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.810
Sasuke…

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.900
Revenge, I see…

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.020
Right now, I have no interest in you…

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.600
Don’t mess with me!

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560
Sasuke!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.890
Darn you!

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.980
Naruto! I told you not to butt in!

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.900
I told you before…

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.900
I’ve lived only for this very day…
for this very day!

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.940
Sasuke…

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:36.850
Not yet…

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.100
You can’t even make a hand sign
together at this point…

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.730
This is…my battle!

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.480
Fine.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.810
Wha--?

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.850
You heard that didn’t you?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.310
This is their battle.
Let’s not bother with it.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.020
Fine then!

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.690
Wh-Why…?

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.230
Our power difference hasn’t changed
at all since that time…

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.890
Why is that?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.690
He doesn’t show any mercy.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.690
What have I…
been doing all this time?

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.400
Whatever have I…

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.890
You are weak.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.940
And you are weak…

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.890
because you don’t have enough hate.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.400
This place is…

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.890
This place is…
Could it be?!

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.230
That's right.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.690
This is our house.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.190
Dad! Mom!

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.690
You are weak.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.480
For the next 24 hours…

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.190
Stop it…

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.400
Relive that day.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.730
Stop it!

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.230
Uncle! Auntie!

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.150
You’re not even worth killing.
Foolish younger brother…

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.650
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!
Hate me!

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.230
And keep on surviving in that
unsightly manner…

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.100
Just continue fleeing and fleeing
and hang onto your life!

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.980
Hasn’t changed at all…

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.890
Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realm
on your own little brother.

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.890
Stop it already! You!

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.810
Wha--?!

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.730
Th-This…

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.690
Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.980
How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.650
You guys are already inside
my stomach!

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.890
I summoned the esophagus of
the giant toad

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.480
of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.900
You guys are wanted criminals anyway.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.150
I’ll turn you guys into fodder
for the stone toad.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:01.890
What?!

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.060
Wh-What is this?

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.020
Naruto, you stay still!

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.190
Don’t worry, it’s my Jutsu!

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.900
Come here, Kisame!

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.350
Oh!

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.890
Darn it!

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.190
It’s useless!

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.810
There hasn’t been one person who
has been able to escape from this!

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.020
A wall of flesh is charging at us!

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.400
The wall is faster.

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:56.900
At this rate…

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.440
Hey…

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:10.890
Pervy Sage!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.230
What’s the matter?!

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.850
Huh!

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.940
They’ve gone!

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.600
I cannot believe that this wall
has been torn through…

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:36.940
Why must we retreat?
You would be…

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.400
We have no reason to rush to
get Naruto in the current condition.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.730
Besides, I have to rest
my body somewhere for a while.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.560
Not just Tsukuyomi,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.400
but he also made me
use Amaterasu as well…

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.440
What is this fire?

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.900
It’s black…

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.400
Don’t get so close!

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.940
How did those guys manage to get out?

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.310
Not only that…

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.560
What are these black flames?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:31.650
The stone toad who has the ability
to blow fire had its intestine’s burned…

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.730
Huh…?

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.890
All right!

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.310
Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.890
All right! It’ll be okay for now.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.890
Now for Sasuke!

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.850
Sasuke!

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.400
Sasuke…

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.440
Dynamic…

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:06.270
Guy?!

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.980
Entry!

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.730
Well… Eh…

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:24.350
I’m sorry to have kicked you so directly.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.850
I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror…

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.020
I used this headband instead,
but it was hard to see.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.230
And I assumed this rough-hewn face
was the enemy…

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.150
I just let the flames of
the burning juvenescence take over me…

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.480
I’m sorry!

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.150
Is that … supposed to be an apology?

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.940
I’m a simple-minded guy
just like how my face looks.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.400
It doesn’t really matter.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.980
More importantly, we have to get Sasuke
to the Medical Team!

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.890
Yes!

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.980
He’s broken his arm and ribs.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.100
Not only that, he’s lost consciousness

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.690
from some kind of mental blow
he received from the Visual Jutsu!

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.560
This boy also experienced that Jutsu…

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.150
Hey Pervy Sage!
ls Sasuke going to be all right?

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.850
Seems like he’s received
a significant amount of mental damage.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.060
I’m going to kill you!

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.190
Die!

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:57.730
You jerk!

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:58.440
You’re in the way!

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.890
Darn… Why?!

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.980
What did that guy do to Sasuke?!

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.770
Hey, Pervy Sage!

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.890
We’ve gotta change our plan!

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.100
I got scared earlier,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:38.270
but this time I’m going to chase
those black-capes and get them!

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.890
It’s me that they want, right?!

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.060
Then, I’ll be the one to
make my way over!

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.690
Humph, you’re only going to be killed
if you go now.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.600
They’re at a totally different level
from you.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.810
I just managed to get you
away from them…

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.350
Then, are we just going
to keep running away?!

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:08.230
Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.190
Shut your mouth for a second!

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.560
You are weak.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.730
I’m sorry, Guy.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.520
I thought that I had spared
the boy’s feeling, but…

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.150
I should have saved him much sooner.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.440
Kakashi has also come down
with the same Jutsu…

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.900
We don’t know when
he will regain consciousness.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.890
Kakashi Sensei?!

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.440
When my students are hurt…

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.310
I always wish,
from the bottom of my heart…

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.480
If that person,
who is a medical specialist, were here…

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.100
That’s why we’re going to
go find her now.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.440
What?

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.150
You mean, her?

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:34.890
Could it be…?

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.940
W-Wait…!

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.940
C-Could this money be…?!

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.850
Yup, that’s right…

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.890
The one who uses the slug
and drives illness away,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.560
and who is also
one of the Sannin like me…

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:06.350
All right! We’re going to turn around
our luck with this!

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:11.600
Princess Tsunade with
the letter “Gamble” on her back!

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:25.650
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.600
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:39.890
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.890
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.770
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:53.980
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.730
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.890
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.890
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:19.020
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.440
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.900
It’s festival, festival, festival!

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.890
I’m going to spend like
there’s no tomorrow!

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.980
Wait a minute, Naruto!
I will keep your wallet for you.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:55.850
Huh?!

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.190
It’s been said since ages past
that three forbidden factors:

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.940
money, alcohol, and women,
are believed to cause Ninja failures.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.770
I am not like you, Pervy Sage!

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.810
All right! I am going to
enjoy the festival!

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.190
Next time: “A New Training Begins:
I Will Be Strong!”

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.850
Wait. What are we gonna
do about my training?
