WEBVTT

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.590
C'mon!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.560
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.830
Being chased by something

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.240
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.910
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.650
For no single one,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.450
To none does belong,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.420
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.660
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.460
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.970
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.340
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.300
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.740
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.310
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.820
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.460
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.530
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.530
Rockin' my heart

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.440
I see. Sakura, you've come, too.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.850
Now you can formally register
 for the Chunin Exam.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.950
What do you mean?

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.050
Actually, from the start,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.460
only three-man squads could
apply and take the exams.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.460
But Sensei, you said that the decision
to take the exams

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.030
was up to the individual.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.330
Yes… I said that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.470
Were you lying?

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.870
Yes, I was…

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.440
If I said that,

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.280
Sasuke and Naruto would probably
forcefully convince you to take it.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.820
Even if you didn't have
the will to apply,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.120
if Sasuke asks you

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
you would attempt to take
the exams half-heartedly.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.130
For Sasuke's sake and,
well, Naruto's.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.460
Then, if…

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.000
it had only been Sasuke and
Naruto who had come here?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.370
I would've stopped the Exam here.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.440
I wouldn't have felt like letting
them go beyond this point.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.540
But…you guys came here
on your own will.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440
Sakura!

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.910
Naruto!

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.450
And, Sasuke!

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.950
I'm glad you came.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.420
You're a team I'm proud of.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.760
Now then, go on!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.460
Okay! Let's go!

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.160
Genin Takedown!
All Nine Rookies Face Off!

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.490
W-Wow!

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.030
W-What's with…this?

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.240
There are so many of them…

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.080
Could it be that they're all applicants?

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.920
They…all look…immensely strong…

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.460
Sasuke, you're late!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.760
I thought I'd be able to see you
for the first time in awhile,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.400
so I was waiting in excitement.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.640
Get away from Sasuke!
lno-Pig!

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.040
Oh, my. It's Sakura.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.040
Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh…
Ugly!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.540
What did you say?!

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.450
What's up with this?

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.220
Huh?

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.220
Are you guys going to take
this bothersome Exam, too?

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.320
Oh, it's the idiot trio.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.120
Quit calling us that!

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.360
Man, this is a freaking bother…

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.460
Shikamaru Nara.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.500
Always complaining,
has no motivation.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.330
He's a bellyaching idiot.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.340
Choji Akimichi.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.370
He's always eating something.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.440
That's all he is, a fat idiot.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.450
Sasuke…is mine. Bleah!

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.020
Ino Yamanaka.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.120
She's always fighting with Sakura.
She's her rival.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.850
A Sasuke-crazy idiot.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.460
Yahoo, I found you!

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.460
My my, everybody's here.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.630
H-Hello…

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.200
Oh…

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.530
Hinata Hyuga.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.700
She's a weird person who turns
her eyes away whenever I look at her!

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.440
She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.450
Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.110
They're louder than I am!

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.050
He always brings his dog and
always has a bossy look.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.290
He really annoys me!

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.220
Shino Aburame.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.460
As for this guy, I really don't get him!

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.530
He's a type I'm not good with.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.460
What did you say?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.270
You guys, too?! 					 Man.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.440
Ha! I see.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.370
This means all nine Genin rookies
are taking the Exam, eh…!

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:36.440
Now then…

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.740
How far can we go?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.440
Eh…Sasuke?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.450
Hmph!…

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.450
You're mighty confident. Kiba.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.250
We've trained a great deal, so...

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.120
We won't lose to you guys!

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.790
Shut up!

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.790
I don't know about Sasuke,
but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.630
I'm sorry. Naruto…

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.500
Kiba didn't mean it like that…

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.400
Huh?

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.970
Akamaru, you've become
tasty-looking…

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.440
What?

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.290
Don't step on it.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.220
Huh?

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.460
I said, don't step on it.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.460
You're…gonna eat that?

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.000
Hey, you guys!

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.770
You should be a little quieter.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:41.510
You guys are the "rookie nine" …
fresh out of the academy, right?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.410
Carrying on like that
with cute faces…Man.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.450
This isn't a field trip.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.280
Who're you? Acting all haughty!

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.450
I'm Kabuto Yakushi.
Anyway, take a good look around you.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.080
Behind you…
They're from the Rain Village.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.450
They're hot-tempered.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.250
Everyone's tense before the Exam.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.550
I thought I'd warn you guys
before you get your butts whipped…

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.620
I guess it can't be helped.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.630
You're rookies who don't know
left from right…

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.700
You remind me of my old self.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.700
You're Kabuto…right?

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.170
Yes…

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.440
Then, is this your second time?

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.710
No…

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.670
It's my seventh time.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.010
Huh?!

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.750
This Exam is only held twice a year,
so it's now my fourth year.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.250
Then that means you know
a lot about these exams?!

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.450
Kind of…

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.150
No kidding.
Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.460
But you haven't passed.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.430
Yeah, well, that is the case, yes…

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.630
Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.900
Man, this is utterly bothersome…

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.810
Then, maybe I'll give a bit of
information to my cute juniors.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.010
With these Ninja Info Cards.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.880
Ninja Info Cards…?

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.780
To put it simply,

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.750
they're cards that have information burned
into them and coded with Chakra.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.460
I spent four whole years gathering
information for this Exam.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.790
There are close to two hundred
of these cards.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.660
They are pure white to the eye…

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.830
To open the data on these cards...

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.040
What're you doing?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.300
The way it works is that
no one can see the info

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.910
without using my Chakra…

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.440
For example…Like this…

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.210
\Whoa, awesome!
What information is this?

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.450
The number of test-takers and
participating nations,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.450
and the number of applicants
from each respective village

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:12.260
is individually displayed.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.760
Why do you think that

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.130
the Chunin Exam is jointly
conducted in the first place?

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.440
It's said it's done to deepen
friendship among nations first

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.910
and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.010
"It's said"?

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.150
That's right.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.920
The real aim is in the checking of
Shinobi levels of neighboring nations

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.420
and keeping power balance equal.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.290
Power…Equal?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.900
Why such bothersome things?

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.170
If that's not done,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.440
the weak nations will be invaded by
the strong nations in no time at all

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.440
and may end up being
controlled unilaterally.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:07.280
There's a point to mutual supervision.
Probably.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.550
Hmph…

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.210
Of those cards,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.320
are there ones with
detailed individual information?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.950
Yes, there are…

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.420
Are there ones you're concerned about?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120
Yes, there are!

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.460
The information for the applicants
this time around is not perfect,

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.460
but is burned in and saved.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.670
You guys included…

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.000
About those "ones you're
concerned about," who you know.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.310
Anything's fine, tell me their information
and I'll retrieve it for you.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.450
Gaara of the Sand Village,
and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.210
Oh, you even know names.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.650
That makes it quick.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.800
Here they are!

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.460
Please show me.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.770
Here they are!

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.710
Please show me.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.490
I don't really get what's going on,
but I'll pretend like I do.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.860
Well then, first is Rock Lee.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.830
He's one year older than you guys.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.470
His mission experience,
twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.340
His squad leader is Guy…

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.540
In just this year, his Taijutsu
has drastically improved, but...

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.340
His other skills are not good at all.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.150
Last year, he'd attracted attention as
a Genin rookie with his ability,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.450
but didn't participate
in the Chunin Exam.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.760
This is his first time taking the exams,
same as you guys…

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.790
Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team…

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.030
Huh? Hyuga?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.570
Next…is Gaara of the Desert.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.150
His mission experience,
eight C-ranks. B-ranks…

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.950
Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh…

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.550
He's a Shinobi from a different land
and is a rookie,

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.450
so there is no further
detailed information.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.560
But…

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.630
It seems he has returned from
all of his missions uninjured.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.470
B-rank as a Genin…
But uninjured…?!

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.440
What is this guy?

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:01.450
Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,
Waterfall, Sound…

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.960
There are lots of exceptional Genins
from those villages

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.520
who have come to take
the Exam this year as well.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.860
As far as the Village Hidden
in Sound goes,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.870
it's a village of a small nation that
just sprang up in recent years,

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.830
so there isn't much information…

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.070
At any rate,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.440
they're all Hidden Villages
with nothing but crackerjacks.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.450
That kind of makes you lose
your confidence.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:31.110
Why are you saying that now?

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.280
In other words…

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.650
all of the applicants who
have gathered here…

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.090
That's right!

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.090
Not just Lee and Gaara,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.230
but they're all choice top elite
Genin from each nation.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:43.660
Hmm.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.660
This isn't going to be easy.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.340
I can't go along with this!

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.670
They may be your subordinates now,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.240
but they are children
who were my students.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.540
If it's about them I know…

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:00.180
It's as you say, Iruka.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.780
It's not going to be that easy.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.750
You're too eager.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.390
I postponed my team's test-taking
for one year

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.950
and took care to build up
their skills.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.290
Have them take the Exam after
they've enjoyed their life a little bit more.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.860
Hmph…

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.460
They might be too easygoing.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.470
But they will surpass
your guys in no time.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.570
That's enough.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.440
That's as far as
the rookie matter goes.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.340
Now then, next…

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.440
I'll take recommendations for Genin
other than rookies.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.450
Well! Don't pour cold water on this…

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.450
I said that, nevertheless…

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.420
I wonder if even the fearless ones
are frightened just this time around.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.460
Stubborn as he is,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.860
he's still consumed by this atmosphere
and number of people.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.160
He's tense.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.130
It can't be helped.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.870
Even though everyone is a Genin,
we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.280
I'm very, very uneasy.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.710
But…

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.710
It's kind of tough looking at
Naruto who's not himself.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.520
Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.590
Say…Naruto! Don't be so scared.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.460
Huh?

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.430
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.470
I won't lose to any of you!
Got it?!

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.450
Say! What's with him?!

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.510
That idiot would never
get depressed! Absurd!

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.320
It won't do any good to
provoke everyone!

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.450
Don't tell me!

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.420
If I don't tell it to you,
who do I tell it to?!

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:51.460
What did you say?!

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.260
Oh, I feel better.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.830
Hmph…

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.440
Isn't that the guy from before…?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.070
The dog's bark is
bigger than its bite.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:09.670
Is he an idiot…?

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.010
He's mighty high-spirited.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.480
He's hot-headed, eh.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.250
Lee, maybe you did
not bully him enough.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.450
Did you hear?

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.090
Sound Village is a minor
Hidden Village of a small nation.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.930
That's offensive.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.260
Maybe I'll…play with them a bit.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:37.530
Yes, being referred to as something
like leftover Shinobis and all.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.440
We'll add this to his data.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.610
Those Sound Shinobis
are brutal in their own way.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.720
I won't lose to any of you,
you say?

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.420
You said it…!

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.760
That idiot…

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.130
In no time at all, he's made enemies
of his surroundings.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.830
What're you talking big for?! You!

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.700
But, I just said what was true, I say!

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.440
E-Everyone, that was a joke.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.740
This guy's quite an idiot, you see…

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.610
After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,
scatterbrained things

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.450
and gets carried away,

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.820
so please don't concern
 yourself with him.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.450
Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.220
I'm going to kick your butt!

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:31.660
Shall we do it?

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.120
Let's do it.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.450
Learn how to read atmosphere
already, you!

00:18:59.080 --> 00:18:59.820
Fine!

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.460
These guys…are the Sound Village…

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.400
He dodged it!

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.440
I can see through that speed.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.790
I see… It's that kind of attack, eh?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.790
What's going on?

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.190
He was supposed to have evaded it.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:45.600
Why'd that happen to his glasses?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.060
Probably grazed the tip of his nose.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.670
He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.440
Huh?!

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.880
Oh! He puked?!

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.520
K-Kabuto?

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.780
Huh?!

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.660
Hah!

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.470
Hey, Kabuto!

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:23.470
Are you okay?!

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.440
Yeah…I'm okay.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.670
Really?

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.240
Oh, so he's not so special.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.240
Even though he's a veteran who's
been taking the exams for four whole years.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.750
Write this on your card.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.550
The three from Sound village…
Doubtless Chunin.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.820
Kabuto should've totally read the attack…

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.590
But why did he vomit?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.400
Lee. How about that technique just now?

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.640
I had no problem reading the speed.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.700
There's some kind of trick...

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.910
Silence! Degenerates!

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.660
Sorry to keep you waiting…I

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:29.400
I'm Ibiki Morino, proctor for the
first test of the Chunin Exam.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.400
It feels like the chance to show off
the fruits of our training has finally come.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.740
Well, no matter what kind
of test it is,

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.500
it's gonna be a snap!

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.010
I'm picturing Sasuke and them
bowing to me and saying,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.610
"Naruto, we're really no match for you."

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.610
Huh? Is this for real?!

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.620
Next episode: "Start Your Engines:
The Chunin Exam Begins!"

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.450
As for me,
 I'm going to kick butt once again!
