WEBVTT

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.290
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.190
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.260
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.060
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.510
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.120
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.690
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.690
It will come, closer

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.690
Now

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.040
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.470
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.310
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.750
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.480
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.820
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.230
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.230
Where is... this place...?

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.680
Who is it?

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.950
Me... 					from long ago?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.020
Father and mother didn’t need to die!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.000
Everyone was killed.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.430
I had no power so...

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.100
the clan vanished.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.360
Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.730
Ino... Why?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.940
I can’t let you upstage me
in front of Sasuke!

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.410
Squirming again...

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.880
The Leaf Village worms wandered in.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.480
What are the two of you thinking?!

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.690
They’re bad news!

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.720
It’s a pain, but it can’t be helped!

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.590
Ino steps out and
we men should run?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.700
Sorry to get you involved.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.000
But anyway we’re
a Three-Man Squad, after all.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.000
We’re all in this together, aren’t we?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.400
Well, we’ll see.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.770
No! I don’t want to die yet!

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.240
Let go of my scarf!

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.610
You’re annoying! Quit wiggling!

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.810
It’s okay for you to drop out, fatso.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.290
What did that guy just say?

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.690
I....didn’t quite catch it.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.690
Huh?!

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.890
That word is taboo to Choji.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.700
Try saying it again...

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.130
I said if you have a problem,
pull out, fatso.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.640
Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.640
I’m not fat, I’m just big-boned!
Blast it!

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.650
Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.820
W-Wow...

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.890
All right! You understand this, right?!

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.760
This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.360
Lucky! He’s lost it!

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.770
No way, this looks like it’s going
to be a pain in the butt.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.540
That’s my line.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.810
I was told to get Sasuke
by the end of the test...

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.480
Sasuke...

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.480
Sakura...

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.550
The two behind...
take care of them.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.020
Okay!

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.590
Well then, Team Ino,
let’s go full throttle!

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.760
Right!

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.100
Formation Ino!

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.700
– Shika! 					– Cho!

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.670
I’m counting on you, Choji

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.800
Okay!

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.040
Expansion Jutsu!

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.670
Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.480
Human Boulder!

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.690
What is this Jutsu?

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.950
Isn’t it just a fat guy rolling?

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.390
Slicing Sound Wave!

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.470
You!

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.680
He jumped?!

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.120
The air pressure of
Slicing Sound Wave

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.050
is less than effective
against that rotation.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.460
Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,
if I’m touched by something like that

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.560
the bones in my arms will be crushed!

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.700
Think I’ll let you?!

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.270
You’re the most annoying so...

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.670
Ninja Art!

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.240
Shadow Possession Jutsu!

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.140
My body!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.840
Huh?!

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.690
Dosu?!

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.690
What are you doing at a time like this?!

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.130
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.970
Ino, next it’s just the ladies.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.040
Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.070
Gotcha!

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.810
Huh?

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.780
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.220
Shoot!

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.760
Kin!

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.430
What happened?

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.040
This... is the end of it.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.310
You guys!

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.680
If you make one move,
 this girl named Kin is dead meat!

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.780
If you don’t want this
to end right here,

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.310
leave your scroll and walk away!

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.780
Once you’ve gone far enough that
I can’t feel your Chakras,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.120
I’ll release this girl!

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.660
These guys...
What are they grinning about?

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.260
– Choji! 					– Yeah!

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:03.190
This isn’t good! They won’t...!

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.470
Ino!

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.840
Uggghh. I’m dizzy.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.810
W-What kind of person...
hurts their own comrades?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.680
Careless.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:32.190
Our goal is not the scrolls or
to pass this test playing by the rules.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.230
What?

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.990
It’s Sasuke.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.440
Humph...

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.970
My Jutsu...

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.710
So your much precious
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.980
is limited to 5 minutes?

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.350
It’s not Shadow Paralysis.
lt’s Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.520
In addition, it seems that
this girl’s Jutsu...

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.090
seems to be a Jutsu to
take over the other’s body.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.590
From the looks of the blood
she’s spitting up,

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.260
if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.060
Are you going to do in...
your teammate?

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.930
If I need to...

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.910
This is no good.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.480
Shoot...

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.680
That’s too bad...
you’re just a step away.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.680
You’re too easy-going.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.620
Hmph, I don’t like this at all.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.060
You minor Sound Ninjas...

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.990
Bullying the second-rate guys and
putting on airs like a winner.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:44.090
What?!

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.670
They're Lee’s teammates...

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.140
Lee!

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.710
You goofed.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.580
Hah! Coming out of nowhere
like cockroaches...

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.020
That kid with the bob lying over there
is on our team, but...

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.890
But you messed with him, didn’t you?!.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.700
What’s with his eyes?

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.400
It’s like they see through everything...

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.570
If you’re gonna continue,
 I’ll fight with full strength!

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.670
Huh?

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:31.910
What ‘s wrong? Neji...

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.010
This Chakra...

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.980
If you don’t like me,
don’t play cool, come down here.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.290
No. Evidently, there’s no need for that.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680
After all...

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.310
without power...

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.680
I can’t do anything!

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.020
Because I had no power...
Everyone was killed!

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.230
No...
You let them be killed.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.600
You only... watched.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.300
If only I had power...

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.610
If only I had power...

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.290
Sasuke! You’re awake...
Huh?!

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.560
Huh?

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.930
That’s...

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800
Sasuke?

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.650
Sakura...

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.740
Sakura...

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.280
Who did this to you?

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.010
Who is it?

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.780
The Curse Marks run
around his entire body?!

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.860
Sasuke... 					That body...?

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.870
Don’t worry.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.640
On the contrary,
strength is rapidly flowing in...

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.240
Right now I feel good.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.980
That guy gave this to me.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:23.080
Huh?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.680
At last I understand...

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.650
I’m an Avenger...

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.220
On my road, I must put power
into my hands...

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.530
even if it means abandoning
myself to the devil.

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.600
So... I see...

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.640
So the mark on the neck
that this girl called Sakura spoke of

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.710
is this Curse Mark.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.680
But...

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.380
I didn’t think he could stand up...

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.780
Sakura, tell me...

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.650
Who harmed you...?

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.620
Me!

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.960
Huh?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.960
Ino!

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.600
If you stay like that
you’re gonna get involved!

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.360
Come back to this body!

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.730
Choji, you too,
come over here and hide.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.270
Y-Yeah.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.800
Uh-oh.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.670
Release!

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.210
Okay, she’s back!

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.640
Shikamaru!

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.980
What’s going to happen now?

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.650
How should I know?

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.830
Wha--?!

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.530
W-What’s this...?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.280
No matter...

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.780
how you look at it....

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.610
his Chakras are...

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.780
too big!

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.320
Dosu, this half-dead bastard
is nothing to be scared of!

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:12.890
Stop, Zaku! Don’t you understand?!

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.860
I’ll take care of all of them...

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:17.730
in one fell swoop!

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.700
Super Sonic Slicing Wave!

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.120
Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.650
– Who did? 					– Huh?!

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.960
Zaku!

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:51.830
He’s fast!

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.700
Moreover, he took in those two,
and in the blink of an eye.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:59.800
Fire Style!

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.270
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:03.240
Don’t push your luck!

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.780
I’ll blow them off!

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.680
What?!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.680
Shuriken’s in the fire?!

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.620
Zaku, below you!

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.700
The quality of the Chakra
 is completely different...

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.770
Is that really Sasuke?

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.670
What happened?
What in the world...?

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.280
It seems like you’re
proud of your arms...

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.580
You!

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.380
S-Stop it!

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.520
Sasuke will definitely come for me.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.510
You’re the only one left.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.380
You...

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.690
make it a little more fun for me.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.560
This isn’t...

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.240
This isn’t...

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.580
This is not like...

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.980
Sasuke!

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:58.690
S-Stop!!

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.960
Stop it.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.610
Please...

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.110
Stop.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.630
The Curse Mark is withdrawing...

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:43.900
We’re saved for now.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:45.670
Sasuke!

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.310
You’re strong.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.690
Sasuke... We can’t defeat you
the way you are now.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.160
This is our fee for settling this...

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.760
Please let us withdraw from here.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.690
Huh?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.570
It seems selfish, but we now have
something we need to confirm, too.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.010
That being said,
let’s make a promise.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.350
If there’s another opportunity to
battle with you in this test,

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.380
we won’t run or hide.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:39.860
Wait!

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.960
Who in the world is Orochimaru?

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.760
What did he do to Sasuke?!

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.700
Why Sasuke?!

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.700
I don’t know...

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.570
We were just given orders to
make the hit on Sasuke.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.110
Though you ordered us to
assassinate Sasuke,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.050
you got to him first.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.220
Moreover, you didn’t kill him,
and left that Curse Mark instead.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.020
I don’t know what you’re thinking...

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.570
Hey! Are you okay?!

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.570
It’s a pain, but Ino,
I’ll leave Lee to you.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:30.240
Got it.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.710
That Chakra...
lt’s abnormal.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.520
The Uchiha clan...
this good, huh?

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.690
Sakura’s in danger!

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.690
It’s okay...
I’ll protect Sakura.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.390
Well, what should we do
with this guy?

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.690
Kick him awake?

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.700
Can I do it?

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.970
What am I...?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.670
Sasuke...

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.030
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:32.440
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:42.110
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:50.490
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.960
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.260
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.800
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:13.680
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:19.050
when you want to cry, and you want to run away

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.650
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.590
Just sing.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.860
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.200
The two are one

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:41.640
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:47.140
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.250
Hey, what’s up Akamaru?

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.450
Wait a minute, Naruto,
he’s acting strange.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.690
What, are you hungry?

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.560
Doesn't seem like it.
How about a walk?

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.930
I know. You’re looking for
an electric pole, aren’t you?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.100
He bit me!

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.300
Next pisode: “Akamaru Trembles:
Gaara’s Cruel Strength!”

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.610
What in the world do
you want, anyway?
