WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.190
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.090
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.960
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.450
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.020
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.410
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.720
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.720
The waves of pain are coming faster...

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.920
Sasuke, you should quit
the preliminaries!

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.890
Huh?!

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.590
L-Look, you haven't been yourself

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.460
ever since you got worked over
by that Orochimaru guy!

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.970
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.530
To think it’d be so soon…?!

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.910
I couldn’t ask for more.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.140
For the 1st battle,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.810
Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchiha
have been selected.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.050
No objections, right?

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.220
- Right!
-No!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.520
The pain won’t go away!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.560
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.560
Don’t use the Sharingan.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.270
So you knew?

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.540
If that Curse Mark on
your neck gets out of control,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.770
it could endanger your life.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.770
I believe it.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.110
Well, the match will be
called off at that time.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.350
I’ll be coming in to stop it,
so good luck.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.650
Called off, you say?!

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.860
It seems this Curse Mark thing
is responding to my Chakra.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.530
In other words, in this match,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.800
I can hardly use even
my regular Jutsu,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.570
not to mention the Sharingan!

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.610
However… Yoroi’s ability is
the worst for you, Sasuke.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.650
Now then, please begin.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.570
You… my Chakra…

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.540
You just noticed now…?

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.310
Bushy-Brow's Jealousy -
Lions Barrage Unleashed!

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.710
You… my Chakra…

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.980
You just noticed now…?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.760
Yes…Yoroi has unorthodox ability
to absorb Chakra.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.530
It’s a magnificent art that
absorbs spiritual and physical energy

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.630
simply by holding his palm against
an opponent’s body.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.840
And, if all of your Chakra
is absorbed, Sasuke,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.680
you’ll be forced to rely upon
the power of my Curse Mark…

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.690
Now, release that luscious power…!

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.360
That is the only way
you have to survive.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.860
You…little!

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.570
To think you still have strength left…

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.140
Though you’re just a guinea pig.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.710
That was a close one…

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.050
Put your mind at ease…
I’ll end this right away!

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.230
What’s the matter, what’s the matter?!

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.640
You already finished?!

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.210
His aim is one, close-quarter fight.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.150
What should I do!?

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.350
At this rate, things will go downhill…

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.860
Sasuke Uchiha…
ls this the best you can do?

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:20.590
Sasuke…

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.870
Sasuke!

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.740
You call yourself an Uchiha with that?

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.010
Don’t be looking so lame!

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.340
Give your best!

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.510
That guy…

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.550
That’s it!

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.390
Oh!

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.960
You can’t afford to be inattentive!

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.560
I’ll finish you with this!

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.540
Is this as far as it goes…?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.720
He…vanished?!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.560
That’s my…!

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.060
What?!

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.360
Huh?

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.740
But then…from here on is my original.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.910
It’s over…

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.380
The Dancing Leaf Shadow…?!

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.010
Eat this!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.190
Dang it…!
lt’s responding every time…

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680
Please…!

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.550
I’m begging you…

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.550
Stop!

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.730
You! Sasuke!
Don’t be looking so lame!

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.640
To think they’d be worried about me…

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.540
Is this it…?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.710
I won’t be swallowed up…
by this thing...

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.010
No way!

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.890
The Curse Mark receded!?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.560
Here I go!

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800
You’re weak!

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:21.670
You’re weak.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.550
I’m not done, yet!

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.760
Lions Barrage!

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.090
There’s no need to check.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.540
I’m stopping the match from
going any further…

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.880
Therefore, the winner of the
first battle, Sasuke Uchiha…

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:39.920
passes the preliminaries!

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.820
Yes!

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.600
Well. Good job…

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.840
Before that Lions Barrage,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.810
your movements were that
of Guy’s Taijutsu…

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.650
So you copied it with the Sharingan

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.490
when you wrangled that one time
with that Lee kid?

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.760
Sasuke! You, you…

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.000
won in a lame way!

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.570
Look at you, all battered up!
You idiot!

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.540
Man, that loser…

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:37.510
Sasuke…Thank goodness.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.380
Okay, I’ll win, too!

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.350
Lee… Because of you,
 I’ve managed to save my neck.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.320
Things would’ve gotten hairy

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.090
if I hadn’t seen your technique
in close-quarters combat.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.000
But it doesn’t appear to be a technique
that I can use heavily.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.540
I see… So before, he copied a part
of the technique I only used once?

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.350
Sharingan!

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.920
That’s your ability…

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.420
Sasuke… you’re quite a person.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.960
You get rapidly stronger…

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.400
I kind of…feel a bit of fear.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.940
For a sequence of
high-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.970
it’s impossible to acquire this
without training

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.840
that whittles away flesh and blood.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.510
No matter how much you
use the Sharingan,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.550
it can’t just be mastered in
a short space of time…

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.980
Moreover, his idea for that
finishing move…

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:01.560
Kakashi… this boy reminds me
of when you were a kid…

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.070
Last year’s number one rookie
was Neji Hyuga.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.900
This year’s number one rookie
is Sasuke Uchiha.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.140
I wonder which one is stronger…?

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.710
Really, he’s something else.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.150
To think he’d develop the true power
of the Sharingan in situation like this…

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.720
What’s most to be feared…
is the Uchiha ability?

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.460
That was surprising…

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.100
To think he brought the Curse Mark
that was getting out of control

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.970
into submission with his will…

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.840
Tsk. Again?

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.850
It just make it more interesting!

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.550
Yeah! He is Sasuke after all…

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.990
This is as far as we’ll go…

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.460
I’m hungry…

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.360
W-Wow!

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.190
Nothing special.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.670
Magnificent…

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.670
Sasuke Uchiha...

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.080
We medics will give you
the best of treatment.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.850
You guys are out of your territory.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:30.680
Huh?!

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.050
I’ll take him under my care…

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.820
Now, I’ll take you into the back…

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.820
and seal the Curse Mark.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.960
Can we wait until
the preliminaries are over?!

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.630
I want to watch the matches
of those who will remain in the main battle.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.060
No!

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.500
Don’t get so heated.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:49.970
If we let things be
any further,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.540
the situation might become irrevocable.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.470
I won’t accommodate you anymore.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.940
Now then, come on…

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:04.680
Sasuke…

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.560
Hm?

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.850
Sakura... Speaking of which,
during the match…

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.550
did you see something that looked
like a strange wound on Sasuke’s neck?

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.190
What?

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.130
Please promise me…

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.900
Don’t say anything about
this bruise to Naruto.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.700
What?

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.900
Listen… this is also teamwork.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.540
It won’t do to have him
unnecessarily worried.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.210
I-I don’t know either.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.140
I see…

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.120
Umm, now then…

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.720
We will get right to it and
begin the second match.

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.540
Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.510
Which weakling is it?!

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.760
Both of you, come forward.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:00.560
We will now begin the second match.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.900
That’s the Sound Ninja…

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.140
The guy who had both
his arms broken by Sasuke!

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.950
It seems like you’re proud
of your arms…

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.420
You!

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.150
S-Stop it!

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.900
He’s going to fight with those arms?

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.740
I wonder if Shino is going to be okay…

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.940
He’s fine. He’s strong!

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:42.710
What…?

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.540
I’d square off with anybody except him…

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.550
Now then, please begin.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.980
Now, Zaku…

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.550
How you fight will be a sight to see…

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.580
If you fight here,
you’ll be finished…

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.480
Withdraw!

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.580
Somehow, this one still works, so…

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.230
One arm is enough to take care of you!

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.270
You can’t beat me with
just one arm.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.970
Stop pestering me!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Take this!

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.310
Slicing Sound Wave!

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.880
Okay.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.450
Hang in there.
lt’ll be over right away.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.060
Curse Sealing!

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.190
Next time, even if that Curse Mark
starts kicking in again…

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.330
the power of this Curse Sealing
should suppress it.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:25.540
However, this Sealing Jutsu makes
the strength of your will its foundation.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.710
If something happens like
you not believing in your own strength

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.210
and that will were to weaken…

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.110
the Curse Mark will
once again start to rage.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.550
Out of character.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.320
It appears he’s quite tired…

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.820
To think you’ve become able to
handle Sealing Jutsu…

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.360
You’ve grown, eh, Kakashi…?

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.240
You…

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.550
Long time no see, Kakashi.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.550
Orochimaru…

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.130
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:32.400
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:41.880
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:50.250
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:57.190
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.060
You won't have to search around you

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.600
It’s all ok now.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:13.540
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.020
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:23.550
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.390
Just sing.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.630
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.960
The two are one

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:41.440
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.940
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.350
This is surprising.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.550
I never thought you’d appear.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.560
Why are you after Sasuke?
What’s your purpose?!

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.060
Even though you’re one of
the legendary three Ninja,

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.560
I must not retreat.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.730
I’ll stop you here,
even if it costs my life!

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.170
Next episode: “Kakashi and Orochimaru:
Face-to-Face!”

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.540
Well, it’s sink or swim.
