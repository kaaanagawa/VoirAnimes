WEBVTT

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.590
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.090
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.710
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.300
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.710
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.710
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.380
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.210
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.500
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.790
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.170
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.750
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.340
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.790
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.460
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.750
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.340
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.550
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.130
Well then, Guy.
I’ll leave Sasuke to you.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.500
Master Jiraiya…

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.420
Hmm?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.210
Be sure to find Mistress Tsunade
and bring her back to…

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.960
You bet we'll find her
and bring her right away!

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.790
Naruto! I like kids with guts like you!
I'm going to give this to you!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
This made Lee stronger…

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.880
Huh?! What ?! What?!

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.670
This is it!

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.920
Wow!

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.090
They're breathable and
moisture-wicking,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.590
and perfectly designed for free movement,
all in a beautiful, stylish package.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.920
You'll notice a difference immediately
if you train with them on!

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.090
They're going to grow on you!

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.670
Before long, you'll be wanting to
wear them all the time like Lee!

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.000
Of course, I have a thing for them, too!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.880
Woooow!

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.250
Why couldn’t you bring a mirror
or something

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.380
instead of carrying around
those things, you dork!

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.880
Do you think they'll look good on me?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.090
Don't even think about it.
Get a load of that…

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.550
Now that is truly dorky.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Okay! This is the place!

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.210
Here?!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.800
The gambling house frequented
by the entire town…

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.750
Your target is Naruto, after all.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:23.050
To abduct Naruto is the No.1 priority
placed by our organization, Akatsuki!

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.630
What's wrong?

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.340
Pervy Sage… Why are they after me?

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.000
You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?
Tell me why…

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.790
They're not really after you…
They're after what's inside of you.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.380
What on earth is this thing?

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.210
It's a horrible demon that
attacked Leaf Village, right?

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.710
And was dreaded by all.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.880
So why do they want it so much?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880
Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Fox
is a demon

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.380
that appears at each critical juncture
throughout the ages

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.880
destroying everything in its path…

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.340
And people feared it like
an act of nature.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.300
The reason they want that thing…
for what purpose.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.460
Honestly, I can't quite say.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Just that now that Nine-Tailed Fox
is sealed up inside of you…

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.630
they might be thinking
they want that power in their control.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.130
It must be harsh to know

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.630
that Ninja like them
would keep coming after you…

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.790
But well, that's your destiny!

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.210
Now don’t you worry,
I'm going to protect--

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.790
Then there's nothing to do
but hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.090
Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.590
have her save Sasuke
and get down to some serious training!

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.790
That's just like this kid…

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.380
A New Training Begins:
I Will Be Strong!

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.090
Th-This place has the highest antes…!

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.500
Don't go fretting over
every little thing!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.630
Let's go!

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.960
Oh dear! Please wait!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.790
Hmm?

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.090
What?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.590
The beautiful woman you
want to "research" on…

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.790
That's this Tsunade person?

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.790
Whoa! That’s sharp coming from you!
And what about it?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.340
She's part of the Sannin thing
like you, right, Pervy Sage?

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.590
Yes, and what of it?

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.500
How…old is she?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.790
My age.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.130
Heck, she's an old lady.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.920
Yikes!

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.550
Huh?!

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.170
Th-This woman is…!

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.750
Would you mind changing all
of this money into chips for me?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.920
Oh no! She's really going for it!

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.300
Just who is this? This lady…

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.300
You don't know?

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.380
She's that woman with
the famous alias…

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.550
Famous alias…?

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.500
So, well…what kind of person
is this Tsunade like?

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.790
Oh, you want to know?

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.630
Yeah.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.130
Let's see…

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.420
Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.750
Besides that, she's a diehard gambler
and her face is known far and wide for it.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.790
Then we should have no problems
finding her!

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.630
If she's that famous!

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.750
She's famous, all right…
Legendary, you might say…

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:41.420
Boss, what's this alias…?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.090
The Legendary…

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.920
Legendary…?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.790
Oh dear! They're all laughing!

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.550
– Legendary… 					– Legendary…

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.790
Sitting Duck!

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.630
Yup! But no matter how famous
Legendary Sitting Duck is,

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.090
I doubt we'll find her right away.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.800
Why not?!

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.210
She hates growing old so much

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.630
she's probably used some special Jutsu
to change her appearance.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.790
She's actually 50 years old,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.210
but no doubt she looks like
she did when she was 20…

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.960
And not just that,
recently I heard that…

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.880
she transforms into her teens or
30s or 40s as the situation calls for

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.550
to escape moneylenders.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.380
What?! That's a horrible thing to do!

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.790
Tsunade has always loved
to gamble more than anything

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.210
But she has terrible luck and no skill.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.960
She was always being played
for the Sitting Duck and the name stuck…

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.380
Then she was always borrowing money
and skipping out on her debts, too…

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.170
Ah, it brings back memories.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.590
This is no time to be
getting all nostalgic!

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.790
Tell me, how do you propose
we go about finding her?!

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.460
Well…

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.300
We may very well have to
put our noses to the ground,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.340
but we're not without our little tricks.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.670
What?! So you have no idea
how long it's gong to take?!

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.790
We won't be wasting any time.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.630
All of our time on the road
will be your time.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.790
My time?

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.790
Time to make you strong…
Training!

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.130
Okay!

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.750
No, no… I told you that is definitely out.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.750
I won't be seen walking with someone
dressed like that.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.710
Come on, Pervy Sage!
Let's hurry up and start training!

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.000
Now now, don't get ahead of yourself…

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.790
The training won't mean anything

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.840
unless it's done in the process of
gathering information on Tsunade.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.960
Huh? Gathering information…?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.050
In this town.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.550
Wow!

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.790
Cool! This is my first time
for this kind of thing!

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.790
Down time is important, too!

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.790
You go have yourself some fun
before we start training.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.420
The festival should continue
for some time.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.790
We'll stay here in this city
for the duration.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.840
We'll train here, too!

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.710
All right!

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.840
Whoa! That's a fat wallet!
You're rich!

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.170
I have quite a bit!

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.550
I've saved it little by little
throughout my missions.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.170
Well then!

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.880
– Wait! Naruto! 					– Huh?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.460
I'll hold on to your wallet for you!

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.710
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.500
You can spend this much…

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.590
What?! Only 300 ryo!

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.050
No complaints!

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.420
Remember Shinobi must honor
the " Shinobi’s Three Taboos"!

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.790
Shinobi’s Three Taboos…?
What's that?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.840
What?! You don't know!

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.790
The "three taboos" are
the three temptations

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.590
that will bring Shinobi to ruin!

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.550
The three temptations are
booze, women and money…

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.300
Oh, then this doesn't really apply
to me all that much!

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:03.170
I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!
I don't quite get the women thing!

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.170
And I worked so hard
to save all that money,

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.840
I don't really feel much like using it…

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.460
You fool! Don't you underestimate
the desire for money!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.380
Once you start using it,
it goes really fast!

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.340
Money has a frightful power.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.710
This Tsunade we are going
to be looking for

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.130
has ruined herself over it!

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.790
Your desire for women is always
 getting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.750
I'm going on
an information-gathering mission!

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.790
Here, you hold on to my bag for me!

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.300
If you get lost,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.880
my tracking SummonsToad
will follow my scent!

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.340
He's really just a child after all,
contrary to appearances…

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.000
Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.130
I’ll take one order of
octopus dumplings, sir!

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.790
Right!

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.460
– Potatoes with butter please!
– You got it!

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.050
– I want chocolate bananas.
– Right!

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.750
– I want apricot candy!
– Thank you!

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:12.130
– I want okonomiyaki too!
– Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.170
One extra-large order
of fried noodle, sir!

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.550
Right…But my you've got
a lot of food there, young man!

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.130
You don't plan
to eat it all yourself now, do you?!

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.750
Eh? As a matter of fact,
I am gong to eat it all myself.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.500
Oh, um, here you go…

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.250
I think I ate a bit too much.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.670
I wonder how everyone is?

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.790
Kakashi Sensei… Sasuke… Sakura…

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.670
I'm going to train hard every day
and come back stronger.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.800
Just you wait and see!

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.790
But before that…
I better work off that meal!

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.420
Last one!

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.670
– All right! Perfect!
– Oh! Amazing!

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.500
That's the fruit of hard training
throwing shuriken.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.250
You stink, sonny!

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.000
Hah! Gosh darn it!
Well, just watch this!

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.880
Hold it!

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.790
Huh?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.090
Attention: Shinobi!
Ninjutsu strictly forbidden!

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.790
Thanks now!

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.550
You shouldn't try to walk around
with the mask on.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.790
It's Pervy Sage’s bank saving book.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.800
One, ten, one hundred…

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.300
L-Look at all those zeros!

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:03.790
He should be treating me now and then
if he has this much money.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.790
Stingy old geezer!

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.090
There's only a little left… .
One more stand and that will be it…

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.500
Time to make you strong…
Training!

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:32.590
Two grilled squids please, sir!
Make one of those an adult size!

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.590
Okay! Someone sent you
to buy some squid, eh?!

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.960
I'll throw in a child size for free!
Coming right up!

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.000
Hurray for you, sir!
You're a man among men!

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.000
Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!
I'll give you the adult one for half price!

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.500
Thanks!

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.670
Good grief, where did he go to?!

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.880
Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.790
Young ladies are so nice.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.790
Oh, Naruto! You've already had
you're fill of the festival?

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:20.380
Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.790
You're breaking all three at once!
You bastard!

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.790
W-Wait, Naruto…

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.210
N-No, I won't wait!

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.710
You used all my hard-saved money!

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.790
– Take this and this and this!
– N-Naruto, stop!

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.630
I'll pay it all back!
I'm sorry, p-please!

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.250
You! You!
You made my froggy wallet all flat!

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.130
Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.920
You stained Leader's designer suit!
You'll have to pay for it!

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.790
Fork over 100,000 ryo!

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.500
What?! You're telling me
that suit cost 100,000 ryo?!

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.050
Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.960
to say a dorky suit like that
cost 100,000 ryo.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.000
Are you asking for it?!

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.170
You better put a lid on it
if you know what's good for you.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.380
The leader used be a Chunin from
the Hidden Village of Stones,

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.340
the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.960
Come again? Legendary what?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.960
You seem to want to get hurt!

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Naruto.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.050
Perfect timing.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.920
I'll show you a Jutsu now…
Watch very carefully!

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.170
Now you've done it!

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.710
A-Amazing!

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.630
I was holding back quite a bit…
You guys are so weak.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.790
A-Are you? The…legendary…

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.590
I'm sorry…
We kind of destroyed your stand…

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.340
H-Here… Fix it with this.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:07.710
Oh! Thanks.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.790
Would you mind if I bought all
your balloons and water balloons

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.210
at the same time, my man?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.790
Fine by me…

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.250
That wasn’t an ordinary hand move…

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.340
What in blazes was that?!
That Jutsu!

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.790
Naruto!

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.960
Come with me! It’s training time!

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:30.960
Yes, sir!

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.670
Finally, the mood is right
for a little training.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.790
– Here! Water balloon!
– Wha--?

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:47.550
Eh?! What is it for?!

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.130
You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.710
Y-Yeah.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.130
What Jutsu did it look like to you?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.210
It looked like you made
your opponent spin violently.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.790
His perspective's off…
But I guess that's to be expected.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.790
Right, okay… Yes, spinning!

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.800
He's spinning the water in the balloon
without moving his hand?!

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.090
Whoa!

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.000
The tree-climbing exercise

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.790
to learn to gather and
maintain Chakra in necessary places…

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.130
The Walk-on-Water exercise

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.250
to learn how to release
a set amount of Chakra…

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.000
You did both of these, right?

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.790
And now with this water balloon exercise,

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.710
you'll learn how to create
a stream of Chakra…

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.790
In other words, spinning.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.050
Create a stream of Chakra…

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.790
I'll give a more detailed explanation
of the Jutsu

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:43.420
once you get these first steps down.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.340
First, you must gather
and maintain Chakra in your hand

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.790
using the tree-climbing technique.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.920
Then you must continuously
release Chakra

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.840
using the Walk-on-Water technique.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:57.790
Then you push and churn the water
in the balloon with the Chakra!

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.800
I get it!

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.750
Then you spin the water
in the balloon faster and faster

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.960
until the balloon pops!

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:08.750
You're catching on
more and more quickly!

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.590
Okay, today we're going
to train until evening!

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.590
Yes, sir!

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.750
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.710
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:39.800
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.880
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.790
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:54.090
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:59.790
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.880
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.840
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:19.130
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:24.550
Over and over,
we've seen fools

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.250
I will break this water balloon
no matter what!

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.790
Hey, you're full of spirit!

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.880
Perhaps I can expect him
to master the Jutsu.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.750
The water inside the balloon
is moving.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.790
By the way, when does that pop?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.670
Next time: “Keep on Training:
Pop Goes the Water Balloon!”

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.250
Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!
