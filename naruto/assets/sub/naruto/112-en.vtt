WEBVTT

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.940
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.850
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.150
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.310
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.480
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.020
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.900
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.020
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.190
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.890
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.890
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.520
Byakugan!

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.810
Caught ’em!

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.560
All right! All right!
I’ll drag Sasuke back without fail!

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.890
Naruto! Hate to tell you this,

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.150
but I’m gonna demonstrate
my new Jutsu right here!

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.270
Me, too!

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690
Don’t be so hasty.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.980
As soon as preparations have been made
to implement my strategy…

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.270
we’ll make direct contact
with the target!

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.560
It looks like they haven’t
noticed us yet.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.890
Huh? Sasuke isn’t there.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.440
It appears that…

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.060
he’s inside that “coffin.”

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.890
What’s this?

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.770
I poked the bush for kicks

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.350
and out comes not even a snake,
but just two bugs.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.270
Hey, wait a minute! Wait!

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.650
We didn’t come here to fight.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.730
We just came here to negotiate!

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.480
Huh, then…

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.190
What are they?!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.890
There’s no point
to that Smoke Bomb.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.350
You can’t run away from me.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.100
It’s string that's thinner and stronger
than wire that you can hardly see.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.060
My string is placed all over this place.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.890
Darn.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.270
Those two types of wires
on the trap were on purpose…

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.980
It was actually a triple trap.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.690
Darn.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.600
Didn’t think they had one
with such ability in the group…

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.650
You will be…!

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.730
What’s going on...? My body…

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.890
Nice! Kiba, Shikamaru!

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.400
Shadow Possession Jutsu succeeded!

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.940
But… There is one with
ability like this, too.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.400
Thanks for getting caught so nicely
in my strategy.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.060
Darn… But...

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.810
I have this kind of ability, too.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.100
Where did it come from?

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.020
Earth Style Barrier!

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.650
Earth Dome Prison!

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.810
Squad Mutiny: Everything Falls Apart!

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.270
Darn!

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.310
Where is this?

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.650
Inside of that big guy’s barrier.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.850
Darn!

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.520
These guys are mine.
I want to recover as much as possible.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.900
Once you’re done eating,
catch up with us,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.480
we’re going ahead.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.270
Come quickly.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.060
Let us out! You!

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.020
Be quiet, Naruto!

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.150
From the looks of it,
it just looks like a dirt wall…

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.650
It’s their Jutsu,
there must be some kind of trap.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.690
I don’t know what it’s made of,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.890
but we’re just going to
have to tear this wall down!

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.940
Even though
it’s dangerous to be careless,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.310
actually it’s more dangerous
to remain silent here.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.600
Tunneling Fang!

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.890
The wall is restoring itself…

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.600
Hey…

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:14.890
I saw that.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.650
Let us out!

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.650
It’s not just a dirt wall, after all.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.890
Byakugan!

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:05.890
Th-This is…

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.560
What is it ? What’s happening?

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.190
This is bad.
Chakra’s getting sucked up…

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:41.520
Darn… I didn’t expect that
they would just keep us in the barrier,

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.850
but I didn’t predict that
they would suck our Chakra either.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.190
Man. How dare they!
Let us out of here already!

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.730
I’ve had a good amount of Chakra.
Thank you for the meal.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:48.730
I feel like my body energy
is being sucked out.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.400
It won’t be good if
we stay like this here, Shikamaru.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.810
It was careless to get caught

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.850
before we even figured out
our enemy’s powers.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.350
On top of all that…inside here.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:20.100
Darn! I’m going to make an air hole
before all my Chakra is gone!

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.480
Akamaru!

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:24.940
The Food Pills!

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.890
Akamaru!
Human Mimicry Ninja Art!

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.890
And for me,
Beast Mimicry Ninja Art!

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.230
Fang Over Fang!

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.310
All right! Good going, Kiba.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.060
It’s useless…

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.520
Darn! It starts to restore
the moment it’s hit.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.890
Same with the ground.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.850
At this rate, we won’t be able to
keep up for another ten minutes.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.730
We’ll lose all our Chakra
and be totally annihilated…

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.900
I can’t use the Rasengan that
requires extremely difficult Chakra control

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.890
especially in a place like this
that sucks the Chakra out of us.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.400
Darn!

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.060
Hey, I want you to listen to me!
I want to talk to your leader.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.480
We won’t go after Sasuke anymore,
so let us out of here!

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.560
Hey…

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.400
Shikamaru, what are you saying?

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.770
Pleading for your life,
how interesting…

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.650
But you guys are my prey,
I can’t let you out.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.600
Then…just let me out on my own.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.100
This battle…

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.890
is such a pain.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.890
You! Do you know
what you’re saying?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.890
Shut up, Kiba, be quiet…

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.440
What?!

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.100
A split in the group, huh?

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.890
Seems like you’re the leader, but…

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.150
I didn’t think you would be
the only one begging for your life!

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.900
You really see a human’s true nature
when one is pushed to the edge of death.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.520
You’re such a low-life creature,

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.890
you’re not qualified to be responsible
for the lives of your platoon members.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.060
I’ve saved the most
important thing for last…

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:49.060
To abandon Sasuke and
to even sell out on your own platoon…

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.440
Is that what it means
to be a Chunin of the Leaf?

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.560
Sasuke is a Shinobi of
the Village Hidden in the Leaves.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.890
He is a comrade!

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.600
Therefore, I will put my life on the line
to help him!

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.560
That's the way of the Leaf Village.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.100
Someone like you deserves to die…
I won’t let you out.

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:11.520
Shikamaru! I believed in you,
but now I’ve lost confidence in you!

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.850
Let’s take this outside!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.600
Hey, we can’t get out!
You fool!

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.600
That’s why we’re in this situation!

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.230
What do you mean by "fool"?

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.520
I’m just speaking the truth, fool!

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.980
Oh! You said "fool" again!

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.850
Everybody, be quiet for a second!

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.150
Choji?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.890
Now he’s squatting down.
What is he thinking?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.890
Hey! Why are you eating snacks
all of a sudden?!

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.890
Choji binge eats when he gets upset…

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.890
Geez, another useless guy.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.890
It can’t be helped!
ln this case, Shadow Clone…!

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:04.890
Stop it.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.900
The enemy’s Chakra is placed
all over that wall.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.600
Even if you are able to scratch it,
the wall will restore itself right away.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.900
In other words, it’s useless
unless we can attack it

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.190
with a Taijutsu that has enough power
to destroy this wall with one blow.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.890
Somebody that has a Taijutsu
with greater destructive power than mine

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.190
would be Choji, but…

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.770
At this rate…

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.890
Darn, what do we do!

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.440
Neji… I’m sorry, but can you use
the rest of the Chakra you have

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.890
to observe the wall behind you
and the wall behind Choji?

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:52.440
I got it.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.900
Shikamaru! You be quiet!

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.890
Naruto!

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.650
You still don’t understand?!

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.060
Remember what Shikamaru said
when he gathered everyone!

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.440
Even I can't just sit back
and be a sluggard.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.270
Because I'm responsible
for your lives.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.810
Choji, don’t raise your voice
too much from here.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.650
Kiba, dent that wall
behind Neji and Choji again!

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.520
Y-Yeah…

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.890
Huh! I don’t fully understand
what’s going on,

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.230
but I’ll go wild one more time!

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.730
Tunneling Fang!

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.810
Huh! No matter how hard you try,
it’s useless!

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.980
Huh, I see…

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.310
It’s over there.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.480
Neji!

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.890
Mark that spot with the Kunai Knife.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.850
Choji, are you ready?!

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.400
Okay! Any time!

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.890
All right, let’s do this.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.060
What’s happening?!

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:30.520
Like I said earlier,
the wall’s surface is planted with Chakra.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.730
But even this tough wall could have
an area that have a thin layer of Chakra.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.020
That is what Shikamaru speculated.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.600
How…How did you get all of that?

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.440
Think about what happened earlier.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.890
Because he noticed that
there were areas that restored quickly

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.890
and others that didn’t so quickly

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:57.900
when Kiba and Akamaru attacked
the wall surface.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.310
In other words, he guessed that
those areas that didn’t restore quickly

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.900
probably has a thin layer
of Chakra.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.890
On top of all that,
by cleverly talking to the enemy,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:18.900
he figured out the position
of the enemy outside of the wall.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.100
He guessed that
the wall furthest from the enemy

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.730
probably had the thinnest point
of Chakra,

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.150
so that’s what he wanted to confirm.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.190
That’s what it is, correct?

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.890
I see, in order to trick the enemy,
you must trick your friends first.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.890
I didn’t see that there was
such a plan behind that conversation.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.230
Then, Choji realized the plan

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.600
and the reason why he was eating
was to replenish his Chakra.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.650
These two…

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.650
They haven’t been working together
as a team all these years for nothing.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.890
I’m depending on you, Choji.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.730
Yeah!

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.890
Expansion Jutsu!

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.060
All right, let’s go!

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.690
Human Boulder!

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.940
What?!

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:10.940
Choji… You are awesome, after all!

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:32.230
Once in a long while, once in a while

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.890
The remnants of a person
broken by dreams

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.150
Look like a mountain

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:53.520
Clinging to the Divine,
clinging to Buddha

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:59.020
The remnants of a person crying

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.060
Look like a mountain

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.890
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.810
This is my victory pose, round and around
 (round around)

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.900
Shake shake shake
Let’s look

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.150
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:33.480
Look like a mountain

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.730
Look like a mountain

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.230
Look like a mountain

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.520
Look like a mountain

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.850
Huh? What are you saying
all of a sudden, Choji!

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.690
There’s no way that’s possible!

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.100
But, Choji is right.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.350
If we keep lagging, we won’t be able
to catch up with Sasuke.

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.310
But still…

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.270
Don’t worry. I have an idea.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.690
Choji, are you possibly thinking…

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.230
Do you have a plan or something?

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:04.850
Yeah.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.690
Hey! Choji!

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.890
That’s right!
I have that secret weapon of mine!

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.480
Next time:
“Full Throttle Power! Choji Ablaze!”

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.270
I’m the one who will defeat that guy!
