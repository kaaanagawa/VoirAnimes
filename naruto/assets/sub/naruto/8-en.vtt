WEBVTT

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.820
C'mon!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.860
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.130
Being chased by something

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.540
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.480
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.150
For no single one,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.820
To none does belong,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.590
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.130
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.900
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.400
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.770
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.740
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.210
Tearing through the dark

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.780
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.290
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.860
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.000
Rockin' my heart

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.670
Such intensity...

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.310
If I take a breath or move my eyes
I will be marked and killed –

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.810
that's what I'm feeling..

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.820
If I'm stuck like this for an hour,
I'll go mad.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.660
Facing a Jonin intent to kill…

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.830
This sensation is like having
my life held in limbo...

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.270
No way! I'd rather die
to escape this feeling!

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:38.800
Sasuke...

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.710
Don't worry. I'll protect
you all with my life.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.180
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.620
I don't know about that...

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.700
It's over.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.830
Sensei! Behind you!!

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.240
Die!!

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.480
The Water Clone Jutsu...?

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.820
It can't be.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.420
Don't move!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The Oath of Pain

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:30.820
It's over.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.690
W-Wow!!

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.200
Did you say it's over?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.800
You don't understand, do you?

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.740
You won't be able to beat me
just by making like a monkey…

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.780
No chance.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.320
But, I must say you're good.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.860
My Water Clone Jutsu was
being copied at that point…

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.830
I absolutely won't allow
my comrades to get killed.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.800
By letting the clone talk as if it were you,
you succeeded in distracting me.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.740
And you used Hidden Mist Jutsu
to hide yourself to see what I was doing…

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.310
But…

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.820
I'm not a fool.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.620
That one was a fake too!

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.070
Now!

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.580
Makibishi spikes…!

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.510
How foolish...!

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.820
Sensei!

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.020
Oh, I can't believe that
Kakashi Sensei got …

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.120
kicked away like that….

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.130
His Taijutsu skills are also
extremely good.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.430
W-What's with this water...?
lt's awfully heavy.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.800
Humph... Fool!

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.910
It's the Water Prison Jutsu!

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.270
Darn it.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.450
My temporary escape
into the water…

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.510
was a huge mistake!

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.820
You're caught…

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.790
It's a special prison that makes
it impossible for you to escape!

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.460
It makes things harder
having you able to act.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.390
Now…Kakashi.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.400
I'll have to settle things
with you later.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.800
First, I will finish those guys off.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.240
Water Clone Jutsu…

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.210
Didn't expect this level of skill…

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.820
You're acting big,
wearing a headband like a Ninja…

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.360
But…a real Ninja is one

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.060
who has hovered between
life and death numerous times.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.000
In other words,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.500
only those who are worth being listed
in my Bingo Book

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.740
deserve to be called Ninja.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.810
Guys like you can't be
called real Ninja.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:48.810
He's disappeared again!

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.830
You're just a kid!

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.830
Naruto!

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.700
You three! Take Tazuna and run!

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.530
You have no chance
against this guy!

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.700
As long as he has me trapped
in this Water Prison,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.070
he won't be able
to move from here.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.340
And he shouldn't be able to use
the Water Clone Jutsu

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.610
if he's far enough away
from his real body.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.780
In any case, just run for now!

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.950
Run away?

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.880
You've got to be kidding me.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.490
That option was gone
from the moment you got caught.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.920
Even if we ran,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.730
without you, sooner or later
we'd be defeated by Zabuza…

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.530
and we'd all be destroyed.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.670
Even if we were to reform
the Manji defense,

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.070
it would be impossible
to block his attacks.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.440
In the end…

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.270
we'll have...

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.240
no options left.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:56.750
In order for us to survive,
our only option is to rescue you.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.820
We'll just have to do it!

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.900
There…!

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.830
Too easy.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.610
Sasuke!

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.750
Sasuke…

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.820
T-This is the Jonin level…
A real Ninja…

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.820
We've got to run…
At this rate…

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.360
Seriously…! Seriously…!

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.490
We'll be killed!!

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.750
I'm going to swear on
the pain of my left hand!

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.020
I'll never get into another situation
from which I'll have to be rescued…

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.730
I'll never be afraid or
be a coward.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:21.870
Are you hurt…scaredy cat?

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.200
I won't lose to Sasuke.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.450
Can I borrow that
Leaf headband for a while?

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:41.950
This?

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:48.330
This is worn only by those who have
graduated from Ninja Academy.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.860
Naruto, come over here.
I'd like to give you something.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.740
Congratulations on your graduation.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.170
That's because you're
all squirts

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.910
who don't have the qualifications
to become Ninjas.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.450
Missions are all risky assignments.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.820
You pass!

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.820
I'm not that little prankster
that you think I am!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.120
I'm going to surpass the Hokage!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.690
And so I'm going to get
the entire Village

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.860
to acknowledge my existence!

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.230
That's right…

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.240
I am a Ninja now. And...

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.840
I decided that I was not going
to run anymore!

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.240
That I wouldn't run away…!

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.820
Y-You fool! Stop it!

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.820
Oh, Naruto! What are you thinking?!

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.090
Humph! Fool...

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.070
What are you thinking…
charging off on your own?!

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.040
Even Sasuke is no match for him…

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.610
No matter how hard we try,
we Genin are no match for him…

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:23.290
Huh...?!

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.660
The headband….?!

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.650
Hey! You, with no brows...

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.350
Record in your Bingo Book…

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.020
about the man who will one day
become the Leaf Village's Hokage.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.830
Leaf-style Ninja…

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.570
Naruto Uzumaki!!

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.540
Naruto…

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:25.280
When I first saw that little kid,
he seemed so unreliable…

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.690
Sasuke! Lend me your ear!

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.520
What is it?

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.160
I have a plan.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.130
You want to discuss plans
under these circumstances…?

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:36.390
This guy...!

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.830
Humph!
You are talking of teamwork?

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.570
W-What is this feeling…?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.100
Was Naruto so…?

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.740
Now...

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.340
Let's get wild…

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.980
Now, let's get wild!

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.820
Such loud snorting,
but do you have a winning plan?

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.530
T-This isn't good…

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.460
What are you guys doing!
I told you to run!

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.060
It was obvious what was going to happen
once I was caught!

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.170
Hurry! Run!

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.200
Listen to me!
Our mission is to protect Tazuna!

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.070
Have you forgotten that?!

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:59.040
Old man….

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.680
Well...

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.150
This is a seed that I planted…

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.990
I can't say that
I want my life to be spared.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.360
Sorry, you guys…

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.830
Fight as much as you want!

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.830
You hear that?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.700
Are you ready?

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.010
You guys really haven't learned
anything, have you?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.880
W-What?!

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.150
You're still playing at being Ninja?

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.020
When I was your age,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.830
this hand was already
stained red with blood!

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.030
Zabuza, the Demon!

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.800
Ohh…? It seems that
you've heard of me.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:05.380
A long time ago, in the Mist Village,
often called the town of Blood Mist,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.980
Ninja candidates faced
their biggest hurdle.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.820
So you also know about
that graduation exam…

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.290
That graduation exam?

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.490
What is it...?

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.630
This graduation exam
that you're talking about...

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.800
The students killed each other.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.800
What….?

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.240
Classmates who had shared rice
from the same pot

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.750
formed pairs and tried
to kill each other.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.820
It didn't end
until one of them died.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:53.690
Partners who used to talk about
each other's dreams and aspirations…

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.890
How cruel…

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.830
Ten years ago,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.800
the Mist Village's graduation exam
was forced to undergo drastic reform.

00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:11.410
That was because an evil demon
had appeared on the scene the previous year.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.950
Reform?

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.150
What about the reform?

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.120
What had that evil demon done?

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.830
With no scruples or hesitation…

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.930
a young boy who didn't even have
the qualifications for being a Ninja,

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.400
annihilated over a hundred examinees.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.620
That sure was…fun…

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.270
Sasuke!

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.120
Die!

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.820
Darn!

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.990
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:44.000
Ah... Shadow Clone Jutsu,
and there are quite a few of them.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.830
Here I go!

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.010
It's impossible, after all…

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.820
There is no way that
you can defeat the guy!

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.160
There is only one way left
to defeat this guy!

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.830
Sasuke!

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.000
I see!

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.200
So that's your plan, Naruto!

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.900
That's pretty good for you!

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.480
Demon Wind Shuriken,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.920
Windmill of Shadows…

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.960
A Shuriken won't work on me.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.950
I see. This time
it's aiming for my real body…

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.820
But...

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:44.250
It's not so easy!

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.460
A Shuriken in
the Shuriken's shadow...!

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.830
This is...
The Shadow Shuriken Jutsu!

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.070
A second Shuriken
in his blind spot!

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.110
But...

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.820
Still too naïve...

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.280
He dodged it!!

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.330
Here it is!

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.670
Yes! The plan worked!!

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.570
That Zabuza had no clue
as to what I was thinking,

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.840
and I fooled him!

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.810
Ninja must be able
to see through the obvious.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.810
Did you see that – the Leaf-style fighting
of Naruto Uzumaki?!

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.480
Kakashi Sensei,
the rest is up to you.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.790
Next episode:
 "Kakashi, Sharingan Warrior!"

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.720
I'm going to kick butt once again!
