WEBVTT

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.870
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:18.120
Even if you get lost, let’s start walking

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.410
One more time

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.120
Are you really happy

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.660
when you're always meeting
to someone's expectations?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.370
Even if you change to
who you really wanna be

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.040
Will you always have a great smile?

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.660
Dreaming of only “the beginning,”
I wake up

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:54.910
and someday, I'll live on my own.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.990
Yes, precious things are never in shape

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.990
You never know what it is
when you get it or lose it

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.120
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness,
your uniqueness into strength

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.990
Even if you get lost,
let's start walking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.990
One more time

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.290
The winner is Temari.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.080
Oh, I’m tired…

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.910
Oh, what a waste!

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.160
Why?! He had a chance to
become a Chunin!

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.910
Shikamaru is Shikamaru…

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.500
Really… Does he or doesn't he
have the motivation?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.790
Even I’m not sure about it.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.990
But his intelligence and strategies
are no longer at the Genin level.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.160
If it had been an actual mission
for a basic platoon,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.580
the win was decided when
he captured Temari…

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.410
So, I suppose he won the competition,
but he lost the match…

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.750
It’s unfortunate he shows no
signs of being motivated,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.330
on the other hand, he won’t get too
emotional or fall into a panic.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.990
And that’s exactly why…

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.540
he’d be able to calmly pull back if
he viewed a situation as totally hopeless.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.620
That could be attributed to
calm judgment.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.200
Shikamaru probably possesses…

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:25.990
the most important psychological
element required for a Chunin…

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.330
the disposition of a leader!

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.910
In order to evaluate someone
as a leader of a platoon…

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.700
it’s much more important to
protect the platoon from danger,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.580
than to carry out a mission.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.040
Yeah…it’d hardly be worth mentioning
a completed mission

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.750
if everyone was annihilated.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.410
The risks and the mission
should be put on a scale,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.950
surviving should be thought of first,
and then action should be taken.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.990
A person who can’t do this isn’t
qualified to become a Chunin.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.410
Hyuga and Naruto from earlier
fail on that point.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.160
Although they are all right
as insignificant Genin.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.120
Well, I do feel like Shikamaru
gave up too soon too.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.870
What do you think?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.790
What do I feel…?

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.000
He has more of a chance
than Naruto, for sure!

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.080
Shoot…!

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.290
Why the heck did he give up!

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.750
Is he an idiot?!

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.750
This ticks me off!

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.870
I’m gonna really give him
a lecture!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.410
So the one that’s gonna
become a Chunin is…

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.160
You idiot!

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.540
Shut up, super idiot!

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.580
Why the heck did you give up?!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.990
Let’s not talk about that anymore,
all right?

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.990
It’s not all right! It was a match
you were close to winning!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.990
– Let's just watch the next match.
– But you just gave up! Unimaginable!

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.990
Simply unimaginable!

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.990
Huh? The next match?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.990
Sasuke…!

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.790
"Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.870
At last, Uchiha’s match is next.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.200
Oh, but who’s this opponent Gaara?

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.120
I wonder…

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.330
But compared to Uchiha,
he’s nothing much.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.120
Do you know?

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.160
I hear Uchiha’s gonna
withdraw from this match.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.540
Really?!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.250
Yeah, he apparently sustained a serious
injury while training before the match…

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.990
Are you serious?

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.120
And to think I took time off
specifically to see this match!

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.540
I’m counting on you, come on!

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.620
As you’d expect, this match
will be won by Uchiha.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.620
No way, I’ve got high hope
for the new one of the Sand.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.250
He won’t let this one slip by.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.080
As they say about the world
of competition…

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.990
It’s impossible to predict
what will occur…

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.990
Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.370
he has not yet arrived at the arena.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.080
Umm…it’s unavoidable…

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.750
We can’t make the guests
wait any longer.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.620
Another ten minutes.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.910
Why don’t we wait just
another ten minutes?

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.990
But…

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.500
The guests are looking forward
to the next match above all else.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.990
Cancelling it would be cruel.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.450
Since it’s come to this,
waiting another ten minutes wouldn’t hurt.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.290
Lord Hokage…?

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.750
Umm…

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.040
Uchiha, where are you!

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.950
What's keeping you?
Hurry up!

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.330
There is some truth to what
Kazekage says.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.990
So shall we extend it for
ten minutes from now.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.080
So…let Genma know of this.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.910
Yes!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.950
If it stays like this, Uchiha will really
be forced to withdraw.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.410
I see…a ten-minute extension…

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.000
Sasuke…

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.200
Hey, isn’t that…

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.000
Y-You are…

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.790
But, what’s that idiot doing!
He’s still not here?!

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.040
Sasuke…!

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.290
Please!

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.540
Good of the two of you to make it!

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.870
Come now, hurry into the arena!

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.990
Yeah!

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.990
All right! Here we go!

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.080
Oh! Yeah!

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.250
Most of the first round is finished,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.450
and the only one left is
Sasuke Uchiha and Gaara.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.750
H-How about Naruto and
Neji’s match…?!

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.290
Well, the interesting thing is…

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.990
That Hyuga lost…

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.750
Naruto beat Neji…

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.950
I see…

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.410
You did it!

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.990
Naruto!

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.990
You’re such a…
good guy really…

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.330
– What’s going on with the next match!
– Let's get on with it!

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.000
Isn’t Uchiha up yet?!

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.080
We want Uchiha! Uchiha!

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.580
Uchiha!

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.620
Hey, it’s almost time.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.990
Is he really gonna come?!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.990
He’ll come…

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.990
He’ll definitely come!

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.700
Oh Sasuke, what’s he doing!

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.040
What the heck is Uchiha doing?!

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.660
It seems the rumor that
he’d had a serious injury was true.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.500
If there’s a win by default,
then this match is mine.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.990
Thirty more seconds…

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.450
Uchiha!

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.790
Uchiha!

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.580
Sasuke…please come!

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:24.870
Sasuke!

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.250
Hurry up and come!

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.990
It won’t be good if it stays this way!

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.950
The time limit is up.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.500
So this is it.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:40.990
Because the time limit has expired,
the last match…

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.080
See… Here he is…

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.200
Well, I’m sorry we’re late…

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.410
Sasu…

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.990
Your name?

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.040
Sasuke…Uchiha.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.700
Sasuke…Uchiha.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160
Sasuke!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.410
It looks like he made it in time.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:57.330
Lee!

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.410
Darn… Causing others
this much trouble…

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.500
and thinking himself so important!

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.330
Huh! You’re pretty late!

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.160
I thought you weren’t coming
‘cause you were scared to take me on!

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.330
Who the heck was it that
said he’d come for sure?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.990
The first round…did you win?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.250
Of course!

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.870
Don’t get too carried away…

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.330
Loser!

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.870
Well, I know it’s somewhat rude
to be showing up all flashy like this…

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.580
but was Sasuke…

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.750
disqualified?

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.450
So your habit of tardiness
rubbed off on him? Cripes…

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.830
And…what about it?

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.700
It’s all right, Sasuke’s match
has been postponed anyway.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.410
Your arrival was barely in time, but…

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.700
he hasn’t been disqualified.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.200
That’s good to hear!

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.120
Don’t lose to a guy like that!

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:21.830
Yeah…

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.580
I want to fight you too…

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.200
Sasuke!

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.450
I want…to fight you too!

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.410
Yeah…

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.290
Yay, Sasuke!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.990
Uchiha's match is gonna start!

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.790
Shikamaru gave it so much,
but already it’s Sasuke…

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.870
Poor Shikamaru…

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.990
Hey, is that Uchiha?

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.120
I‘m just second fiddle…

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.040
Well, I guess that’s just
the way it goes…

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.990
I’m looking forward to it too.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.790
Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.000
What is?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.540
Well, Naruto did beat that
Neji Hyuga and…

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.120
Sasuke is an elite member
of the Uchiha…

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.990
and it seems like everyone’s
anxious to see Sasuke’s match.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.990
Sasuke will face that Gaara
of the Sand whom I couldn’t beat…

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.660
And Naruto beat that Neji
that I had hoped to take down.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.750
Why is it so…

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.120
Why am I so…

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.500
frustrated!

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:07.750
Lee…!

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.790
At last…

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.040
Gaara, come down here!

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.950
Naruto! Let’s go up!

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.080
Yeah!

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.250
When we go up,
we’ll leisurely take the stairs.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.830
What’s up with you!

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.000
Are you still upset that
I pushed you down?!

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.990
T-This isn’t good…

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.990
It’s been quite awhile
since I’ve seen Gaara like this.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.500
H-Hey…Gaara.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.700
Keep the strategy in mind--!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.250
Don’t talk to Gaara right now!

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.200
You’ll be killed.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:29.950
Right!

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:31.990
Let’s go!

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.990
Hey, hurry up!

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.250
Nothing good’s gonna happen
in your life if you panic.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.250
What’s wrong?

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:47.540
Huh?

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:06.040
Low-level tournaments like this
Chunin Examination are ideal

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.540
as gambling matches.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.500
A number of feudal lords
are here for that purpose.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.830
So…would you lose this match for us.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.250
Hey, come on,
at least give us an answer.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.750
Too scared to say anything…

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.080
H-Help!

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.870
S-Stop! Stop!

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.830
If those two in front of us
hadn’t been there,

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.160
we probably would’ve been killed…

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.200
This is the first I’ve seen anyone
kill people without hesitation like that…

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.200
This isn’t looking good
even for Sasuke.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.990
Sasuke…

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.870
So now…at last…

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:29.990
Everyone makes mistakes
lt's nothing to be ashamed about

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:41.200
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.990
Yes, breathe in the air
Lift your face to the sky and jump

00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:02.000
If it rains, take a break
Go where the wind takes you

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:07.330
So many regrets
Don’t let this scar be for naught

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.830
Let’s go carve the badges
                                in our chest

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.580
Yes, it’s Show Time,
life begins now.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:22.870
Everyone makes mistakes
 It’s nothing to be ashamed about

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:33.540
Don’t let this scar be for naught
Walk with a smile

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:44.080
Transform sadness into the wind
and continue to forge on

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.870
Forge on strong

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.990
Darn it!
What kind of guy is that?!

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:09.990
Gaara is totally not normal!
He doesn't even look at us.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.200
If anyone fights with him like that…

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.580
Darn! Hey Shikamaru!
We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.200
We've got to stop this fight,
no matter what!

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.200
Next time, "Bushy Brow's Jutsu:
Sasuke Style!"

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.870
If nothing's done,
Sasuke's a goner!
