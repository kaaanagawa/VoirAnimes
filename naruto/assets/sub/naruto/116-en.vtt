WEBVTT

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.060
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:29.890
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.270
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.440
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.600
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.150
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.150
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.310
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.980
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.940
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.850
Gentle Fist: 8 Trigrams 64 Palms!

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.890
Uh-oh!

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.400
8 Trigrams 2 Palms!

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.940
4 Palms!

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.810
8 Palms!

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.980
16 Palms!

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.060
32 Palms!

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.890
64 Palms!

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.890
What’s going on?!

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.150
A golden body surface…?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.440
It’s the same material as the weapon
he spit out of his mouth earlier…

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.310
That was close.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.940
I hear that if you’re hit straight on
with Gentle Fist,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.560
your Chakra Network gets damaged

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.650
and you become unable
to build up Chakra…

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.440
That was close.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.150
Are you a monster?

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.440
It seems to come
not just from your mouth.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.350
Gum Style Spider Thread…

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.890
is a metal that hardens
the instant it leaves my body.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.730
Moreover, it doesn’t let Chakra through.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.520
And…it can be secreted
not just from my mouth,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.810
but also from the sweat glands
throughout my body.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.190
Attacks on Chakra points won’t work.
Now it makes sense…

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.770
The Spider Web Net won’t work.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.690
And there’ll be no close-range
combat fighting

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.270
against a Gentle Fist opponent.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.890
In other words,

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.890
I just have to attack the blind side
from long distance.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.890
There’ll be no sound…
lt’ll be in a flash.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.190
The game’s over.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.440
The Kunai Knife is a fake!

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.150
What?!

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.350
8 Trigrams Palm…

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.020
Rotation!

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.400
Wha–?! What is that?!

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.270
Does he…have eyes behind him?!

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.020
And the defense just now…

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.600
He repelled physical attacks
with Chakra?!

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.520
360 Degrees of Vision:
The Byakugan's Blind Spot!

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.890
If we’re not prepared for
“one person, one kill,”

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.480
then it’s not going to work out…

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.310
That’s what you said earlier.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.980
Hurry up and go!
I’ll catch up with you all!

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.890
We have to be prepared for
“one person, one kill.”

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.690
Naruto…

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.190
You’ve got better eyes than me.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.100
Neji…

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.940
Catch up with us, no matter what!

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.100
Can he see me?!

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.150
What the heck is he?!

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.480
I know you’re there.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.650
Come out.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.020
Those eyes…

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.890
It seems they can do more
than just see through the Chakra flow…

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.810
So I see there was
an extraordinary Visual Jutsu user.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.270
A long range battle
is unfavorable…

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.060
I must bring this to
close combat by all means.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:04.980
Very well.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:15.440
I’ll acknowledge that this game has
a somewhat high level of difficulty!

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.890
I too shall go for it seriously…

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.310
It’s like he’s a totally different person
from before…

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.060
His Chakra activity is overwhelming.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.020
And those markings…

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.310
His move earlier…

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.520
He dodged an attack aimed
from behind

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.890
and was able to see me hiding
in the shadows.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.060
In other words,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.150
he has a combined wide range
of sight and X-ray vision.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.730
And what’s more, that Jutsu…

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.480
If so…

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.310
Summoning Jutsu!

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.890
Your ability…

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.690
I’ll find a way to impeccably assault it.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.060
If he defends
against physical attacks

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.600
with a large emission
of Chakra and its Rotation…

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.400
all I need to do then is to stop
that Chakra Rotation!

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:38.850
Scatter!

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.890
Rotation!

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.020
It’s starting to stop.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.650
Here!

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.890
Die!

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.940
He released the Chakra just in time
and repelled the Kunai Knife!

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.100
To think he’d stop my Chakra Rotation

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.190
by binding it with Chakra threads…

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.520
These things…

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.940
I just have to cut them for now.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.440
If the Rotation won’t do,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.310
then I just have to dodge
each and every one.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.020
This guy uses
close-range Taijutsu-style combat .

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.770
There will be no problem
if I fight him from afar.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.890
In that way…
I’ll have a good long look at your ability.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.270
8 Trigrams, 64 Palms!

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.520
What a number!

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.480
Hm?! His stance changed?!

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.890
8 Trigrams.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.980
128 Palms!

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.770
He’s fast!
The number of strikes has doubled…!

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.440
If I get nailed by that straight on,
it'll be the end for me.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.350
If that’s the case on his end,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.690
then it’ll be a battle of numbers
on this end, too!

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.650
The number’s too great!
I won’t have enough time!

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.020
The Rotation’s no good,
just as I thought…

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.890
It seems he has 360-degree vision.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.730
And it seems he deals
with enemy attacks

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.270
by combining his X-ray vision ability
for seeing through things

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:42.480
and his telescopic vision ability
for long-distance sight.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.690
Furthermore, although
he’s got 360-degree vision,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.890
that vision has a formidable extent…

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.440
If I were to determine the range
from his reaction before…

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.850
he almost unfailingly detected
the Kunai Knives

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:04.480
that entered the approximately
150-foot circumference around him.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.890
But for some reason,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.100
there are Kunai Knives
he can’t evade completely.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:13.900
If so…

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.400
8 Trigrams, Sixty…

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.440
I see…

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.890
This time, there’ll be even more.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.890
This time, two will hit…

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.900
I’ve found a way to impeccably
assault your ability!

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.400
It seems that defense technique

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.890
was something to compensate
for this weak point!

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.350
In other words...
Your Visual Jutsu isn’t perfect!

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.810
Why even bother?!
I’ve won the game!

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.890
Come on. Are you going to
keep at it for naught?

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.520
The fate of the small fry character in an
easy game is to be destroyed right away!

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.520
You can’t beat me!

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.940
– I-I’m not done yet.
– Lee…

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.270
You never give up do you?

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:32.520
No way you can beat him.
He’s a genius unlike you.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.520
Genius? What is genius anyway!

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.480
Even without any talent,
I’ll surpass “genius” by working hard.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.190
It’s no use, Lee.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.890
No matter how hard you work,
you cannot beat me.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.520
It’s already decided.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.350
Lady Hinata...

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.600
You’re the sheltered little baby
of the main branch.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.150
A person can never change.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.060
And then, this match…

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.890
Your destiny was decided at the point
when I became your opponent.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:13.400
You don’t know until you try!

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.770
This is the end…

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.190
Gentle Fist!

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:03.730
Small fry character one…
Destruction completed.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.600
Well, for a crummy game,
I was entertained…

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:21.770
Heh… I missed the fatal spots, huh?

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:27.310
And he wouldn’t easily die from
Kunai Knives from 150 feet away, eh?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.900
I see…
He’s still going to entertain me, huh?

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.520
This is thanks for that.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.400
Seriously, that fat Jirobo
can’t be helped,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.890
but what’s that clod Kidomaru
doing anyway…?

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.690
That lowlife!

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:02.520
He’s got the habit of playing games.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.230
Maybe he’s found someone
to entertain him?

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.480
When that idiot plays too much,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.060
he becomes hyper
and easily gets into that state…

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.890
But still...
Once he gets to the second state…

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.850
it’s instant death for the opponent.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:21:01.060
Maximum destructive power…
with 100% accuracy!

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.890
Die!

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.600
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.730
And you smiled

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.150
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.900
In my own words

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:41.690
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:47.100
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.890
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:58.600
You listened without turning away

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.890
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:11.890
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:14.980
I feel so sad

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.940
But…

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.520
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.560
And you smiled

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.230
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.310
In my own words

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.890
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.940
And you smiled

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.600
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.560
In my own words

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.100
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.270
He doesn’t carry out wasteful attacks.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.350
And he accurately reads
information from the results.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.890
No mistake, this guy’s the strongest
of all I’ve fought up until now!

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.810
I probably won’t be able
to evade the next attack.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.890
I’ve had enough.
I can’t dodge it anyway.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:12.770
Since the secret of my eyes
has been discovered, I won’t run or hide!

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.890
Next episode: “Losing is Not an Option!”
