WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.190
Press down hard on the gas

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.090
That’s right, there’s no compromise

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
We'll slip through the night

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.960
At the final moment push hard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.140
That's right, all the way to zero,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
Until we wipe away the days

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.450
Gently open your heart

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.020
If you pull it close to you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.550
It will reach you, without a doubt

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.560
It will come, closer

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.560
Now

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.940
We’re speeding through life,
squeezing it for all of its worth

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.410
Our feet are tied

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.210
But we still keep going farther

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.650
Even if I take it back, and grasp it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.380
If you’re not the one

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.720
There will be no meaning

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.130
And so we’ll go far off into the distance.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.550
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.520
At this point in time,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.560
I don’t even plan to fight
over Sasuke with you.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.460
Sakura!

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.560
Do you know who
you’re lipping off to?!

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.930
Don’t press your luck,
crybaby Sakura!

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.540
It seems like...
it seems like Sakura was out of line!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.910
Ino’s eyes show incredible anger.
She’s scary.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.540
Hmm.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.310
That's not it…

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.780
Huh?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.010
Sakura’s not the kind of kid
to do things

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.750
like needlessly flaunt her
own power and hurt people.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.860
She doesn’t like having Ino
taking pity on her and pulling punches.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.210
– This time for sure,
– This time for sure,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.810
– with full strength,
– with full strength,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.980
– a fair... fight!
– a fair... fight!

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.560
The Ultimate Battle: Cha!

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.540
Just a Clone Jutsu…?!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.710
This isn’t a Ninja Academy’s
graduation exam!

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.010
You think you can beat me…

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.920
with a textbook ninja art?!

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.190
If I look carefully, I can find out,
which is the real one right away…

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.920
Chakra to my feet at a burst…Then…

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.390
repel off the ground!

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.130
Fast!

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.530
If you think I’m the crybaby Sakura
I was until recently,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.800
you’ll get your fingers burned!

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.940
Come like you mean it, Ino!

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.540
I appreciate you saying that…

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.250
I’ll go like I mean it, as you wish!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.560
Way to go Sakura!

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.560
Great!

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.190
Really great!

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.560
With the fundamental movements
using Chakra,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.300
she’s topnotch among the rookies…

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.130
Huh?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.530
Sakura is at her best.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.000
That means…
ls she better than me?

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.070
Well!

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.110
That’s right.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.570
Awww!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.550
Sending Chakra all throughout
the body and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.180
using the technique
with it at a right timing…

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.420
Those techniques alone
are better than Sasuke.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.650
Well, from the start,
she was extremely good at…

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.560
controlling her Chakra, so…

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.560
Magnificent movements, Sakura!

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.880
However, her opponent is good too.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.850
This evenly-matched battle
looks to take awhile!

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.820
Since when did this girl
get this strong?!

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.990
I can make it, too…!

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.560
You little…!

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.840
Whoa!

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.940
At this rate, it’ll never end.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.810
This is long…

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.850
They’ve been going at it
for ten minutes, at the least.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.200
You shouldn’t be evenly
matched with me!

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.540
What makes you think
I’m evenly matched with you…

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.540
who’s only concerned with looks
and growing your hair frivolously?!

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.540
You!

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.110
You carry your mocking
of me too far!

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.480
Idiot.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.550
She’s going for the bait.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.050
Who knows what Ino will do!

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.060
I don’t like Ino when she’s that way…!

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.310
You’re simple-minded…

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.350
Uh-oh.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.550
She’s totally lost it!

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.150
I don’t need this!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.800
S-Scary…

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.460
I’ll put an end to this right now!

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.600
I’ll make you say that you lost!

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.710
Hey, don’t tell me…

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.410
Could it be…?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.750
As I recall, that Sign is…

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.550
I knew it…

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.150
She’s planning to do
the Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.650
Man…That idiot!

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.090
I understand your feelings of frustration,
but that’s futile.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.230
Humph!

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.130
I wonder!

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.170
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu…

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.540
A Jutsu where the user can take
over the opponent’s spirit

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.810
and wrest their body away
for a few minutes…

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.540
by discharging all of
their own spiritual energy

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.940
and striking the enemy with it.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.550
But, there are major flaws
to this formidable Jutsu.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:08:00.690
First, the discharged spiritual energy
can only fly straight and at a slow speed.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:08.170
Second, even in the case of failing
to hit the enemy and missing,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.670
the user can’t return to her
own body for several minutes.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.810
I should add that during
that interval, the user’s,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.640
in other words, your main body
will turn into a doll that won’t move at all!

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.650
In the first place,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.550
the Mind Transfer Jutsu is used
for spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.560
Ino, using that Jutsu here
would be equal to suicide…

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.060
It shouldn’t be particularly
scary if she moves about…

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.430
And not only that,
if she dodges the Jutsu,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.600
she can beat the heck out
of the non-moving opponent.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.840
If that happens, Hayate will be forced
to put an end to the match…

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.340
So what?!

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.570
I won’t know unless I try!

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.540
If you miss, it’s over.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.550
You know that, right?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.550
In the first place,
it’s a combination Jutsu to be used

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.650
after stopping the opponent’s
movements during a battle

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.920
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:06.560
There’s no way!

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960
There is no way, it will hit…

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.830
Idiot! Stop!

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.800
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.550
Which one…?

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.500
That was unfortunate…

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:49.400
Ino.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.740
Has the fat lady sung…?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.540
She went and did it…

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.370
Then, it’s over, eh.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.680
This is…?!

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.190
You fell for it, Sakura!

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.360
I finally caught you!

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.260
It can't be!

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.600
Yes, it can.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.970
My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.570
to drive you who was running
about into this contrivance.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.310
So?

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.540
You can’t move at all, can you?

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.210
It’s special rope that’s my hair
with Chakra poured in!

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.560
With this, it will be over when
I enter your body and say “give up!”

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.560
It wouldn’t miss
a hundred percent of the time!

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.600
I see…

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.130
That idiot… Her losing it
was also an act?

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.270
Get out of there, Sakura!

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.540
I can’t move…!

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.470
Then…

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.540
Mind Transfer Jutsu!

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.830
That was unfortunate…

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.540
She missed!

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.210
No!

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.540
Sakura…

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.110
Sakura!

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.650
Sakura!

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.840
W-What’s with Ino?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.570
Also... Sakura’s acting kind of strange!
Believe it!

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.940
But…surely this is her chance!

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:15.610
Do it, Sakura!

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.850
It’s no use.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.980
To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there…

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.590
Sakura’s had it.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.360
Mind Transfer…?!

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.830
That means Sakura right now is…

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.430
Yes.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.430
Sakura’s spirit has been
completely taken over by Ino.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.870
What?!

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.840
Ino is inside of Sakura’s body now!

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.410
Well.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.940
Ino’s purpose is most likely…

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.880
With this, it’s over.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.150
Good bye, Sakura…

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.400
I…Sakura Haruno concede…

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.240
– this match… 					– No!

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.400
Sakura!

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:15.270
Tsk!

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.610
He’s annoying!

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.280
You did your hardest to get here!

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.910
You’ll disgrace women if you lose
to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.850
Like I said, those words
are useless…

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.560
What's...

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.560
this bad chill…?!

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.540
Naruto is annoying!

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.550
Anyway, that’s right…
not to Ino I won’t …

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.650
Sakura?!

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:58.880
This can’t be happening…

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
What’s the matter?

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.820
Are you conceding?

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.400
I won’t be conceding!

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.100
No Way!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.730
Cha!

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.340
Which is it?

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.440
W-What’s going on?!

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.670
Sakura…?!

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.710
No way!

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.550
I messed up my Jutsu…?

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:38.160
Ino…You’ll have a terrible time of it
if you don’t get out of me quick!

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.560
What’s wrong, with Ino?

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.770
No… I won’t hold on at this rate…

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.640
Release!

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.500
It can’t be…
She shattered Ino’s Jutsu!

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.070
She used too much energy
before the Jutsu…

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.500
So she didn’t have enough Chakra…?!

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.710
To think she has two spirits…
What are you?!

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.150
Strength that ranks with beauty.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:45.520
Girls can’t survive if they’re not tough!

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.930
If caught in that spell,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.260
it’s not that easy to cast out
the invader…

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.430
Ino’s lack of Chakra…

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.170
There’s also that…

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.600
But what was more effective
 than that…

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.540
was the combative spirit towards
lno she has inside her heart.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:10.380
So that was awakened with Naruto’s voice
as the trigger and she cast Ino out…?

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.880
There’s nothing to it.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.580
Like Naruto…

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.020
Sakura’s fighting spirit was
much stronger than others.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.560
– This is…! 					– This is…!

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:26.600
But, both of them should
have hardly any Chakra left.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.070
– This is… 					– This is…

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.100
– the end! 					– the end!

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.340
Both parties are unable
to continue the match!

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.680
By double knockout,

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.210
no one gets through the
fourth battle of the preliminary!

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.220
– What?! 					– Huh?!

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.920
Now then...

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.560
Good grief.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.130
Hey, Ino!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.390
Sakura!

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.560
Sakura!

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.930
A-A-Are you okay?!

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.150
Treatment’s not necessary.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.550
They’ll probably wake up after awhile.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.160
But, that was surprising…

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:35.090
Yeah…

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.260
Naruto and Sasuke aside…

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.730
to think even that Sakura who didn’t
have what it took has grown this much…

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.800
A lot happened,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.140
but I really feel like it
was a good thing…

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.440
sending her to this Chunin Exam.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.160
Tenten vs. Temari

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:12.230
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.560
Now…

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.770
The second one from the
Land of Sand, huh…

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.900
– This looks to be an interesting match.
– Do your best, Tenten!

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.320
It looks like you finally
woke up, eh…Sakura.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.550
Huh?!

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.550
Tenten, power of youth!

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:38.820
Go Go!

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.190
There is no limit to your youth!

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.760
Our match is already over.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.270
Did I…lose?

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.540
I’m the one who wants to cry…

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.380
To think I tied with somebody like you…

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.420
Huh?

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.580
Here!

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.320
You also got a flower to bloom, didn’t you?

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.460
A beautiful flower!

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.900
Ino…

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.080
However...

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.550
the next time we fight,

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.550
it won’t end with you
getting knocked out!

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.550
Hm…?!

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.920
And… I won’t hand over
Sasuke to you!

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.890
I return the same line to you!

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.430
– Humph! 					– Humph!

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:56.670
The fifth battle…

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.100
Tenten, Temari…
come forward!

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.330
Hey, can you hear it?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:31.640
The clear, blue sky goes on and on

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:41.480
The ocean spans limitlessly

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:49.550
Please keep that smile on your face forever

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.560
Or else I’ll cry

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.460
You won't have to search around you

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.100
It’s all ok now.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:12.940
Everyone is inside
this hand

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.520
when you want to cry,
and you want to run away

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.850
When you forget what happiness is

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.660
Just sing.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:32.130
Light is born, and darkness was born

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.460
The two are one

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.670
Harmonia, feel the telepathy

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:46.440
Hey, can you hear it?

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.180
You know! You know!

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.520
I feel like women battles
are incredible, or…

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.090
Women are scary.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.820
Huh?

00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:58.820
Hey-hey!

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.960
This isn’t the time to be
withdrawing, Shikamaru.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.460
You’re kind of a plain, or a lousy,
or an unimpressive guy, aren’t you?

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.870
If you don’t really put your whole heart
into it, things will get hairy for you.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.970
Next episode:
“Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru”

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.840
This is really, seriously bad!
