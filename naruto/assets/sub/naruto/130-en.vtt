WEBVTT

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.800
Hey boys, listen up!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.550
Humans aren’t such a big deal

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.350
Who needs tomorrow anyway,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.590
so don’t hide your fists

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.680
You’re not old enough

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.140
to sell your dreams away to uncertainty

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.590
Hey boys, you’re the only ones

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.100
who can pull the trigger in your heart

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.550
All the kids said

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.550
We’re living in this senseless, ridiculous,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
awesome world right at this moment,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.430
All the kids said

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.260
Don’t forget every truth or lie

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.890
All the kids said

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.350
We’re way too young to die

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.180
In this empty town lined with empty faces

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.510
All the kids took off

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.930
into this windless night

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.470
Because they want to change something

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.590
With this, you’ve woken up, right?

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.100
We had a hindrance back then…

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.260
but it won’t be like
that this time.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.100
I’ll show you…
the true power of Sharingan.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.590
Fine…Then I’ll go all out too!

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.600
You take a good look
with your Sharingan…

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.970
at my Way of Ninja!

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.550
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.470
You can’t beat me by just pointlessly…
increasing the number!

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.970
You little--!

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.590
I can spot the real body in
one shot with my Sharingan.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.590
I deliberately went along
with your game…

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.590
I won’t go easy on you now!

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.220
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.470
Father-Son:
                       The Broken Crest

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.140
What was up…
with those eyes of Big Brother’s?

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.640
That wasn’t…
just an ordinary Sharingan.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.590
And…quite a bit of time’s
passed since then…

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.470
but things are still kind of awkward
between him and Father.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.220
Good morning, Father…

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.550
Yeah, good morning.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.680
Sasuke… how have things
been going at the Academy lately?

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.590
It’s boring with just school classes.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.930
I’m always number one, so…

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.390
W-Wow…

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.390
This is the fundamental
Jutsu of the Uchiha.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.050
The Sign is as I taught you earlier.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.100
You build up Chakra,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.590
stop it once at around between
the mouth and the chest area,

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.800
and spew it out at once after that.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.180
Try it.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.930
Okay!

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.800
Father…is teaching me Jutsu himself.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.390
Finally… Father has also recognized me!

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.260
I must live up to his expectations!

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.010
I too can…!

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.390
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.590
Sure enough, it won’t go like
it did with Itachi, huh?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.590
It might’ve still been
too soon for you.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.220
A member of the Uchiha Clan
is not recognized as full-fledged

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.510
until they can use the Fire Style.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.640
The Uchiha crest…

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.350
means those who possess
the Uchiha that controls fire.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.470
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.550
Damn it! One more time!

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.930
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.180
Today for sure!

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.890
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.720
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.590
Sasuke…!

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.010
Wait a minute.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:19.590
What is it?

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.760
What…?

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.470
Oh… Don’t move.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.590
Okay, finished!

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.050
Mother…

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.470
Hmm?

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.970
No… It’s nothing.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.050
Okay…

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.180
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.140
Sure enough, it won’t go
like it did with Itachi, huh?

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.800
It might’ve still been
too soon for you…

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:32.590
I’m just, getting started.
Damn it! One more time!

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.600
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.300
Father!

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.930
Hmm?

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.970
One more time…

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.850
One more time…
Please join me.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.470
It’s still too soon for you.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.680
Even if I were to teach you
for only after a week…

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.390
It’s not that…

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.800
I’ve gotten…the hang of the Jutsu.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.140
So I want you to see it.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.390
Failure is not an option!

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.180
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.760
That’s my boy.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.100
You’ve done well.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.470
From now on, improve yourself
and soar large

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:47.430
so as not to bring shame
to the crest on your back.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:52.930
Right!

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.050
And…let me say one thing.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.180
Don’t chase after
your older brother anymore.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.640
Mother…?

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.300
Hmm?

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:24.720
What does Father really think of
Big Brother and me?

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.590
What is it all of a sudden?

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.590
The other day, Father said to me,
“That’s my boy.”

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.720
He’d always said that only
to Big Brother.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.220
So I was really happy.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.850
I see…Good for you.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:51.430
But lately, Father and Brother
haven’t been getting along, so…

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.180
I was thinking…

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.260
that I might just be
a replacement for Big Brother.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.590
Your older brother’s your older brother.
And you are you.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.470
Your father cares deeply
about you both.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.680
Then why does he only think
about Big Brother?!

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.220
That’s not it…

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.890
Your father has to protect
the Uchiha Clan

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.590
as a representative of the clan.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.010
What about it?!

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.590
Itachi is just bigger than you
and is your elder.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.590
He’ll naturally be entrusted

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.140
with that much more work
for the clan, right?

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.590
Your father is the supervisor
of the work, so…

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:43.010
it might be that his eyes were
likely to go towards your older brother.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.180
But, this is just between us.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.590
When he’s with me,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.590
your father does nothing
but talk about you.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:06.510
He’s just always sullen
and awkward, so…

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.140
I’ll catch up to Big Brother
no matter what!

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.350
Damn it…!

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.300
Big Brother’s back is still
far out of reach.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.590
Forgive me, Sasuke…
Maybe another time.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.800
Clan…Clan…

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:19.180
You measure incorrectly
the size of your own “vessels”

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.350
and don’t know the depth of mine,
so you grovel there.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:34.640
My “vessel” is
dismayed at this foolish clan.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.510
I feel like…ever since that day,

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.590
he hasn’t been the same
as he was before.

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.350
Big Brother…

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.590
Today, when school’s finished,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.680
will you join me for
some Shuriken Jutsu training?

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.010
I’m busy.
You should have Father teach you.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:09.590
But even I know that you’re better
at Shuriken Jutsu than Father is.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.300
You always treat me like
a nuisance like that.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:32.590
Forgive me, Sasuke.
Maybe next time…

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.010
I don’t have the time to
be dealing with you today.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.470
You always say, “Forgive me, Sasuke,”
and poke me on the forehead.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.850
and you say “today,”
but it never happens.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.600
Thank goodness…
he’s the same as before.

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.220
Big Brother…

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.510
His eyes looking back
at Father that time…

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.590
It wasn’t just an ordinary Sharingan…

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.350
And…

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:38.590
Father…?

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.590
Hmm?

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.590
Are there several types
of Sharingan?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.640
Oh…You’re already interested
in Sharingan?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.600
However, it's still too soon for you.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.100
It’s totally different from
the Fire Style Jutsu.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.220
But someday, I too…!

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.720
After all… I’m your kid, so.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.600
Indeed, there is a Visual Jutsu
above the Sharingan,

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.100
the Mangekyo Sharingan.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.600
Mangekyo Sharingan…

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.220
In the long history of the Uchiha,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:21.590
it’s a legendary Visual Jutsu
that only a few develop.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:27.930
And it’s said that it only opened
under a particular condition.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:32.760
A particular condition…?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.720
Don’t chase after your
older brother anymore.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.180
I wonder what he thinks of my
relationship with Brother?

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:55.600
Father…

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.590
Why doesn’t Big Brother care
about me?

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.390
He’s a bit peculiar…

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.970
He’s a type of person who doesn’t
care for making friends with people.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.140
Why?

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.100
Who knows…?

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.720
Even I, his father, can’t read that boy.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.590
Here I spoke because I wanted
more of Big Brother’s attention.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.590
Father isn’t against it.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.720
Here, Sasuke!
Your box lunch.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:37.590
I’ll watch your Shuriken practice
after you come home.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.550
It’s not practice, it’s training!

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.640
I’m off!

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.140
That’s good…

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.800
It’s not that Father dislikes
Big Brother, after all.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:59.100
Big Brother graduated from the Academy
at the top of his class at age seven.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.600
He learned to use
the Sharingan at age eight.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.930
And he was promoted
to Chunin at age ten.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.680
But, I’ve got the same Uchiha blood
flowing inside me as he does.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.760
I won’t lose to him!

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.590
You’re not gonna tell me this is
the best you can do, are you?

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.760
You boast about your Way of Ninja
and this is all you've got?

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:37.970
Are you still thinking that
I’m a member of your comrade game?

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.180
If that’s the case, you're…

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.800
a hopeless fool!

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.550
Stop wasting time!

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.590
Give me all you’ve got,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.220
you number one hyperactive,
knucklehead Ninja!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.050
When I recalled the parts one by one,

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.510
I felt as though
I had understood everything

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:45.970
Faded words which I kept so close to me

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:55.680
Speechless nights, a hint of warmth,

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.590
and this distant yearning for you

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:11.800
I live, simply repeating this cycle

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:23.590
Held in my two hands
A droplet of time

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:33.970
Softly clutching forgotten memories
Lost words

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.640
I’ll keep these thoughts…

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.590
Just as Neji said,

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:55.180
it seems Sasuke’s in
the darkness right now.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:56.590
Damn it.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.680
He really did hit me with
all his might.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.590
Hey Sasuke, am I not your comrade
or anything anymore?!

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.890
Don’t all those things we
did together in Squad Seven

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.590
mean anything to you?!

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.260
