WEBVTT

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.760
C'mon!

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700
Running like a fugitive,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.970
Being chased by something

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.370
Inside my heart is pounding

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040
My throat dry like it's withering

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780
For no single one,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.580
To none does belong,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.560
This time is ours, right now...

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.790
Unraveling the pain,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.600
Unraveling our hearts,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.100
Unraveling shadows

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.470
Stifling our breath,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.440
Reaching for beyond,

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.870
Tearing through the dark

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.450
In fighting and in love

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.950
To the distant light above,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.590
Yes, we are on the way

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.660
I wanna rock...

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.670
Rockin' my heart

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.190
The Demon in the Snow

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.590
Gatô, why did you come here?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.960
And who are those henchmen?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.330
Our strategy has changed
a little…

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.570
I'm sorry about this Zabuza,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.610
but you will die here.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.510
What?!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.150
Since hiring a regular Shinobi
costs a lot of money,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.580
I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.590
And, it would have been even
more ideal

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.290
to save my money and effort if
Ninja-to-Ninja battles

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.360
ended in each killing the other off.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.960
Well, you are certainly not worthy
of being called

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.460
the Demon of the
Hidden Mist Village.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.800
If you were to ask me,
you're just a cute little demon!

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940
What are those guys?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.570
So many of them…

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.670
Kakashi…I apologize.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.040
Our fight ends here...

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.880
As long as my reason to
take down Tazuna is gone,

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.920
there is no reason to fight you either.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490
Yeah... you are right.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.230
That reminds me...

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.960
I owe him something.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.600
He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.710
Huh, he's dead.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.510
You bastard!

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.580
What do you think you're doing, hey?!

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.350
Stop! Don't act so recklessly…!

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.050
You say something, too!
He was your comrade, right?

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.560
Shut up, punk.
Haku is already dead.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.360
What…?

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.590
Don't you feel anything watching
him doing that!

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.600
Weren't you with Haku for a long time!

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.940
As Gatô used me…
I was simply using Haku.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.010
I thought I'd told you…

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.410
We Shinobi are merely tools.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.080
What I wanted were his skills
and not Haku himself.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.850
I have no regrets...

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.260
Do you...
Do you really mean that?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.890
Naruto, stop.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.600
There's no need to fight
him anymore...  Besides...

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.670
Shut up!
My enemy is still... this one!

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.110
He...

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.350
He really liked you!

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.050
Is there someone special in your life?

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.680
He liked you that much!

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.060
When a person feels he wants
to protect a person special to him,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.130
that person can truly become strong.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.230
Even so,
don't you feel anything at all?!

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.570
It's difficult for me to completely
become a Shinobi.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.840
You really... honestly...

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.310
don't feel anything at all?

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.140
I'd like to make that person's
dream come true...

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.510
For that, I could completely
become a Shinobi.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.050
When a person becomes
as strong as you...

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.590
Does that person really
behave like you?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.230
He threw his life away
for you!

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.600
I'd like to make that
person’s dream come true...

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.630
That is my dream.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.140
He didn't even fulfill his
own dreams and yet...

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.610
I was happy.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.010
To die as a tool...!

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.580
That's...
That's... too painful...

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.930
Kid...

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.580
Don't say anything... anymore.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.350
Haku was...

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.920
He wasn't just thinking of me.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.590
He was feeling pain inside
for you

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.430
while he battled you guys too...

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.830
I know. 					He was too kind...

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.970
I'm glad we could fight with you
at the end.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.010
Huh?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.680
Yes, little punk,
it's as you say, after all...

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.890
Shinobi are human too...

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.690
Maybe it's impossible to become
an emotionless tool...

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.630
I've lost.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.470
Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.980
Okay...

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.590
What?!

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.190
Enough! Take them down!

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.590
Right!

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.090
Are you crazy?

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.500
Do you think you can win by yourself
against this many of us?

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.670
D-Demon!

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.190
If you're so anxious
to join your friend...

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.590
you go ahead... alone!

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.860
Unfortunately...

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:41.430
I don't... intend on going...
to the same place... as Haku!

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.300
W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.410
You're going to hell with me!

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.580
It's no big deal...

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.680
When the Demon of
the Hidden Mists Village

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.790
dies and goes to hell,
he can become a real demon.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:04.590
Look forward to it!

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.920
I'll let you find out
for sure

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.460
if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.510
Haku...

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.460
Now... it's goodbye, Haku...

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.930
Thanks for everything...

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.600
I'm sorry...

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.380
Don't look away.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.780
It's the end for
a man who lived fiercely.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.450
Yup...

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.760
Did I... die...?

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.330
Sasuke!

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.960
Sakura...

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.370
Am I... am I...?!

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.910
Sakura, you're heavy.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.110
Huh?!

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.250
Sasuke...

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.060
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.490
Sakura... 					That hurts...

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.290
Things turned out well,
 didn't they, Sakura?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.600
Stop, you shouldn't move...!

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.630
Anyway, where's Naruto?

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.200
And also,
what happened to that mask guy?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.570
Naruto's fine.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.880
And... the masked kid,
he died...

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.580
Died? Did Naruto get him?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.590
Well... I'm not really sure,
but he protected Zabuza...

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.460
I had faith in you.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.430
You are awesome, Sasuke!

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.600
You avoided getting inflicted with
any mortal wounds!

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.030
From the beginning... he intended to...

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.440
Naruto!

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:06.600
Sakura...

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.570
Sasuke's all right!
He's alive!

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.210
Huh?

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.960
He was feeling pain inside
for you while he battled you guys too...

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.990
He was too kind...

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.430
I see... He...

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.430
So, Sasuke's all right too...

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:39.770
That's a relief...

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.040
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.580
You guys are too relaxed!

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:50.250
Darn Ninja...!
Killing our source of money!

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.020
Now that it's come to this,

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.580
there's no choice but to attack
the whole town and

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.120
take everything valuable!

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.460
Shoot, this isn't good!

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:00.590
Kakashi Sensei!

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.590
Don't you have a Jutsu
to annihilate them all at once?

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.230
That's impossible!
I've used too much Chakra!

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.030
Here we go!

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.510
Enemies who come any closer
to the island...

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.280
With all the might of
all the island's people...

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.250
will not be allowed to live!

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.580
Yeah!

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.750
Inari!

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.460
Heroes always arrive
on the scene late!

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.590
Inari... You guys...

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.370
Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.340
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:55.010
I can do that even
with my scarce Chakra...

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.580
At least, it will bluff...

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.920
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.220
Kakashi Version!

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.590
So... are you ready to fight?!

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.590
No, we're not!

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.440
We've done it!

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.490
Sounds like it’s over.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:42.890
Yeah...

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.500
Kakashi...
I need to ask you a favor.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.530
What is it?

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:56.570
His...
I want to see his face...

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.780
All right.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.570
Huh?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.940
Snow...

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.580
Snow at this time
of the year...?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.590
Haku... 					Are you crying?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.200
Thanks, Kakashi...

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.550
You were always at my side...

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.380
At the very least...

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.420
I can be at your side in the end.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.630
If it's possible...

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.200
I'd like to go...

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.870
to the same place...

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.910
as you.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.570
This guy...

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:09.140
He was born in a village
where it snowed a lot.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.210
I see...

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:16.350
He was a boy as pure as snow...

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.380
You'd be able to go, Zabuza.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.790
The two of you... together.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.930
But you know, Kakashi Sensei...

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.530
Hmm?

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.630
I wonder if the way a Ninja
should be

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.570
is really as these
two were saying.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.910
Shinobi should not seek
the reason for their own existence.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.580
What's important is to
exist merely as tools.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.580
That's the same in the Land of Leaves.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.490
I wonder if that's what
it really means

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.590
to become a real Ninja.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.590
I guess... I guess...!

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.430
I don't like that!

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.230
Do you think so, too?

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.900
Hmm...

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.870
Well... That's why all Ninja live

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.410
trying to figure that
out without realizing...

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.780
Like Zabuza... and that kid...

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.050
Okay!

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.190
Huh?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.120
I've just decided!

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.490
I'm going to pursue my
own Way of Ninja!

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.660
I'm gonna sprint straight
ahead and pursue

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.100
a way that I absolutely
won't regret!

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.150
Thanks to you the bridge
was safely completed,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.080
but we will miss you very much.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.590
Take care.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.390
Thank you for everything.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.990
Now, now!

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.130
We'll come back for
a visit again, Tazuna!

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.000
For sure...?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.930
Huh?

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.510
Inari... you're gonna
miss us, aren't you?

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.210
It's all right to cry.
Go ahead and cry!

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.640
I won't cry!

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.250
It's all right if you cry,
Naruto!

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.780
Oh, is that so?

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.590
See ya!

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.590
Oh....!

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.600
You are so stubborn.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.340
That boy changed Inari's mind...

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.540
and Inari changed the minds
of the village people.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.140
That boy created a bridge
linking us to hope,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.450
a bridge called courage.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.050
So a linking bridge...

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.850
Speaking of bridges,

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.850
we need to name
this bridge, don't we?

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:12.490
That's true.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.620
In that case,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.490
I have a perfect name
for this bridge.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.500
Yeah, what is it?

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.170
The Naruto Great Bridge?
How's that ?

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:25.670
That's a good name.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.210
Okay! I'll get back soon
and have Iruka Sensei treat me

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.910
to ramen as
the mission completion celebration!

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.280
And! And! I'll tell Konohamaru
tales of my heroic exploits!

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.250
Then I...

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.350
Hey! Sasuke, do you want to go
on a date

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.550
when we get back to the village?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.260
No, I don't think so.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:47.920
Just like that...?!

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.630
You know! You know!
I'll go with you!

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760
Be quiet!

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.830
Shut up! Naruto!

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.570
What? Are you sure
that name's okay?

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.640
This name is to wish that
this bridge will never collapse...

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.480
And someday, it'll be the name
of a very famous bridge...

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.580
A name heard around the world.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.190
That's truly what I hope.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.600
Hey, hey!

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.470
Our Group Seven always
has the easy missions lately.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.600
Meanwhile, there are plenty of
powerful Ninja

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.640
like Zabuza and Haku in other lands.

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:16.970
Aren't there more exciting missions
where I can be more active?

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.580
Where I can use my Way of
the Ninja and my soul like…you know?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.580
Next time:
"A New Chapter Begins:
		The Chunin Exam!"

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.880
This is my Way of Ninja!
