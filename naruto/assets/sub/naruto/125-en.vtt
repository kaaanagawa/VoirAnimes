WEBVTT

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.080
Connecting old words
that have been used up

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.990
I just want to convey
my simple thoughts

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.290
That day's faint wind blows away

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.450
at the castle ruins of yesterday

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.620
I'll laugh with you
and live for the moment

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.160
Still that incident
will continue to trouble you, right?

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.040
That's why it must be good-bye

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.080
Leaving nothing behind,
let us share what is left

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:12.330
In time, we'll realize
that it was everything

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.000
And sadness will touch our cheeks,
creating a river of tears

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.990
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex
and melting away

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.000
The smell is moving away…

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.120
I’m saved…

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.040
Who is?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.990
Please wait!

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.410
The real deal…starts now!

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.990
My role now is to stall this person
as long as possible…

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.160
so, I should’ve avoided big techniques
that could be self-defeating…

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370
But it seems this isn’t an opponent
easy enough to beat

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.200
without using my Secret Technique…

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.830
Here I go!

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.200
I just had surgery
and am not at my best…

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.990
But if it’d just be opening the first of the
Eight Inner Gates, the Gate of Opening,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.990
I should somehow…

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.120
The first gate… The Gate of Opening…

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.450
Open!

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.330
Primary Lotus!

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.990
The impact of the kick
was suppressed by the bones…?!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.750
That’s some speed… But it’s over.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.990
Damn it… No matter how much I think,
I can’t come up with any good strategies…!

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.990
I’ve had it…can’t hold any further…

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.370
With me right in front of you,
you can’t even howl like a loser…?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.120
Huh?!

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.500
Die!

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.990
You’re mine!

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.370
Don’t you be smiling
before you’re going to die!

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700
What?!

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.450
Who’re you?!

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.450
It seems you’re an ally this time…

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.750
Who’re you?!

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.790
A Sand…

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.950
Shinobi…

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.950
ally of the Leaf!

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.990
The Sand Shinobi:
Allies of the Leaf

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.540
The Sand…?! Am I still drunk…?

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.200
Gaara of the Desert…

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.700
Gaara.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.990
Is that who you are?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:47.990
Digital Shrapnel!

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.830
Did he blow the finger tip bones…?!

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.990
Impetuous…

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.990
You…

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.500
When you fought me…
you had more speed and sharpness.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.870
Easy to say…

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.500
It’s not that I’m holding a grudge…

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.700
But on account of you,
I had kind of a tough time of it.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.870
I see…

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.410
But…why you…?

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.040
I owe a lot…

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.620
to the Leaf.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.750
Sasuke!

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.580
I heard that we’d made up
with the Sand traitors…

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.540
But to think you’d change
this abruptly…

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.990
It’s not like we attacked the Leaf
for the fun of it…

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.200
It was an order…

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.950
In the same way
that I’m here now.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.990
I see. The Fifth Hokage
asked the Sand…

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.830
It’s a big help.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.450
By the way…
has your sharpness gotten worse?

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:58.450
Huh?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.040
Are you going to give up again
or something?

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.870
This time, I’ll do it for you!

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.160
Sorry, but I can’t give up.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.750
A man mustn’t be protected
by a woman, so…

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.080
As usual, you’re a guy who’s annoying
with the man-and-woman stuff.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.540
Even if you act tough, it’s totally obvious
that it’s bravado, you idiot!

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.580
This time you’re taking sides
with the Leaf, huh?!

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.250
You guys sure are busy
all over the place!

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.870
She uses Genjutsu
with the sound of her flute.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:42.830
Right!

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.160
Cyclone Scythe Jutsu!

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.870
Blowing away the sounds of the flute

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.750
and being able to nail the opponent
with a physical attack.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:11.990
To think she can attack and defend
with one hand…

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.830
Unlike me, she has a nice Jutsu.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.990
That woman’s a natural enemy to me!

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.990
Has Ukon…just about caught him
according to the strategy?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.990
Puppet, huh…?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.910
You three had been approaching
together, right?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.870
Two went on ahead.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.990
You guys are weak, so…

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.700
You idiot… These guys are
out of the ordinary!

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:25.990
Behind you!

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.080
I can’t…move.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.790
What’s this guy?

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.370
I leave this to you, Sakon! Do it!

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.540
Where’s the other one?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.790
Hey! Who are you looking for?

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.160
That state… I know!

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.200
Be careful!
They enter the body and start to fuse!

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.200
It’s too late.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.250
This guy!

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.200
What’s the matter, Sakon?!

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.870
It seems like…

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.990
your Jutsu didn’t work…
on the puppet.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:51.080
This is a puppet, too?!

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.450
Let me tell you this.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.830
We, the Sand Ninja,
aren’t as lax as the Leaf.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.160
Moreover, don’t be carelessly
approaching…

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.200
the Black Ant!

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:18.790
He was fearsome
when he was an enemy...

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.990
But to think he’d be this dependable
when becoming an ally.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.370
Ow… I got careless.
Let me rest in your body for a bit.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.450
Good-for-nothing guy…

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:10.790
Who are these guys?

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.950
This is their ability!

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.040
Although you were caught off guard…

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.000
you getting hammered
by that puppet play…

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.830
Well…

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.750
Its power and speed
are nothing special.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.660
I won’t be beaten
by the likes of such a toy.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.080
And I was able
to heal my belly wound.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.500
I don’t have much Chakra left…
but well,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.910
these are opponents I should be able
to tear apart, nevertheless.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.990
Indeed, it seems he’s healed.
What a recovery ability he’s got.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.700
Ordinarily, I’m not the one
who becomes the main body,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.580
so it’s hard to move, damn it.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.870
You sure are mocking us…

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.620
He’s not an opponent
you can beat fighting head on!

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.040
We should retreat for now and…

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.160
We can’t back down after having been
mocked, you know.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.750
Don’t mess with me!

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.540
The Black Ant isn’t a Mechanism
for attacking.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.160
Primarily, it’s just for capturing.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.990
And…Crow paired up with the Black Ant
is exclusively for attacking.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.990
Hey you! Let me out!

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.250
Eat this!

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.580
Puppet Show…

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.830
Hey, let me out! Let me out!

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.990
Secret Black Move Iron Maiden!

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.870
The play is over.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.950
She hid, huh…?

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:26.990
Or did she run away?

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.950
No…That couldn’t be…

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.830
I just got here.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.990
Briefly explain the present situation

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.990
including an analysis of her ability
and battle style.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.660
First off, her fundamental tactic is
ensnaring her opponent in Genjutsu

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.200
with the sound of her flute.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.700
And then she delivers physical attacks
to that opening.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.990
Demon Flute: Chains of Fantasia!

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.410
This is bad! Is this Genjutsu?

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.580
I can’t move my body…!

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.990
I believe this was your last hand, right?

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.950
Unfortunately…
this is reversed checkmate!

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.200
You little rat!

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.990
She’s a classic Genjutsu-style
distance range type.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.080
Most likely, she must’ve seen your Jutsu
and figured out immediately

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.990
that it wouldn’t mix well
with her own Jutsu.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.990
And it’s two against one, too.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.950
She’ll never appear before us again
until she casts her Genjutsu.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.540
Sound, huh…?

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.410
Yeah…

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.250
Genjutsu generally appeal
to the five senses of people…

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.540
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.910
The type that uses hearing
is the most troublesome of them all.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.750
After she cleverly takes a distance on you
and then hides…

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.250
you have no idea where the Genjutsu
will be cast from or when.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.990
The idea is for us to already be cast
by the Genjutsu

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.080
by the time we’ve figured out where she is
by the sound of the flute…

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.910
Ouch…

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.080
In my opinion, we’re at an
overwhelming disadvantage.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.250
A battle with this type, essentially,
wouldn’t even be worth talking about

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.370
without sensor types
like Kiba or Neji.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.990
At this rate, we’ll get pushed into a corner
sooner or later.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.700
– We should just retreat…
– Who asked for your opinion?!

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.000
I told you to just explain the situation.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.990
Don’t misjudge my power…

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:01.750
If she thinks
she’s hiding well from me…

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.870
in a distance enough for the sound
of her flute to reach…

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.990
she’s naïve!

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.580
Summoning: Blade Dance

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:16.950
Cut!

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.950
All right…

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.660
I’ve made it this far.
lt’s about time for my Genjutsu…

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.500
Huh?

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080
How about it?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.250
It’s done.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:29.450
She’s sure…pushy.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.160
She’s scarier than my mom.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.540
Pretty good, huh?

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.250
But well…

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.410
I just have to be grateful
for this time…huh?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.160
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.290
And you smiled

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.950
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.700
In my own words

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:41.250
Would you think it was
a bother if I approached you?

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:46.910
Despite my doubts,
I worked up my courage

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:52.500
My clumsy attempts with words

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:58.160
You listened without turning away

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.450
No wonder I get carried away by you

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:11.540
But you don’t feel anything for me, do you?

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:14.790
I feel so sad

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.750
But…

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.080
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.120
And you smiled

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.990
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.990
In my own words

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.500
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.750
And you smiled

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.160
For the first time, I was able to speak

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.120
In my own words

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.910
For the first time, I spoke to you

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.910
I got careless earlier,
but it won’t be like that now!

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.240
Now, you please stand back.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.090
I’m grateful for the help,
but his opponent will be me!

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.430
Next, for sure,
with my ultimate Lotus…!

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:10.220
Hey, why are you moving forward?
I’m his opponent!

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.390
