WEBVTT

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.470
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.970
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.600
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.180
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.600
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.600
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.260
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.390
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.760
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.050
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.640
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.220
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.720
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.350
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.930
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.640
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.220
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.430
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.970
I never thought he’d attempt to use
the Fourth Hokage’s Jutsu.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
But it’s still just this level…

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.800
It’s completely different
from the original one.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.720
That Tsunade…
lncredibly strong as always.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.010
I remember a long time ago,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.470
getting punched by her and
knocked back nearly 100 meters…

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.640
At any rate, Naruto’s hopeless.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.680
Are you okay?

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.840
Jiraiya, was it you…

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840
who taught him that Rasengan,
the Spiral Chakura Sphere?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.840
Rasengan…?!

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.600
I’m his teacher, after all.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.510
Humph…You and the Fourth Hokage are
the only ones who can use that Jutsu.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.840
Are you in your right mind…

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.470
showing someone Jutsu
that he can’t master?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.510
Don’t give him false hope.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.930
That’s why the moony kid starts joking
about becoming a Hokage!

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.300
It’s no joke! Stupid! Stupid!

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.680
If I have three days,
I’ll master this Jutsu!

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.890
You said it, kid.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.390
Men don’t go back on their word!

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.100
Hah! I stand by my words.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.600
That’s my Ninja Way.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.800
Then…how about a wager?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.720
A wager…?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.760
I’ll give you one week.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.760
If you can master that Jutsu,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.350
I’ll acknowledge that you have
what it takes to become the Hokage

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.390
and give you this necklace.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.720
Lady Tsunade! That’s the precious--!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.840
I don’t need such a sorry necklace!

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.680
Don’t say such things, Naruto…

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.390
That’s the only one of its kind in this world.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.350
And you could buy three mountains
if you were to sell it.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.010
It belonged to the First Hokage.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.840
A-Awesome…

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.930
Well, that’ll be fine!

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.390
He’ll do anything for money…?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.470
Good…

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.350
However, you lose if you can’t master
the Jutsu in one week!

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840
And you’ll give me all the money
you have on you.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.300
Oh! Gama-chan!

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.550
When did she…?!

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.050
Lady Tsunade! Why?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.300
That necklace is…

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.050
He won’t be able to do it, anyway…

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.470
Let’s go, Shizune.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.510
She never once used
that necklace for a bet…

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.510
You don’t have to answer right now.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.840
However, I want it in a week.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.840
Inheritance!
The Necklace of Death!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.470
Huh? Who is it this late at night?

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.890
Okay, okay. I’m coming.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.100
I’m sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.
I need to talk to you…

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.970
As for me, I’m going to get
a good night’s rest and train tomorrow!

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.840
I’m sorry. But I didn’t want you
to misunderstand Lady Tsunade…

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.140
As well as the necklace…

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.970
Humph! I could care less
about an old lady like that!

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.510
Lady Tsunade is not the type
of person you think she is!

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.640
Don't speak of her like that
when you don't even know her!

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.800
I-I’m sorry…for raising my voice.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.220
She didn’t used to be like that.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.350
She was a kind person
who loved the village.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.140
But, she changed…

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.470
After that day…

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.100
That day?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.850
What’s that day?

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.180
The day she lost her dreams,
her love, her hopes… Everything.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.850
All that was left was
that necklace of memories…

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.050
It’s as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.430
It’s really not something
to be offered in a bet.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.510
I don’t care about that!
She bet it on her own, right?!

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.180
Besides…that necklace is really
not something for you to wear.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.140
It’s not just a necklace!

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.840
It doesn’t acknowledge anyone
other than Lady Tsunade.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.720
If someone else wears it,
that person inevitably…

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.890
…dies!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.390
Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.930
I’m not a kid anymore,
so I don’t need gifts on my birthday!

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.180
What’re you saying?
You’re still a kid, aren’t you?!

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.510
But never mind that.
Hurry up and open your present!

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.600
You’ll definitely be pleased!

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.850
Big Sister, could this be…?

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.470
Yes… It’s the First Hokage’s,
our grandfather’s necklace!

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.180
I love you, Big Sister!

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.470
I thought it’d be better than me having it.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:51.180
You’ve been wanting it all along, right?
Take good care of it.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Not just this necklace!

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:00.760
This village is grandfather’s treasure!
I’m going to protect it!

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.720
Nawaki…

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.430
I’m the grandson of the Hokage who
built the Village Hidden in Leaves, so…!

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.760
You said it.
Men don’t go back on their word!

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.600
Right!

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.840
Someday, I’ll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.720
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.050
Take off your headband, Nawaki.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.840
Just hurry up and take it off.
I have another present for you.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.680
It’s a charm to make
your dream come true.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.510
It’s best if you don’t look
at the remains.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.430
There’s nothing wrong with that,
is there?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.390
Even if she were to look,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.390
she wouldn’t be able to determine
that it’s her little brother.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.840
Enough, Orochimaru!

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.050
We are at war, now.
All Shinobi end up like this.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.760
There are no doctors on
the battlefield, so…

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.050
However, children really get
much too excited, don’t they?

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.800
Especially on the day after
they receive a present.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
Not just this necklace…

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.840
This village is grandfather’s treasure!
I’m going to protect it!

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.720
First, in a mission where
a Four-Man Cell must act alone

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.930
for a long period of time
in enemy territory,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.850
by deploying one of the four
to be a medical specialist,

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.260
the survival rate as well as
the mission success rate

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.890
should go up significantly.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.930
Therefore, establishing a framework

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.840
to foster Ninja possessing
advanced medical skills

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.510
and the development of
a medical institution

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.430
should be considered
an urgent task for the present!

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.180
Yes indeed, it’s as you say.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.840
But we’re in the middle of a war now.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.680
It takes too much time to
establish a medical framework.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.140
And at present,
we don't have enough knowledge…

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.010
Enemies don’t wait.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.010
What did you say?! Hey, old man!

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.800
Then we’ll never…

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.930
I agree with her.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.890
I don’t want the lives of the Shinobi
who died to be for naught.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:56.600
There should be something
we can learn from that.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.350
Excuse me!

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.300
Thanks for earlier.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.760
What you said was right.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.600
Umm…

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.260
It’s late.
Shall I walk you home?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.840
What? Is that okay with you?
Where’s your home?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.840
The other way.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.840
Then don’t bother.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.840
I don’t mind.
I also want to talk with you.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.010
And I would always use this path
to the Academy to pick up my little sister.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.640
I loved this path.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.800
What? You loved?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.840
Yeah. In the battle when the Leaf
was attacked at night one year ago,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.220
my little sister was…

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.840
This man…is the same as me.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.840
Tomorrow’s mission will be
within enemy lines…

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.430
Fighting and losing cherished people
is not the only way for a Shinobi.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.720
Uh-huh.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.890
I’m living in a world of Shinobi
where death always hovers.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:21.510
I want to risk my life to bring
this war-torn world under control.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.680
I love this village and my comrades.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.220
So I want to protect them.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.100
Since my little sister died,
that sole thought has sustained me.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.890
So I’ll become the Hokage…

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.890
An existence that protects everyone…

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.470
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.510
Dan…

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.470
I’d like you…to take this.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.510
Hang on, Dan!

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.840
Tsunade… I don’t want…to die yet.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.260
I have many things that I must…do.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:22.680
Don’t talk, Dan!

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.140
His kidney has been blown out…

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.930
It’s futile even for Tsunade
who is known as one of the Sannin…

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.720
I…must not…die here.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.680
It’ll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.970
So it’ll be okay… You’ll be saved, Dan!

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.140
Really?

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.470
Thank goodness…

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.840
Dan! Hang on!

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.180
Dan!

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.550
Dang it! Don’t come out…

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.840
Stop… Please stop!

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.010
Stop… Stop…

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.550
Stop… Stop…

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.470
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.260
Stop, I say!

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.840
That’s enough. He’s dead!

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.050
You understand, don’t you, Naruto…?

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.640
Ever since that day,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.640
Lady Tsunade has been…
in a constant turmoil.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.100
Naruto…?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.180
I’m heading out…for training!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.640
Oh, you are already at it, I see!

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.720
Hi, welcome!

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.840
Why are you here?

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.300
You’re cold. Don’t say that.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.760
Master Jiraiya…

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.550
Shizune, could you leave us?

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.600
It's been a while.
I want to drink with her again.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.390
Master, sake! And some radish!

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.100
Coming up!

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.510
I’m counting on you, Master Jiraiya.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.970
Your radish is ready.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.850
Ooh. This looks good.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.840
At any rate, to think you’d still be taking
good care of that necklace…

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.840
I thought you’d have lost it
long since to gambling.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.430
It’s a memento of those two, right?

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.840
Is he on your mind…?

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.010
Who?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.640
Naruto.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:43.840
Not particularly…

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.350
Still, it’s immature,
taking on that kid as an opponent…

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.840
He shouldn’t be able to master
that Jutsu in a week, right?

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.840
That’s not what’s called a bet.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.840
What’s with the fit of despair?

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.840
It’s not a fit of despair!

00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.840
Are you going to meet
Orochimaru again?

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.720
I can tell by looking at Shizune’s face.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.890
I don’t know what kind of deal
he proposed,

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:18.850
but don’t rush to a decision.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.260
And…let me just tell you one thing.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.220
The successive line of Hokages
have protected

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.550
the Leaf Village and those living in it.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.050
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.720
They risked their lives
for this dream, this ideal!

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.050
You're not someone who can't understand
the feelings of the previous Hokages.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.640
Just try doing something
to betray the Leaf Village.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.470
When that happens, I’ll kill you myself!

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.470
It has nothing to do with me now!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.010
A person who has experienced
the death of people close to them

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.220
and doesn’t feel anything
is just a butcher.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.430
You’re different, aren’t you?

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:13.260
No one cared for the welfare
of the villagers more than you.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.390
At that time, too…

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.600
That’s enough with the lecture!

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.140
Why…did you bring that kid?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.260
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.050
He resembles him, doesn’t he?

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.720
His age is about the same, too…

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.010
Not just that…

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.100
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.850
Geez, you do nothing,
but reckless things.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.050
Do you want to die?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.640
You’re still a Genin,
so on the battlefield just run away.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.350
Don’t tell a man to “run away”!

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.840
That dream… And his cockiness as well…

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.390
No good! Dang it! Dang it!
Tomorrow, for sure…!

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.260
My head hurts.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.840
I totally got sick from drinking,
thanks to her…

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:40.470
It seems Naruto never came home
last night…

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.510
He's such a fool.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.640
Why don’t we make a deal?

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.850
I’ll resurrect the little brother
and man, both of whom you loved…

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.890
with the Forbidden Jutsu I’ve developed.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.300
Don’t you want to see those two,
Tsunade?

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.510
If I treat your arms…

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.760
What do you intend to do with them?

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.840
This time, I will completely
destroy Leaf Village!

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.930
No! You must not believe
in their sweet talk…

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.010
Their wishes…

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.350
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes…
And dreams… Did you forget them ?!

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.970
I’ll be straight with you.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.220
Tsunade, the village has demanded
that you become the Fifth Hokage.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:23.010
I believe your promise,
its a true heart give me courage

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.510
Always I feel it
the precious time with you

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.680
On your still shoulder

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.300
I feel the wind that blows
towards tomorrow

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.840
The city lights are like pieces of stars

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.800
That hold us together

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:57.430
“Each one of us glows differently,”

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.010
you say laughingly

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.970
but you look most dazzling

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.890
Like a comet,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:17.100
like the rainbow after the storm

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:24.300
You bring light into my heart

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:34.760
Being lost can be the answer

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:43.600
Let’s promise we won’t cheat

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.680
Uh... like a shooting star,
we do go ahead.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.510
Darn it! What am I doing?!

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.840
I fell asleep at such
an important time!

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.100
Moreover, today is the day
of the bet!

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.930
Meanwhile, I don't even know where
that old lady Tsunade has gone to!

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.890
My training is not completed yet…

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.140
I've got to play it by ear
and rely on a one-shot deal!

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.680
Next time: "A Dubious Offer!
Tsunade's Choice"
