WEBVTT

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.600
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.100
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.720
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.300
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.720
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.720
Right here right now (Burn)

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.390
Down a difficult road
filled with endless struggles

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.220
Where do you think you are going
following someone else's map?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.510
An insightful crow comes along
to tear up the map

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.840
Now open your eyes and
take a look at the truth (Yeah!)

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.180
There's nothing to lose,
so let's GO!!!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.760
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.350
Fighting Dreamers
don't care what people think about them

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
Fighting Dreamers
follow what they believe

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.470
Oli Oli Oli Oh!
Just go my way

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.050
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.760
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.350
Right here right now (Bang)
Hit it straight like a line drive!

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.550
Right here right now (Burn)
We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840
What’s the matter?

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.970
After pursuing me like that,
what’s up with you?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.430
You’re not even able to touch me…

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.470
What a laugh!

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.260
Sakura…

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.510
I don’t know how far I can go, but…

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.050
I have to give it…my best shot!

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.840
Naruto’s Ninja Handbook

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.760
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.680
Here goes!

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.300
From this moment on,
Secret Ultimate Taijutsu technique!

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.760
Naruto Uzumaki…
Clone Body Slam!

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.840
– Now! 					– Now!

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.050
Okay!

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.840
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.100
Once again…
Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.840
Take this!

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.850
Leaf Village Secret Ultimate
Taijutsu technique

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.550
learned from Kakashi Sensei!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.850
A Thousand Years of Death!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.010
An enema?

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.350
Boom.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.430
Sasuke…?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.840
That was a splendid blow.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930
D-Did that get him?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.600
Gaara…

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.840
Doing all that work…
And managing just one blow, huh?

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.260
S-Shut up!

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.760
He attacked the base of the tail
which has the weakest defense…

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.180
Even though I’m not wounded,
I can’t absorb the impact.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.600
Did I underestimate him too much?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.890
Hey, Naruto…

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.100
Sakura… Go rescue her
if it’s the last thing you do!

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.800
And after you’ve rescued her…

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.850
take Sakura and
lose no time in fleeing.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.550
You, if anyone, can do it!

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.840
Sasuke… You…

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.890
I still have the ability…
to hold him in check for a while.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.350
If things end here…

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.850
it would just mean that
was the extent of the man I am.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.140
I lost everything once…

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.840
I don’t want to see…

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.930
any precious comrades die
right before my eyes again.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.970
Precious…comrades…

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.840
I will not allow my comrades…

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.470
to be killed, no matter what.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.100
I see…

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.890
That’s right.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.470
Because he resembles me…

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.720
Because he has gone through life

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.220
with the same loneliness
and sadness as I have…

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.600
That guy who continued to fight
in solitude for himself,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.840
I thought…he was strong.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840
Naruto…

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.840
But that’s not the meaning
of true strength…

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.840
If one fights just for
oneself in solitude…

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.840
one can’t really become strong…

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.800
Is there someone who
is precious to you?

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.680
When a person wants to protect
someone who is precious to him…

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.350
it’s then that they truly…
become…strong.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.760
You will…become strong.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.260
He’s releasing such
massive amount of Chakra!

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.850
That’s…Naruto?!

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.350
No matter what, I will…

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.680
protect you!

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.850
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.300
He’s pretty good, this one.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.140
I’ve kept you waiting
a long time!

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.840
The spiraling series of Naruto Uzumaki’s
Ninja Handbook starts now!

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.840
W-What’s up with this…
large number of clones?!

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.840
What the heck is this?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.510
T-This is…amazing!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.840
You are pretty promising.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
You… This is…

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.840
Sasuke, you get yourself
a good rest.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.100
Leave the rest to Naruto Uzumaki!

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.390
This guy is…

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:46.220
All right! Everyone! Here I go!

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.050
that Naruto?!

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.550
Jump!

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.640
Naruto’s…Ninja…Handbook!

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.260
Everywhere…

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.140
Shuriken!

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.010
My body hasn’t fully recovered…

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.220
My only choice is to
use Sand as a defense!

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.840
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki…!
– Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki…!

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.300
– Barrage! 					– Barrage!

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.470
T-This guy…!

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.350
– This time, I’ll use both legs…
– This time, I’ll use both legs…

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.550
– and go for a 4K Barrage!
– and go for a 4K Barrage!

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.600
Who the heck is that…?
Suddenly…

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.970
Unbelievable…
To get Gaara in that state…

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.840
Where does that strength come from?

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.720
No way! 					There's no way…

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.010
No way I’ll…lose to…a guy like this…!

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.100
W-What’s…that?

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.890
It finally…emerged.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.100
The Perfect Possession!

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.840
This is…
the monster inside that guy.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.220
I didn’t think you would
expose this form!

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.510
Naruto!

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.890
Darn…my body…!

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:34.220
My Chakra has…
with all those clones earlier on…

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.010
Sakura!

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.550
D-Darn…!

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.140
I, Inu, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji…

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.350
This will mark your end…

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.510
– Sand Burial!
– Summoning Jutsu!

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.350
It’s amazing that he can utilize
a Summoning Jutsu in that state…

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.840
I will protect…

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.840
Sakura!

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.840
Naruto Uzumaki…

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.350
You continue to give me
such pleasure…

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.840
Naruto… 					What in the…world…?

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.720
My hours of practice
are finally paying off!

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.100
I can do it!

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.600
– What is this? 					– Huh?

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.350
Not you again!
What in the world do you want?

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.260
Huh?!

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.010
That must be…
the Shukaku of the Sand.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.470
Chief Toad!
Come join me in this fight!

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.840
No way!

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.050
What?!

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.300
Why would I go out of my way
and fight a guy like that?

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.550
That’s idiotic!

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.840
Why?!

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.890
You told me the other day that you
would make me your henchman!

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.430
It’s only natural for a chief
to help out his henchman!

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.600
That’s respect and duty, right?!

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.850
It’s true I told you
I’d make you my henchman…

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.010
But we haven’t even exchanged
cups of sake to seal our relationship yet…

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:47.840
Gimme a break! I’m still underage!

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.430
I can’t drink alcohol!

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.840
Don’t say that and just listen
to what this guy says, Pop!

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.430
Huh?! Pop?!

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.840
Why are you here, Gamakichi?

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.640
I had lots of time on my hands,
so I came to visit…

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.510
Huh? Huh?
You’re father and son?

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.840
Then that guy over there
tried to bully me!

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.930
What was that?!

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.890
When that happened,
this guy here rescued me…

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.600
He clashed with that monster…

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.430
Pretty interesting guy.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.010
I see…

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.010
Kid… I recognize you
as my henchman…

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.800
and I’ll show you what duty
and respect means!

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:04.840
I’ll make you pay the price
good and proper, you underling!

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.350
Hang on tight!

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.430
How’s that?!

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.050
Awesome…

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.430
What a guy…

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.840
He’s so heavy,

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.220
I could barely manage to
thrust my dagger through him.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.680
If I don’t hurry up,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.840
this battle will change
the shape of the landscape.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.430
Hey! Hey! Chief!

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.840
Sakura is over that way,
so don’t move that way!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.100
Please lure him in this direction.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.350
Sakura…?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.430
That’s his girlfriend, Pop.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.600
I’ve got to take that guy down.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.050
Otherwise, I won’t be able
to rescue Sakura!

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.970
Interesting!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.800
This is interesting!
Naruto Uzumaki!

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.970
T-This isn’t good!

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.100
That Gaara…
He’s intending to do that thing.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.840
I better get out of here!

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.550
Huh…? That is…

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.220
That’s…the medium…?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:00.510
To thank you for entertaining me
up to now…

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.390
I’ll show you the real power…

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.390
of the Sand Spirit!

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.300
The circles under his eyes…

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:14.470
Those are symptoms of
insomnia which indicate

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.970
that the medium is also possessed
by the Shukaku of the Sand.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.430
Insomnia…?

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.720
Those who are possessed
by the Demon Raccoon Shukaku

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.140
are unable to sleep soundly
through the entire night.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.550
Because of the terror…

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:39.890
If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowly
eat away at their personality

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.890
and eventually that person
is no longer himself.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.430
Because he normally
doesn’t get much sleep…

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:55.850
the medium’s personality
tends to…become unstable.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.050
Oh…

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.430
Therefore, usually while
the medium is awake,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.510
the power of Shukaku is
normally controlled.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.840
However…

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.840
when that medium sleeps…

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.470
Playing Possum Jutsu!

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.180
He’s done it…!

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.470
W-What’s gonna happen, Chief?

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.010
If one sets Playing Possum Jutsu
into motion…

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.550
…the Shukaku will appear!

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.180
I’m finally able to emerge!

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.010
That’s the Shukaku?

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:00.550
He’s pretty funky…

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.760
Right away!
The guy I wanna kill! You!

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:09.970
I’m gonna jump…

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.850
Huh?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.300
Wind Style: Air Bullets!

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.640
Water Style: Water Bullets!

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.350
That’s practically a storm…

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.390
What kind of a battle is this…?!

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.970
Chief! I told you,
not in that direction!

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.010
Shut up! I know!

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.180
Air Bullets!

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.430
Water Bullets!

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.430
Too bad…

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.680
This isn’t good, Chief!
There's one shot left…!

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.680
Yeah! I killed it…

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.300
I killed it!

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.510
That hurts…!

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.640
How dare you shoot me

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.890
with bullets containing
stupid amounts of Chakra!

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.640
Even I can’t take that many shots!

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.470
What should we do?!

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.720
For a start,
wake up that medium kid!

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.390
It will release that Jutsu!

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.970
How do we go about waking him?!

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.970
Give him a good punch!

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.140
Water Bullets!

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.550
Like I’ll take that!

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.350
Now!

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.640
Chief, I can’t hit him
unless you hold him down!

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:05.430
This Toad doesn’t have fangs or claws
to hold that guy’s movement.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.100
What should we do then?!

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:12.510
We’ll use the Transform Jutsu to
change into something that has those!

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.640
But with that said…

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.550
I’m not particularly good
at transformations.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.220
Huh?

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:24.470
So you will act as my will
and make the Sign!

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:25.840
Whaaaat?!

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.720
Time for a combined transformation!

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.100
Uh…Okay!

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.640
We got to have fangs and claws!

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.350
Umm…

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.600
Let’s go!

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.840
Wait…
Say, w-wait a second…!

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.300
F- Fangs and claws… Fangs and claws…
Fangs and claws!

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.470
Transform!

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.930
Transform Jutsu!

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.140
That’s the…!

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.720
A cycle of hardship, right?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.680
Inside, we were crying, right?

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:39.930
But the one thing we won't give up
is the dream we've chosen, right?

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.850
It's a secondary role,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.840
a role in the shadows

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.390
But in reaching for that dream,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:59.890
let us stay centered,
let us stay true

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.850
Over and over,
we hung on without giving up

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.840
Over and over,
we kept coming back up

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:19.100
Over and over,
we believed and dreamed

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.840
I don’t know about your past,
and my past doesn’t matter either!

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.350
I only have people who I must protect.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.010
Hey you with no eyebrows!

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.840
Let’s just end this as similar fighters.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.850
I will finish this with my next hit.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.890
This will be, absolutely and totally,
the last one!

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.390
Next time:
“Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light”
