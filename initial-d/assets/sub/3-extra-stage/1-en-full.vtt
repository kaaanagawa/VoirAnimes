00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.890
Mako, that cornering wasn't tight enough!

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.590
You would normally choose a tighter line.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.430
You were off by five inches.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.360
Uh, yeah...

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.860
Someone is coming down the pass.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.080
--That's Mako's Sileighty!
--So cool.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.520
That's Usui's fastest Sileighty, "Impact Blue"!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.190
Not good!

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.570
This isn't like you! Try to concentrate.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.630
What's the matter?

"Beyond Impact Blue..."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.170
So, that's what happened.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.640
You got dumped by that Iketani guy, then.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.170
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.180
No wonder you were driving so weird!

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.180
You're the type whose
driving reflects your feelings.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.310
You race with your emotions.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.610
What's wrong with you?!

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.950
Listen, Iketani!

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
Being in love means that you
accept everything about the person.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.560
Just hurry up and go meet her now!

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.460
I'll lecture you later!

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.140
I'll be waiting for you

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.710
under that billboard where we first met.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.020
<i>The boss is right.</i>

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.020
<i>Mako was always honest with me... but I...</i>

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.020
<i>I'm certifiable!</i>

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.030
My feet hurt.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.760
I hate high heels.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.530
<i>Please, God, I just need one more chance!</i>

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.180
<i>Traffic?!</i>

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.940
I'll never wear high heels again.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.490
I just can't see how anyone
could break up with you.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.050
He looked like he was
head over heels for you.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Maybe there was a misunderstanding.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.170
I thought so, too, so I kept on
waiting for him after that...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.070
But he never called you?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.940
Right.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940
Why don't you call him?

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.110
I can't be that pushy.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.850
I waited there for three extra hours.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.520
The fact that he hasn't called

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.510
means that he's not interested in me.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.530
I guess you really liked him, huh?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.930
Enough to affect your
driving abilities, anyway.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.670
Yeah. I would've given it to him.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.430
Given what?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.040
My virginity.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.520
I just can't tell if you're naive or bold, really!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.890
Anyway, what was so special about him?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.730
It's hard to explain.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.360
He was sincere and gentle.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.000
When we talked about cars,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.410
we got really into it, and time just flew by.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.680
Hello?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.320
Shingo! Long time no talk. How are you?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.820
I'm good.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.390
The reason I called you is...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.160
What? Really?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.720
The Lan-Evo Squad was in Myogi?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.740
Did you hear the news, brother?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.040
Lan-Evos with Tochigi plates
showed up in Myogi, too.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.010
I see.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.280
I hear the Night Kids lost badly.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.440
That idiot Nakazato had
to lose to those outsiders.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.760
I know who they are.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.260
Kyoichi Sudo is their leader.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.700
He's a racer from the Nikko Irohazaka course.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.530
What?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.240
<i>Kyoichi...</i>

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.860
<i>What are you plotting now?</i>

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.150
--It's been a while, Shingo.
--Yeah.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.450
Anyway, you Night Kids are pretty pathetic.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.320
That's a nice way to greet us.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.550
This is Sayuki. We grew up together.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.450
Hi.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.330
<i>She's cute!</i>

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.570
He's the one who raced them.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.340
This is Nakazato.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.510
Nice to meet you.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.600
How could you lose to
them on your home turf?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.850
<i>I'll protect Gunma.</i>

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.510
<i>I'll bury your evil plan deep in Myogi's ravine!</i>

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.290
What?!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.150
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.450
<i>But it's not over yet!</i>

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.790
If I don't stop them...

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.350
...who will?!

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.560
They're a Lan-Evo team called the Emperors.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.900
It was right after Takeshi lost to
the Red Suns in an uphill race,

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.400
and he hadn't gotten over it yet.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.940
--You were out of sync.
--I guess.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.180
He's inconsistent and doesn't
do well under pressure.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.180
Why don't you stop talking now?

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.580
But nobody else can drive an R32 like he can.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.290
I'd say he's the best R32 racer around here.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.960
But even he couldn't keep up,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.230
which means that Lan-Evo is fast.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.370
They said they would wipe out
all of Gunma in one month.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.700
They'll be here, too.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.440
Be careful, Sayuki.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.740
Myogi and Usui are very close together.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.210
Oh, yeah? That's more like it.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:06.720
People don't call us "Impact Blue,
Usui's fastest" for nothing.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.760
<i>She's aggressive.</i>

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.260
I'm just trying to help you.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.590
You're better off avoiding them.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.430
What do you mean by that, Shingo?

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.160
Are you saying we have no chance at all?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.170
I didn't say that!

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.970
<i>Bouncy!</i>

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.020
Don't underestimate us girls!

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.280
We don't back down from anyone!

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.690
Amazing...

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.690
Is that all?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.490
I'm leaving, then.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.300
She's just so stubborn.
Don't come crying to me!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.610
Hey, Takeshi, I brought you here

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.510
because I wanted her to know
how dangerous the Emperors are.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.280
You could've helped.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.980
Are you listening to me, Takeshi?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.110
Bouncy... Amazing.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.460
Anyway, I hear a Lan-Evo
team called the Emperors

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.570
is attacking Gunma.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.200
I've heard that, too.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.870
--Everyone's talking about them.
--Yeah.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.040
I heard they cut the Night Kids' sticker in half

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.540
and put it upside down
on one of their spoilers.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.250
Who would do such a thing?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.250
Are they really coming here, too?

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.250
What will you do if they come, Sayuki?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.820
That's a stupid question.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.320
Isn't that right, Mako?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.090
Right. We'll take anyone's challenge

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.260
because we're Usui's fastest, "Impact Blue."

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.370
That's how we feel, so help us out, okay?

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.870
The moment you see their Lan-Evos,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.370
call me on my cell phone.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.040
Yeah.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.560
<i>It's been two days, but the Lan-Evo</i>
<i>Squad hasn't shown up yet.</i>

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.100
<i>Maybe they're not coming to Usui.</i>

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.370
<i>Part of me will feel relieved if they don't.</i>

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.780
<i>I haven't been at the top of my game lately.</i>

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.780
<i>If I had to face them right now,</i>

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.380
<i>I'm not sure I could run my best race.</i>

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.170
<i>But I do want to clear this haze from my mind.</i>

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.260
<i>I want to forget about Iketani.</i>

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.940
Come on!!

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.610
Sayuki?!

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.020
What are you doing in my bathroom?!

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.650
This isn't the time for a relaxing bath, Mako!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.360
What's going on?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.860
I came to pick you up! We're going.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.590
Going where?

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.260
To Usui Pass!

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.700
Those Lan-Evos are here!

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.970
Just hurry up and put on your underwear.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.670
Just give me a second!

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.540
This is embarrassing!

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.130
Here come the Lan-Evos!

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.740
It's the Emperors, all right. They really came.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.970
--Did you call Sayuki and Mako?
--Yeah.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.050
What? The Lan-Evos are there?

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.660
Yeah, the Emperor guys you told me about.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.860
We're on our way there.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.000
Got it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.550
Takeshi!

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.570
The Lan-Evo Squad showed up in Usui.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.700
They did?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.570
Let's go, Takeshi.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.170
Yeah.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.560
I see nothing but FR drift punks here, too.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.530
I must say that Gunma's level is pretty low.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.370
Let's go back and tell Kyoichi about this.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.930
Yeah.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.440
Hey, guys...

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.340
If you're here to race,
we'll take your challenge,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.780
'cause our Sileighty is the fastest car around.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.820
Hey, Shingo...

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.690
Is anything going on between
you and that Sileighty girl?

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.930
You mean Sayuki?

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.270
We're just childhood friends, that's all.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:31.170
We lived close to each other
and went to the same school.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.180
--I see.
--Yeah.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.850
Wait a minute, Takeshi.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.180
You like girls like that?

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.380
Well...

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.690
You don't want her.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.480
She's a strong-minded rebel.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.960
She's not the kind of girl
who listens to anyone's advice,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.530
but even if they are the fastest in Usui,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.160
they have no chance against those Lan-Evos.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.540
I admit that their drifting
technique is amazing.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.380
Maybe no one in Usui could touch them,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.550
but they have almost no
experience with pure speed racing--

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.680
the kind that requires remarkable control.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.820
I must say their control isn't crisp enough.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.350
They'll be outclassed by a serious 4WD car.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.360
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Takeshi.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.600
I don't mean to say that they're
slow just because they're girls,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.700
but they have no chance.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.510
A Sileighty, huh?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.910
With girl drivers.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.690
Let's play a little, 'cause this looks fun.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.790
Hey, I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.630
We're just scouting.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.560
You may get yelled at by Kyoichi later.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.730
Don't be such a tight-ass!

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.570
We came all the way here.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.410
I see no harm in having a little fun.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.570
As long as I win.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.440
But what if you lose to them?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.550
Don't insult me with your "what ifs," Ren.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.380
How could my Evo IV

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.220
lose to these bimbo drivers?

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.390
Hear that, Mako? That does it.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.560
He shouldn't have said that.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.100
People who insult girl racers are the worst.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.930
Fine, I won't go easy on you.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.910
<i>Her eyes are getting serious.</i>

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.080
<i>She's fast when she looks like that,</i>

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.480
<i>'cause her emotion is the fuel.</i>

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.460
This is a downhill race.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.460
Since Usui Pass is narrow,
it'll be a "cat and mouse" race.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.970
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.500
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.310
Are you okay with that?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.970
That's fine.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.680
Then go ahead and choose
which position you want first.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680
I'll follow you first...

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.180
...so I can check out your behind.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.890
Let's start, then.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.560
After exiting the first corner,
we'll go full speed.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.490
That's the start of the race. Got it?

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.550
Yeah, okay.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.240
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.540
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.910
I'm one of the top racers in the Emperors.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.380
I'm 200% sure that my Evo IV

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.510
won't lose to a Sileighty driven by two girls.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.020
Let's go!

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.830
I refuse to lose to a guy
who insults girl racers.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.200
Mako, you look fired up.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.840
Are you ready, Sayuki?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.530
Okay.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.900
An easy win.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.300
His Evo IV can't possibly lose to a Sileighty.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.900
They're really doing it.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.580
When it counts, women have more courage.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.410
Can they defeat the Emperors,
who defeated the Night Kids?

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.880
That Evo IV is a high-powered 4WD car.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.290
Anyone else would've run away.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.160
But if Sayuki and Mako can't beat that guy,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.960
no one else can.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.990
Right. I don't know who
named them "Impact Blue,"

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.930
but they're Usui's fastest.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.670
All we can do is believe in them,
because Sayuki's blue Sileighty

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.600
is the best here.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.350
They're not bad.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.450
This is their course, so they
know how to attack it.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.860
No cars ahead. Drift right through here!

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.110
<i>My Evo I V's drift is far better</i>
<i>than an FR's pitiful drift.</i>

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.940
<i>It's a high-speed 4WD drift</i>

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.000
<i>with the engine full blast!</i>

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.330
Mako, you're doing great.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.160
Grip the next corner and hug the inner wall!

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.340
We're about even so far.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.380
I'm not sure if it's the Evo IV itself

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.210
or the driver's technique that's
letting him keep up with us.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.350
Like you said,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.320
swinging drift involves many variables.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.330
It all depends on how you use the tires.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.730
Yeah.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.700
When was the last time
you saw this Sileighty race?

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.700
Sometime last spring.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.260
Then she may have changed.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.110
I've experienced it, too.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.610
After a painful loss,

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.280
a talented racer can change big-time.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.050
Yeah.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.850
There are talented FR racers

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.920
like Akina's Eight-Six in this world.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.360
There is an FR racer who can beat a 4WD car.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.860
But that Eight-Six is an exception.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.530
I guess it would've been a different story

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.730
if those girls had ever had a
chance to see that Eight-Six race.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.220
Hmph, insolent chick drivers!

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.210
<i>I won't lose, no matter what!</i>

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.060
<i>Amazing! Her driving is totally different.</i>

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.220
<i>Her steering has definitely gotten tighter.</i>

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240
<i>Her driving probably got this way</i>

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.610
<i>after the race against Akina's Eight-Six.</i>

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.190
<i>Mako has woken up!</i>

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.590
<i>You're amazing, Mako! We can win this race!</i>

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.440
<i>That Evo I Visn't as sharp at the corners.</i>

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.990
<i>He's not as great as I thought he was.</i>

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.950
<i>He's probably not the one who</i>
<i>defeated the Night Kids in Myogi.</i>

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.800
<i>In that case, I hate to keep</i>
<i>showing him our behinds.</i>

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.360
We'll finish him at the next corner, C-121!

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.300
I know you know this,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.040
but you're much faster on
the straightaways tonight.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.380
You'll be entering the
corner at a higher speed,

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.040
so don't forget to adjust for that!

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.590
Good, no cars ahead. Go!

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.930
If those girls can clear this corner,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.530
my Evo IV certainly can!

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.290
<i>I'm going wide!</i>

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.190
<i>I can't stay on the same line!</i>

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.880
It's over, Mako.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.330
Hey, are you okay?

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.730
Yeah.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:29:00.170
Hey, don't tell Kyoichi
anything about this, okay?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.790
Sure.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.680
Sayuki, where's the Lan-Evo Squad?

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.490
You're late, Shingo.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.860
We're already done.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.360
What? It's over?

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.700
I see. Don't be discouraged.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.300
We lost on our home turf, too.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.210
What are you talking about?!

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.970
We won.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.510
I said we won.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.540
They won?!

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.320
Mako was amazing.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.030
She's a genius.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.720
Don't tease.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.230
Let's go home.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.160
See ya, Shingo.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.010
Hey, we came out here to root for you.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.890
That Sileighty is giving off a blinding aura.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.020
They're the real thing!

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.940
You're amazing, Mako.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.250
Maybe last night's Lan-Evo wasn't that good.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.580
That's not true.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.750
He was pretty good.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.590
It would've been a tough race

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.360
had we raced him before
we raced Akina's Eight-Six.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.600
Less-angled cornering has
been our focus since our loss,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.120
and you executed it perfectly.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.040
But at C-121, when we went for the kill,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.280
you went back to your flashy, dramatic drift.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.050
I guess I entered that corner way too fast.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.040
I get scared thinking about it now.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.560
It wasn't funny last night.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.490
I thought I was gonna die.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.330
You sure are an emotional racer.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.420
You suddenly change into someone else.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.900
I feel kind of relieved now.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.650
But I still have a long way to go.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.520
I feel like I'm chasing after something
that's beyond that blue sky.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.020
I don't need a man for a while.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.350
Just watch me, Iketani!

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.690
Bang!

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.200
Have you caught a cold, Iketani?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.970
No, I don't think so.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.800 line:50 %
"Early Autumn: Crispy Autumn"

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.160
You're wobbling a little.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.490
I can't help it.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.000
Yesterday's snow is frozen on the road.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.260
I guess studless tires don't cut it.

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.640
What?!

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:04.680
What's up with that car?
It had studless tires, too.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.320
Unbelievable.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.930
Watch out! Watch it! Oh, no!

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.270
Not again! Go right, right!

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.710
Oh, no... Ouch!

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.610
- Sayuki?
- That hurt!

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.120
This snow is frozen solid.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.810
You okay, Sayuki?

"Sentimental White"

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.070
This is so annoying.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.140
We started snowboarding at the same time,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.840
so why are you so good at it already?

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.920
I hate to admit it,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.020
but other girls don't have your athletic talent.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.760
It was the same when you
were learning how to drift.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.850
You have great intuition
and develop so quickly.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.330
It's Shingo!

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.740
Oh, Sayuki?

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.070
Long time no see!

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.070
What a coincidence to run into you here!

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.510
I never knew you snowboarded.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.080
Yeah, sure!

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.050
Oh, really?

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.520
I know how to snowboard!

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.890
And Shingo always had

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:55.560
snot dripping from his nose
in elementary school!

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.890
Shut up!

00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:59.600
Everyone teased him by
calling him "Drippy-Nose Shingo,"

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.100
so he turned bad and became a rebel racer!

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.640
Don't make stuff up, Sayuki!

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.230
I just had a cold that day. That's all.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.450
Hey, Mako, don't you wanna
snowboard some more?

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.780
- What?
- Go right ahead.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:21.450
I'll be talking to Shingo
about the good old days.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.440
Hey, why don't you go with her?

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.490
Okay.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.100
Thank you.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.820
No problem.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.500
What do you think of him?

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.340
He looks wimpy,

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.940
but he seems pretty normal
for a friend of yours.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.940
How's his driving?

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.480
He's one of the faster
drivers of the Night Kids.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.350
Of course, he's not nearly as fast
as "Impact Blue," Usui's fastest.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.590
Anyway, she's too cute
not to have a boyfriend.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.800
You should've set me up with her instead.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.630
Don't be stupid!
You're not good enough for her.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:09.970
By the way,

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:13.170
don't let them find out that
this is a blind date, okay?

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.840
She would kill me if she knew.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.680
Don't worry.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.010
By the way, what about you, Sayuki?

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:23.450
What?

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.450
Nakazato from the other night.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.820
I think he has a crush on you.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.340
You're good. When did
you start snowboarding?

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.010
- Last year.
- That's amazing.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:01.720
Very few girls could go
that fast on this hard snow.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.260
It's exciting and a lot of fun.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.420
When I get into something,
I'm totally focused.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.280
So, Mako, what do you
think of Shingo's friend?

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.610
I don't know.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:34.290
He's pleasant, and seems
like the serious type.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:37.590
- Is that it?
- What do you mean, is that it?

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.290
I just met him, so I don't really know.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:42.930
<i>Aha!</i>

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.760
<i>I sense some chemistry between them.</i>

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.100
By the way,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.100
I heard something interesting the other day.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.600
Ryosuke Takahashi of the
Red Suns is recruiting racers,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.380
including Akina's Eight-Six,
to build a new team.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.970
I hear it'll be a special traveling team.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:06.580
Is that true, Sayuki?

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.920
I admire them for thinking
of a concept like that.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.120
They never stay in one place.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.490
They always keep moving forward.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.460
They're so awesome that I almost hate them.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.760
They truly have charisma.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.640
I wish I could see Takumi again.

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:30.810
I wonder how he's doing.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.450
I bet he looks handsome.

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:36.580
I'm never wrong about things like that.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.850
Yeah, sure, Sayuki.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:44.460
Oh, man, I'm getting kind of fired up.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.830
Anyway, the road on the way here

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.990
looked kind of nice.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:53.500
There's no snow down at the bottom.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.870
I was thinking the same thing.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.470
Wanna check it out later?

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.440
God, we love racing, don't we?

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.670
Yeah.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.380
I'm so bored.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.480
The pass is snowy.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.780
Keisuke...

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:16.880
Those who conquer winter conquer summer.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.230
Our project won't start until this spring.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.900
But we won't make any progress

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.900
if we just sit around all winter.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.830
Go drive on the snowy road.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.140
What?

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:35.140
Just clear your mind and drive
on the slippery, frozen road,

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.200
day in and day out.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.410
You'll see the effect in the spring,

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:47.250
when you change back to high-grip tires.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.920
Your senses will be sharper,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.910
and your driving skills
will be dramatically refined.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.490
Keisuke...

00:39:55.490 --> 00:40:00.160
We'll create a new
unbeatable record at each pass

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.830
and build our legend.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.830
Yeah.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.840
The snow is not a handicap.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.710
It's your best training partner.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:12.210
Racers don't have an off season.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.770
Right.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.420
Studless tires don't grip as much.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.860
But this is good training.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:32.630
A corner is there, so you attack it.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.060
That's the racer's instinct.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.770
What's up with that car?!

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.470
That was a Sileighty.
Where did it come from?

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:49.440
Wow, the driver is very skilled!

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.250
How is it?

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.890
These are all one-pattern, mid-speed corners,

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.490
so it's boring.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.890
I like Usui Pass the best.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.100
Hello?

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.430
Hey, Shingo, what's up?

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.770
What?

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.580
They've been seeing each other?

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.250
Yeah, he was all excited.

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.180
I think they have a date today.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:26.740
Oh, really? I had no idea.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.790
That's good. Christmas is coming up soon.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.520
Yeah. Talk to you later.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.630
<i>I wonder if Mako's many</i>
<i>years without a boyfriend</i>

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.100
<i>are finally coming to an end.</i>

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:52.040
I think this SW20 is a very good car.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.450
A two-seater is fun, but it's inconvenient.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.190
I'm thinking of buying something
more practical next time.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.990
Maybe a 4WD wagon.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:07.220
Are you quitting racing?

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.190
I think so, yeah.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:21.040
I'm not making any excuses,
but I think I've had enough fun.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.240
When you're a beginner,
you just try your hardest,

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.700
and it's exciting to see yourself progress.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:34.020
But when you get to a certain level,
you kind of see your limits.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.920
You stop having goals and become less eager.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:45.400
I guess that's how everyone grows out of it.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.870
Well... I really don't think
one's goals disappear that easily.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:52.370
Oh, yeah?

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:57.510
There was a time when I thought
I would quit racing by this summer.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.380
But I had an opportunity to see

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.180
a much higher-level racer,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.620
and I realized that there's much more to it.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:12.260
I don't think I could be that stoic,

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.750
because I'm not trying to be a pro racer.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.540
I'd like you to quit racing,
too, if that's possible.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:43.320
It's very dangerous to race at a pass.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.560
You're a girl, after all,

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.090
and what if you got into an accident?

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:54.600
I know no one can take away
your right to do what you want.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:57.970
But if I were your boyfriend...

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:06.240
...I'd be too worried

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.270
to let you go to a pass every night.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:16.490
There're so many other fun things to do in life.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:20.620
It might suit you better to get
dressed up and go out during the day,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.590
since you're so pretty.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.610
I'm serious about this, Mako.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.270
I've never liked anyone this much.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.280
Please be my girlfriend.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.240
I...

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:21.510
I'm flattered that you feel that way.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:28.430
But we just met,

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.860
and this kind of feels too sudden.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:38.670
I'm not asking for an answer right now.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:43.840
Let's meet again in a week, on Christmas Eve.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.580
Will you think about it until then?

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:49.270
Yes.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.730
You're in a good mood.
Do you have plans for Christmas?

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.070
No, no plans!

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:10.900
How about you, Iketani?

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:11.870
Of course not!

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:12.740
Of course not!

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.570
We're lonely drivers, right, Itsuki?

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.710
- I knew it.
- I don't have plans!

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.610

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.420
What's with the serious face?

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.620
What's on your mind?

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.300
I don't want to talk about it, even to you.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.000
It's a bad habit of yours

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.300
to keep everything to yourself, you know?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.940
I have a lot on my mind,

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.240
but mostly I'm wondering what I'm racing for.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.250
I've never had a serious
conversation like this with you.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:05.090
Do you think my vaguely
wanting to be a better racer

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:07.780
might seem strange to others?

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.430
It's not strange at all.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:14.930
Did someone say something to you?

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:19.700
You're just too innocent and easily influenced.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:24.270
We are who we are,

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.440
no matter what others say about us.

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:32.380

I'm sorry to have you come
out to a place like this

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:18.700
on Christmas Eve.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.670
No, it's all right.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.700

Hold on a second!

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.540
I have no intention of racing you.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.210
That's not it.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:34.340
I want you to sit next to me.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:36.040
What?

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:48.590
<i>I usually have Sayuki sitting next to me.</i>

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:50.530
<i>This feels strange.</i>

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.760
Okay, here we go.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.100
<i>She's good... no, amazing!</i>

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.090
<i>I had no idea.</i>

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.120
You're way better than I thought you were.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.860
Very few Night Kids can drive like that.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:59.760
You may even be better
than Takeshi and Shingo.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.830
I think I understand why
you had me ride with you.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:11.500
This is your answer, isn't it?

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.180
I'm sorry.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:16.940
I thought about it long and hard.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:21.650
You may think I'm a foolish girl,

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:25.210
but I can't shake my desire for racing.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.500
I want to keep chasing after the people

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:36.400
who are running in front of me.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.470
Even if I can't catch up with them for now,

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.730
I want to keep facing the same direction.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.740
I'm so sorry.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:49.340
I really was very flattered.

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:53.410
I understand.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.420
Goodbye.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.410
<i>I don't know who they are,</i>

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:17.910
<i>but I'm so jealous</i>

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:21.670
<i>of the people she cares about right now.</i>

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.590
Hey, where's Takumi?

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:34.260
Maybe he has a date.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.030
Who knows what he's doing?

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.460
Let's have fun, just the three of us!

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.300
Yay! Merry Christmas to lonely drivers!

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.530
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
