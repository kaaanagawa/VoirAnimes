00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.890
Mako, that cornering wasn't tight enough!

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.590
You would normally choose a tighter line.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.430
You were off by five inches.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.360
Uh, yeah...

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.860
Someone is coming down the pass.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.080
--That's Mako's Sileighty!
--So cool.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.520
That's Usui's fastest Sileighty, "Impact Blue"!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.190
Not good!

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.570
This isn't like you! Try to concentrate.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.630
What's the matter?

"Beyond Impact Blue..."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.170
So, that's what happened.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.640
You got dumped by that Iketani guy, then.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.170
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.180
No wonder you were driving so weird!

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.180
You're the type whose
driving reflects your feelings.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.310
You race with your emotions.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.610
What's wrong with you?!

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.950
Listen, Iketani!

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.180
Being in love means that you
accept everything about the person.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.560
Just hurry up and go meet her now!

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.460
I'll lecture you later!

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.140
I'll be waiting for you

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.710
under that billboard where we first met.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.020
<i>The boss is right.</i>

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.020
<i>Mako was always honest with me... but I...</i>

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.020
<i>I'm certifiable!</i>

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.030
My feet hurt.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.760
I hate high heels.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.530
<i>Please, God, I just need one more chance!</i>

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.180
<i>Traffic?!</i>

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.940
I'll never wear high heels again.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.490
I just can't see how anyone
could break up with you.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.050
He looked like he was
head over heels for you.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.160
Maybe there was a misunderstanding.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:49.170
I thought so, too, so I kept on
waiting for him after that...

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.070
But he never called you?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.940
Right.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.940
Why don't you call him?

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.110
I can't be that pushy.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.850
I waited there for three extra hours.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.520
The fact that he hasn't called

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.510
means that he's not interested in me.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.530
I guess you really liked him, huh?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.930
Enough to affect your
driving abilities, anyway.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.670
Yeah. I would've given it to him.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.430
Given what?

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.040
My virginity.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.520
I just can't tell if you're naive or bold, really!

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.890
Anyway, what was so special about him?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.730
It's hard to explain.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.360
He was sincere and gentle.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.000
When we talked about cars,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.410
we got really into it, and time just flew by.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.680
Hello?

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.320
Shingo! Long time no talk. How are you?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.820
I'm good.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.390
The reason I called you is...

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.160
What? Really?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.720
The Lan-Evo Squad was in Myogi?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.740
Did you hear the news, brother?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.040
Lan-Evos with Tochigi plates
showed up in Myogi, too.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.010
I see.

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.280
I hear the Night Kids lost badly.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.440
That idiot Nakazato had
to lose to those outsiders.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.760
I know who they are.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.260
Kyoichi Sudo is their leader.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.700
He's a racer from the Nikko Irohazaka course.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.530
What?

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.240
<i>Kyoichi...</i>

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.860
<i>What are you plotting now?</i>

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.150
--It's been a while, Shingo.
--Yeah.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.450
Anyway, you Night Kids are pretty pathetic.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.320
That's a nice way to greet us.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.550
This is Sayuki. We grew up together.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.450
Hi.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.330
<i>She's cute!</i>

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.570
He's the one who raced them.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.340
This is Nakazato.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.510
Nice to meet you.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.600
How could you lose to
them on your home turf?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.850
<i>I'll protect Gunma.</i>

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.510
<i>I'll bury your evil plan deep in Myogi's ravine!</i>

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.290
What?!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.150
<i>This can't be happening!</i>

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.450
<i>But it's not over yet!</i>

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.790
If I don't stop them...

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.350
...who will?!

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.560
They're a Lan-Evo team called the Emperors.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.900
It was right after Takeshi lost to
the Red Suns in an uphill race,

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.400
and he hadn't gotten over it yet.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.940
--You were out of sync.
--I guess.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.180
He's inconsistent and doesn't
do well under pressure.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.180
Why don't you stop talking now?

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:30.580
But nobody else can drive an R32 like he can.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.290
I'd say he's the best R32 racer around here.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.960
But even he couldn't keep up,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.230
which means that Lan-Evo is fast.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.370
They said they would wipe out
all of Gunma in one month.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.700
They'll be here, too.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.440
Be careful, Sayuki.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.740
Myogi and Usui are very close together.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.210
Oh, yeah? That's more like it.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:06.720
People don't call us "Impact Blue,
Usui's fastest" for nothing.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.760
<i>She's aggressive.</i>

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.260
I'm just trying to help you.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.590
You're better off avoiding them.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.430
What do you mean by that, Shingo?

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.160
Are you saying we have no chance at all?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.170
I didn't say that!

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.970
<i>Bouncy!</i>

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.020
Don't underestimate us girls!

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.280
We don't back down from anyone!

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.690
Amazing...

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.690
Is that all?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.490
I'm leaving, then.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.300
She's just so stubborn.
Don't come crying to me!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.610
Hey, Takeshi, I brought you here

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.510
because I wanted her to know
how dangerous the Emperors are.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.280
You could've helped.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.980
Are you listening to me, Takeshi?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.110
Bouncy... Amazing.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.460
Anyway, I hear a Lan-Evo
team called the Emperors

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.570
is attacking Gunma.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.200
I've heard that, too.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.870
--Everyone's talking about them.
--Yeah.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.040
I heard they cut the Night Kids' sticker in half

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.540
and put it upside down
on one of their spoilers.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.250
Who would do such a thing?

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.250
Are they really coming here, too?

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.250
What will you do if they come, Sayuki?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.820
That's a stupid question.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.320
Isn't that right, Mako?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.090
Right. We'll take anyone's challenge

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.260
because we're Usui's fastest, "Impact Blue."

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.370
That's how we feel, so help us out, okay?

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.870
The moment you see their Lan-Evos,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:07.370
call me on my cell phone.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.040
Yeah.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.560
<i>It's been two days, but the Lan-Evo</i>
<i>Squad hasn't shown up yet.</i>

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:36.100
<i>Maybe they're not coming to Usui.</i>

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.370
<i>Part of me will feel relieved if they don't.</i>

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.780
<i>I haven't been at the top of my game lately.</i>

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.780
<i>If I had to face them right now,</i>

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.380
<i>I'm not sure I could run my best race.</i>

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:07.170
<i>But I do want to clear this haze from my mind.</i>

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.260
<i>I want to forget about Iketani.</i>

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.940
Come on!!

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.610
Sayuki?!

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.020
What are you doing in my bathroom?!

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.650
This isn't the time for a relaxing bath, Mako!

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.360
What's going on?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.860
I came to pick you up! We're going.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.590
Going where?

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.260
To Usui Pass!

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.700
Those Lan-Evos are here!

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.970
Just hurry up and put on your underwear.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.670
Just give me a second!

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.540
This is embarrassing!

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:09.130
Here come the Lan-Evos!

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.740
It's the Emperors, all right. They really came.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.970
--Did you call Sayuki and Mako?
--Yeah.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.050
What? The Lan-Evos are there?

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.660
Yeah, the Emperor guys you told me about.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.860
We're on our way there.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.000
Got it.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.550
Takeshi!

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.570
The Lan-Evo Squad showed up in Usui.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.700
They did?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.570
Let's go, Takeshi.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.170
Yeah.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.560
I see nothing but FR drift punks here, too.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.530
I must say that Gunma's level is pretty low.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.370
Let's go back and tell Kyoichi about this.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:24.930
Yeah.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.440
Hey, guys...

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.340
If you're here to race,
we'll take your challenge,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.780
'cause our Sileighty is the fastest car around.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.820
Hey, Shingo...

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.690
Is anything going on between
you and that Sileighty girl?

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.930
You mean Sayuki?

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.270
We're just childhood friends, that's all.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:31.170
We lived close to each other
and went to the same school.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.180
--I see.
--Yeah.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.850
Wait a minute, Takeshi.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.180
You like girls like that?

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.380
Well...

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.690
You don't want her.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.480
She's a strong-minded rebel.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.960
She's not the kind of girl
who listens to anyone's advice,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.530
but even if they are the fastest in Usui,

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.160
they have no chance against those Lan-Evos.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.540
I admit that their drifting
technique is amazing.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.380
Maybe no one in Usui could touch them,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.550
but they have almost no
experience with pure speed racing--

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.680
the kind that requires remarkable control.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.820
I must say their control isn't crisp enough.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.350
They'll be outclassed by a serious 4WD car.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.360
I know you know what
I'm talking about, Takeshi.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:35.600
I don't mean to say that they're
slow just because they're girls,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.700
but they have no chance.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.510
A Sileighty, huh?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.910
With girl drivers.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.690
Let's play a little, 'cause this looks fun.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.790
Hey, I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.630
We're just scouting.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.560
You may get yelled at by Kyoichi later.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.730
Don't be such a tight-ass!

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.570
We came all the way here.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.410
I see no harm in having a little fun.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.570
As long as I win.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.440
But what if you lose to them?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.550
Don't insult me with your "what ifs," Ren.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.380
How could my Evo IV

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.220
lose to these bimbo drivers?

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.390
Hear that, Mako? That does it.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.560
He shouldn't have said that.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.100
People who insult girl racers are the worst.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.930
Fine, I won't go easy on you.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.910
<i>Her eyes are getting serious.</i>

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.080
<i>She's fast when she looks like that,</i>

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.480
<i>'cause her emotion is the fuel.</i>

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.460
This is a downhill race.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.460
Since Usui Pass is narrow,
it'll be a "cat and mouse" race.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.970
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.500
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.310
Are you okay with that?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.970
That's fine.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.680
Then go ahead and choose
which position you want first.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680
I'll follow you first...

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.180
...so I can check out your behind.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.890
Let's start, then.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.560
After exiting the first corner,
we'll go full speed.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.490
That's the start of the race. Got it?

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.550
Yeah, okay.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.240
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.540
Don't make me repeat myself.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.910
I'm one of the top racers in the Emperors.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.380
I'm 200% sure that my Evo IV

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.510
won't lose to a Sileighty driven by two girls.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.020
Let's go!

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.830
I refuse to lose to a guy
who insults girl racers.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.200
Mako, you look fired up.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.840
Are you ready, Sayuki?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.530
Okay.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.900
An easy win.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.300
His Evo IV can't possibly lose to a Sileighty.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.900
They're really doing it.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.580
When it counts, women have more courage.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.410
Can they defeat the Emperors,
who defeated the Night Kids?

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.880
That Evo IV is a high-powered 4WD car.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.290
Anyone else would've run away.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.160
But if Sayuki and Mako can't beat that guy,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.960
no one else can.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.990
Right. I don't know who
named them "Impact Blue,"

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.930
but they're Usui's fastest.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.670
All we can do is believe in them,
because Sayuki's blue Sileighty

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.600
is the best here.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.350
They're not bad.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:47.450
This is their course, so they
know how to attack it.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.860
No cars ahead. Drift right through here!

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.110
<i>My Evo I V's drift is far better</i>
<i>than an FR's pitiful drift.</i>

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.940
<i>It's a high-speed 4WD drift</i>

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.000
<i>with the engine full blast!</i>

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.330
Mako, you're doing great.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.160
Grip the next corner and hug the inner wall!

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.340
We're about even so far.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.380
I'm not sure if it's the Evo IV itself

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:46.210
or the driver's technique that's
letting him keep up with us.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.350
Like you said,

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.320
swinging drift involves many variables.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.330
It all depends on how you use the tires.

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.730
Yeah.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.700
When was the last time
you saw this Sileighty race?

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.700
Sometime last spring.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.260
Then she may have changed.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.110
I've experienced it, too.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.610
After a painful loss,

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.280
a talented racer can change big-time.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.050
Yeah.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.850
There are talented FR racers

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.920
like Akina's Eight-Six in this world.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:32.360
There is an FR racer who can beat a 4WD car.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.860
But that Eight-Six is an exception.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.530
I guess it would've been a different story

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.730
if those girls had ever had a
chance to see that Eight-Six race.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.220
Hmph, insolent chick drivers!

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.210
<i>I won't lose, no matter what!</i>

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.060
<i>Amazing! Her driving is totally different.</i>

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.220
<i>Her steering has definitely gotten tighter.</i>

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.240
<i>Her driving probably got this way</i>

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.610
<i>after the race against Akina's Eight-Six.</i>

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.190
<i>Mako has woken up!</i>

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.590
<i>You're amazing, Mako! We can win this race!</i>

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:00.440
<i>That Evo I Visn't as sharp at the corners.</i>

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.990
<i>He's not as great as I thought he was.</i>

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.950
<i>He's probably not the one who</i>
<i>defeated the Night Kids in Myogi.</i>

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.800
<i>In that case, I hate to keep</i>
<i>showing him our behinds.</i>

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.360
We'll finish him at the next corner, C-121!

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:24.300
I know you know this,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.040
but you're much faster on
the straightaways tonight.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.380
You'll be entering the
corner at a higher speed,

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.040
so don't forget to adjust for that!

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.590
Good, no cars ahead. Go!

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.930
If those girls can clear this corner,

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.530
my Evo IV certainly can!

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.290
<i>I'm going wide!</i>

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.190
<i>I can't stay on the same line!</i>

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.880
It's over, Mako.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.330
Hey, are you okay?

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.730
Yeah.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:29:00.170
Hey, don't tell Kyoichi
anything about this, okay?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.790
Sure.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.680
Sayuki, where's the Lan-Evo Squad?

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.490
You're late, Shingo.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.860
We're already done.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.360
What? It's over?

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.700
I see. Don't be discouraged.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.300
We lost on our home turf, too.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.210
What are you talking about?!

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.970
We won.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.510
I said we won.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.540
They won?!

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.320
Mako was amazing.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.030
She's a genius.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.720
Don't tease.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.230
Let's go home.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.160
See ya, Shingo.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.010
Hey, we came out here to root for you.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.890
That Sileighty is giving off a blinding aura.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.020
They're the real thing!

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.940
You're amazing, Mako.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.250
Maybe last night's Lan-Evo wasn't that good.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.580
That's not true.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.750
He was pretty good.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.590
It would've been a tough race

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.360
had we raced him before
we raced Akina's Eight-Six.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.600
Less-angled cornering has
been our focus since our loss,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.120
and you executed it perfectly.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.040
But at C-121, when we went for the kill,

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:26.280
you went back to your flashy, dramatic drift.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.050
I guess I entered that corner way too fast.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:33.040
I get scared thinking about it now.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.560
It wasn't funny last night.

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.490
I thought I was gonna die.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.330
You sure are an emotional racer.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.420
You suddenly change into someone else.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.900
I feel kind of relieved now.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.650
But I still have a long way to go.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.520
I feel like I'm chasing after something
that's beyond that blue sky.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.020
I don't need a man for a while.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.350
Just watch me, Iketani!

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.690
Bang!

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.200
Have you caught a cold, Iketani?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.970
No, I don't think so.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.800 line:50 %
"Early Autumn: Crispy Autumn"
