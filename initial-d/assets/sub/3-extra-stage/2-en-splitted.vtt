WEBVTT

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.350
You're wobbling a little.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.680
I can't help it.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.190
Yesterday's snow is frozen on the road.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.450
I guess studless tires don't cut it.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.830
What?!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.870
What's up with that car?
It had studless tires, too.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.510
Unbelievable.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.120
Watch out! Watch it! Oh, no!

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Not again! Go right, right!

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.900
Oh, no... Ouch!

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.800
- Sayuki?
- That hurt!

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.310
This snow is frozen solid.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.000
You okay, Sayuki?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.350 line:50 %
"Sentimental White"

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.260
This is so annoying.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.330
We started snowboarding at the same time,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.030
so why are you so good at it already?

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.110
I hate to admit it,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.210
but other girls don't have your athletic talent.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.950
It was the same when you
were learning how to drift.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.040
You have great intuition
and develop so quickly.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.520
It's Shingo!

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.930
Oh, Sayuki?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.260
Long time no see!

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.260
What a coincidence to run into you here!

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.700
I never knew you snowboarded.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.270
Yeah, sure!

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.240
Oh, really?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.710
I know how to snowboard!

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.080
And Shingo always had

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.750
snot dripping from his nose
in elementary school!

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.080
Shut up!

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.790
Everyone teased him by
calling him "Drippy-Nose Shingo,"

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.290
so he turned bad and became a rebel racer!

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.830
Don't make stuff up, Sayuki!

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.420
I just had a cold that day. That's all.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.640
Hey, Mako, don't you wanna
snowboard some more?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.970
- What?
- Go right ahead.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.640
I'll be talking to Shingo
about the good old days.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.630
Hey, why don't you go with her?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.680
Okay.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.290
Thank you.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.010
No problem.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.690
What do you think of him?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.530
He looks wimpy,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.130
but he seems pretty normal
for a friend of yours.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.130
How's his driving?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.670
He's one of the faster
drivers of the Night Kids.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.540
Of course, he's not nearly as fast
as "Impact Blue," Usui's fastest.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.780
Anyway, she's too cute
not to have a boyfriend.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.990
You should've set me up with her instead.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.820
Don't be stupid!
You're not good enough for her.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.160
By the way,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.360
don't let them find out that
this is a blind date, okay?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.030
She would kill me if she knew.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.870
Don't worry.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.200
By the way, what about you, Sayuki?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.640
What?

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640
Nakazato from the other night.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.010
I think he has a crush on you.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.530
You're good. When did
you start snowboarding?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.200
- Last year.
- That's amazing.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.910
Very few girls could go
that fast on this hard snow.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.450
It's exciting and a lot of fun.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.610
When I get into something,
I'm totally focused.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.470
So, Mako, what do you
think of Shingo's friend?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.800
I don't know.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.480
He's pleasant, and seems
like the serious type.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.780
- Is that it?
- What do you mean, is that it?

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.480
I just met him, so I don't really know.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.120
<i>Aha!</i>

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.950
<i>I sense some chemistry between them.</i>

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.290
By the way,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.290
I heard something interesting the other day.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.790
Ryosuke Takahashi of the
Red Suns is recruiting racers,

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.570
including Akina's Eight-Six,
to build a new team.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.160
I hear it'll be a special traveling team.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.770
Is that true, Sayuki?

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.110
I admire them for thinking
of a concept like that.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.310
They never stay in one place.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.680
They always keep moving forward.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.650
They're so awesome that I almost hate them.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.950
They truly have charisma.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.830
I wish I could see Takumi again.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.000
I wonder how he's doing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.640
I bet he looks handsome.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.770
I'm never wrong about things like that.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.040
Yeah, sure, Sayuki.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.650
Oh, man, I'm getting kind of fired up.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.020
Anyway, the road on the way here

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.180
looked kind of nice.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.690
There's no snow down at the bottom.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.060
I was thinking the same thing.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.660
Wanna check it out later?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.630
God, we love racing, don't we?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.860
Yeah.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.570
I'm so bored.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.670
The pass is snowy.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.970
Keisuke...

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.070
Those who conquer winter conquer summer.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.420
Our project won't start until this spring.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.090
But we won't make any progress

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.090
if we just sit around all winter.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.020
Go drive on the snowy road.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.330
What?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Just clear your mind and drive
on the slippery, frozen road,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.390
day in and day out.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.600
You'll see the effect in the spring,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.440
when you change back to high-grip tires.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.110
Your senses will be sharper,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.100
and your driving skills
will be dramatically refined.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.680
Keisuke...

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.350
We'll create a new
unbeatable record at each pass

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.020
and build our legend.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020
Yeah.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.030
The snow is not a handicap.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.900
It's your best training partner.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.400
Racers don't have an off season.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.960
Right.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.610
Studless tires don't grip as much.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.050
But this is good training.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.820
A corner is there, so you attack it.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.250
That's the racer's instinct.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.960
What's up with that car?!

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.660
That was a Sileighty.
Where did it come from?

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.630
Wow, the driver is very skilled!

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.440
How is it?

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.080
These are all one-pattern, mid-speed corners,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.680
so it's boring.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.080
I like Usui Pass the best.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.290
Hello?

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.620
Hey, Shingo, what's up?

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.960
What?

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.770
They've been seeing each other?

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.440
Yeah, he was all excited.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.370
I think they have a date today.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.930
Oh, really? I had no idea.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:05.980
That's good. Christmas is coming up soon.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.710
Yeah. Talk to you later.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.820
<i>I wonder if Mako's many</i>
<i>years without a boyfriend</i>

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.290
<i>are finally coming to an end.</i>

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:25.230
I think this SW20 is a very good car.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.640
A two-seater is fun, but it's inconvenient.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.380
I'm thinking of buying something
more practical next time.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.180
Maybe a 4WD wagon.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.410
Are you quitting racing?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.380
I think so, yeah.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.230
I'm not making any excuses,
but I think I've had enough fun.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.430
When you're a beginner,
you just try your hardest,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.890
and it's exciting to see yourself progress.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.210
But when you get to a certain level,
you kind of see your limits.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:11.110
You stop having goals and become less eager.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:18.590
I guess that's how everyone grows out of it.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:24.060
Well... I really don't think
one's goals disappear that easily.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.560
Oh, yeah?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.700
There was a time when I thought
I would quit racing by this summer.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.570
But I had an opportunity to see

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.370
a much higher-level racer,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.810
and I realized that there's much more to it.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.450
I don't think I could be that stoic,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.940
because I'm not trying to be a pro racer.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:11.730
I'd like you to quit racing,
too, if that's possible.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.510
It's very dangerous to race at a pass.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.750
You're a girl, after all,

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.280
and what if you got into an accident?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.790
I know no one can take away
your right to do what you want.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.160
But if I were your boyfriend...

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.430
...I'd be too worried

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.460
to let you go to a pass every night.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.680
There're so many other fun things to do in life.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.810
It might suit you better to get
dressed up and go out during the day,

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.780
since you're so pretty.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.800
I'm serious about this, Mako.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.460
I've never liked anyone this much.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.470
Please be my girlfriend.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.430
I...

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.700
I'm flattered that you feel that way.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.620
But we just met,

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.050
and this kind of feels too sudden.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.860
I'm not asking for an answer right now.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.030
Let's meet again in a week, on Christmas Eve.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.770
Will you think about it until then?

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.460
Yes.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:45.060 line:50 %
"Christmas Campaign"

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.920
You're in a good mood.
Do you have plans for Christmas?

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.260
No, no plans!

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.090
How about you, Iketani?

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.060
Of course not!

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:45.930
Of course not!

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.760
We're lonely drivers, right, Itsuki?

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.900
- I knew it.
- I don't have plans!

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.800
<i>You guys are just too sad!</i>

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.610
What's with the serious face?

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.810
What's on your mind?

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.490
I don't want to talk about it, even to you.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.190
It's a bad habit of yours

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.490
to keep everything to yourself, you know?

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.130
I have a lot on my mind,

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.430
but mostly I'm wondering what I'm racing for.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.440
I've never had a serious
conversation like this with you.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.280
Do you think my vaguely
wanting to be a better racer

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.970
might seem strange to others?

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.620
It's not strange at all.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.120
Did someone say something to you?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.890
You're just too innocent and easily influenced.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.460
We are who we are,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.630
no matter what others say about us.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.570
Yeah, you're right.

"Welcome to Cherry Park Lane"

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.850
Mako?

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.520
I'm sorry to have you come
out to a place like this

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.890
on Christmas Eve.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.860
No, it's all right.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.890
I need a favor.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.230
Hold on a second!

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.730
I have no intention of racing you.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.400
That's not it.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.530
I want you to sit next to me.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.230
What?

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.780
<i>I usually have Sayuki sitting next to me.</i>

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.720
<i>This feels strange.</i>

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:27.950
Okay, here we go.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.290
<i>She's good... no, amazing!</i>

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.280
<i>I had no idea.</i>

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.310
You're way better than I thought you were.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.050
Very few Night Kids can drive like that.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.950
You may even be better
than Takeshi and Shingo.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.020
I think I understand why
you had me ride with you.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.690
This is your answer, isn't it?

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.370
I'm sorry.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.130
I thought about it long and hard.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.840
You may think I'm a foolish girl,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.400
but I can't shake my desire for racing.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.690
I want to keep chasing after the people

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.590
who are running in front of me.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.660
Even if I can't catch up with them for now,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.920
I want to keep facing the same direction.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.930
I'm so sorry.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.530
I really was very flattered.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.600
I understand.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.610
Goodbye.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.600
<i>I don't know who they are,</i>

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.100
<i>but I'm so jealous</i>

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.860
<i>of the people she cares about right now.</i>

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.780
Hey, where's Takumi?

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.450
Maybe he has a date.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:11.220
Who knows what he's doing?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.650
Let's have fun, just the three of us!

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.490
Yay! Merry Christmas to lonely drivers!

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.720
Hooray, hooray, hooray!
