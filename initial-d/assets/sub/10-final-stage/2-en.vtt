00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.250
Hey, the goal is all on the satnav.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.900
Space out and go on, no problem.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.650
100% safety, 0% risky?

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.850
Don't stress over minor things,
just toss that out the window.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.750
Who decides what's right?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't bother about stuff like that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.650
You just have to stay focused on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.350
All the things you love, and beyond the raging storm.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
(So now it goes above and beyond)

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.650
To infinity!

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.400
Outsoar the Rainbow.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't just stand and watch.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.800
Amp up your senses and fly high.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.650
Let go and fly free even farther.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.150
(Ain't no satisfied, so never stop to fly)

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.550
Infinity.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.150
Infinity.
(You can reach the goal on your own)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200 line:50 %
Initial D

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.050
Crawling desperately several thousand times.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.200
Only they are the ones that deserve to look back and talk.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600
History will prove that someday.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.250
Who could have imagined that Takumi's
very last opponent would be an Eight-Six?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Yeah.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.300
One is the two-door and the other is
the three-door, but both are Truenos.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.000
On top of that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.140
don't you think that the mood is different from
the battle against Akiyama's Levin a while ago?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.290
I feel the same way.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.700
I feel like something unexpected will happen.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.190
Look, I've got goosebumps.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.480
Now I'm getting chills.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.920
Are goosebumps contagious?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.200
Why?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.900
I fell behind a little through a
series of a few tight corners.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.000
Both are Eight-Sixes, so why?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.000
I can't keep up with him in the corners.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.000
I've never had this happen before.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.370
Act 2  [ Strongest Opponent ]

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.990
So, Shinji is really Takumi's opponent.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.460
This is truly amazing.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.450
The quiet types tend
to have an extreme side.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.600
Oh yeah, the same as Takumi.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.000
Both cars are Eight-Sixes,
and the drivers are the same type.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.400
I can't even imagine how the battle will end.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.000
Think of him as your strongest opponent ever.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.700
Keep up with him, even if you
have to use the tires to the fullest.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.780
He's tough.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.260
I understand. I'll do my best.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.600
I'm doing my best

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.550
but I can't catch him.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.800
I'm falling behind.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.820
Did you see that?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:51.600
Yeah.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.000
Fujiwara's Eight-Six seems faster on
the straightaway because he's tailgating.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.700
It's got a special engine, and Ryosuke must have improved the car quite a bit over the past year.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:13.200
On the other hand, the leading Eight-Six's
driving style seems boring, and lacks impact.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.000
Smoothness seems to be the only advantage of that driving style.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:27.480
If he's the type of driver who was chosen by the practical Kubo for this critical situation

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.540
the driver must be the type of
opponent Project D hates most.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.950
There's a meaning behind
the letter "D" in Project D.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.670
I couldn't have even started this
without Keisuke and Fujiwara Takumi.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.200
This battle is not just about winning or losing.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.500
Fight the best you can, Fujiwara.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.700
You've found the most ideal and toughest opponent
who can help you move on to the next level.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.290
Do you want me to explain, Seiji?

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.900
The reason why I said Project D
would hate that Trueno most.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.050
Yeah.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:58.550
When we drive the mountain passes in Lan Evos,
we basically think of WRC drivers as the ideal.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:05.400
You make a relatively large yaw motion at
the entrance of a corner, and turn by drifting.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:15.520
Because of the nature of rally racing,
such a style is reasonable, and safer, too.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:22.530
You mean that steering is only a trigger,
and you turn by using the accelerator.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.530
Isn't that safer?

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:31.250
But having a safety margin means
losing something elsewhere.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:37.110
Closed-circuit drivers don't drive like that.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.050
They'll let the tires grip by using the full
potential of the tires, because you can go faster.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:52.250
But because you can't see what's ahead in a
mountain pass, I believe the rally style is better.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:58.480
Those who are fast on mountain
passes all drive like that.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.000
Fujiwara is no exception.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.700
In fact, he likes to swing his car around.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.550
But Sidewinder's Eight-Six is different.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.000
Wait a sec, Kyoichi!

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.500
Your explanation is getting complicated.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.000
He can't understand it, huh?

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.600
This is just my hypothesis, but

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:31.330
If there was a driver who could drive the mountain pass with lots of blind corners as if it was a closed circuit

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.250
If there was a driver who knows the course
so thoroughly, beyond anyone's imagination

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.100
Fujiwara Takumi's drifting style made
him the fastest in northern Kanto

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.680
but he won't be able to beat the boring
gripping style with his drifting style.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.650
Do you understand?
There's a stylistic issue here.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.500
Is that so? Dammit!

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.650
That said, I didn't understand any of it.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.400
He's not particularly fast
during the entry or the exit.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.250
He's fast during the entire sequence.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.650
Just a little

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:37.900
It's only a little, but I'm
falling behind in the corners.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.650
In most corners of a mountain pass, you can't
see the entire curve from the entrance to the exit.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.600
No matter how experienced they are, drivers
instinctively maintain some sort of safety margin.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.000
This issue is unrelated
to the level of technique.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.300
But Shinji doesn't have that
kind of hesitation at all.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:13.300
I feel like he can see the exit of the corner,
which is invisible to the rest of us.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.000
Why is that?

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.150
He used to

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:29.650
sit in the passenger seat next to me,
and watch the corners from the other side.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.280
That might be why.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.300
He always seemed curious
about the roadside scenery.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.460
Every day for twelve years

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.500
The part you can't see
at night is visible in daylight.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.970
You can pick up many pieces of information when you're free from the steering wheel in the passenger seat.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:14.160
In each corner, there's a slight elevation change from the entrance to the exit, and the change of radius.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:24.000
Also any minor damage in the asphalt, the flow
of rain water, as well as loose gravel can be seen.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.000
The accurate shape of the gutters is hidden
by summer weeds during this season

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:38.170
but he can see them because
they can be seen in the winter.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.590
I see.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.110
He learned the course from the opposite side.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.950
Every corner can be visualized from its exit first.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.180
He learned every corner
from the opposite side?!

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.140
Even if I can catch up with him
in the longer straightaways

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.740
this course has no straightaway, but instead,
it has lots of tight corners near the goal.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.990
I won't be able to keep up with him there.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.200
 What should I do?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.330
No good.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.210
No good.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.570
Not good at all.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.300
It's a strange sight, isn't it?

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.700
The finale of this big event turned out to be an
unexpected battle between two Eight-Sixes.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.450
What's your take, Daiki?

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.700
Fujiwara is better at braking.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.700
He can delay his braking point.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.150
The way he uses heel-and-toe engine braking to slow down his car is at a professional level.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:55.080
On the other hand, the leading Eight-Six
driver's corner entry control is loose

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.360
and he's using heel-and-toe
just for the hell of it.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:06.700
But his brake release point was
so perfect that it gave me chills.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.000
He must know this course very well.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.200
Just like you, the braking artist, Daiki.
Your observation is unique.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.880
Even through my eyes, Fujiwara's racing
technique seems to have improved.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.200
Even so, he didn't seem
to have any margin.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:29.900
No margin?

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.920
That means the pace is fast.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.450
Even if they drive at the same pace,
Fujiwara has a smaller margin

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.000
because he's fighting to the fullest.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.760
On the other hand, his opponent's
driving is gentle and smooth.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.290
That will put less stress
on the tires and the car.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.310
It's amazing that he doesn't
have to swing his rear end.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.750
His style is totally
different from Todo School's.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.380
This won't go well for Project D.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.900
At this rate, it will be
Fujiwara's tires that wear out first.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.490
His braking from a straightaway is fairly loose.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.810
That's almost like how I was last year.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.190
Then why?

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.290
I'm struggling to keep up
after a series of corners.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.000
What's making the difference?

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.820
 The potential of the two Eight-Sixes?

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.100
It can't be.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.200
This car's maintenance is handled by Ryosuke
and Matsumoto, the best team out there.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.650
That means

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.240
I'm the one losing here.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.440
If I fall behind in the next hair-pin curve, things will get even worse.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.880
What, why?

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.700
I don't believe this.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.150
What is he thinking?!

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.480
I want to see them

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.920
There were wings on the back of your car.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.000
I want to see the wings again.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.540
Those breathtakingly cool wings.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.650
I won't be able to see them from out in front.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.250
Show them to me again.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.240
Did you see that, Kobayakawa?

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.360
Yeah, he gave way.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.450
That's one hell of a crazy
move that you never see.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.260
Maybe he doesn't understand
the rules of this battle.

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.150
What the hell?!

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:58.000
He lit the blinkers and fell behind?!

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.070
Are you serious?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.650
I heard it from a record keeper
who happened to be nearby.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.760
I don't know what's going on.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.150
My bad feeling turned out to be true.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.870
He didn't understand
why we chose the lead.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:19.410
Or perhaps, he doesn't know
the rules of this battle at all?

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.930
I'm very sorry.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:28.180
Once the positions are switched, it's the
end unless he overtakes somewhere.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.650
Oh no, he'll lose.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:36.400
If I lose two winnable battles,
I can't stay in this business.

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.250
I love it.
This is so awesome.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:43.650
Hojo

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.650
Sidewinder's Eight-Six driver gave way.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.360
What the hell?!

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.250
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.250
Beats me.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.900
I don't get it.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.030
What the hell is that kid thinking?!

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.450
He told me he wanted to become a hero.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.500
I was moved while I was
watching you drive, Hojo.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.620
I want to be a hero.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.700
I want to race. Let me do it.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:34.420
I like your expression. Go for it.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.580
There's no one else.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.880
Only you can stop
Project D's consecutive victories.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.000
Oh, right.
You don't need to hear stuff like that.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.200
Just express yourself as you like.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.120
Drive freely and have fun.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.900
Tonight's stage is so thrilling.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.830
You're the star, Shinji.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.180
Okay.

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:12.000
He can't be called a hero if he loses,
so he understands the rules.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.500
No doubt. He's willing to win.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.000
In other words, this reckless act is out of
his confidence that he can retake the lead.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:29.000
And against the fastest driver in northern Kanto, no one
has ever dissed that undefeated downhiller so badly.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.550
All hell just broke loose, and
no one knows what'll happen.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.790
Project D must be panicking, too.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.300
Ryosuke and Iwe're all
just spectators from here on.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.300
What's going on?

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.700
This is a battle, right?

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.290
What are you thinking?

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.370
Brother?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.020
What would you do, Keisuke?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.080
I don't know. I'd be panicked.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.900
No one has ever given
way to me during a battle.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.130
It's humiliating

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.870
and one's motivation would hit rock bottom.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.600
It'd take a while to switch your mindset.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.700
Probably so.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.940
This is unexpected.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.240
But it's not too bad.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.690
If this battle had gone as I simulated,
our chances of victory were very slim.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.400
We needed to stir things
up to change the mood.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:06.450
We can't control anything, but this is
suitable for Project D's final battle.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.990
The stars are out there, so there's
no need for a mediocre scenario.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.520
The greatest drama is about to unfold.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.550
Iketani, Kenji, what's going to happen?

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.170
How would I know?

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.000
Right.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.150
All we can do is believe in Takumi.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.300
He's our downhill ace.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.150
Bring it back, hey, rock'n roll!

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.950
Life goes on, I was content with a little bit of hope.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:11.250
Someone decided my future so I only had to wait.
(Just got to get you back and bring it back on)

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:17.450
How small I was, bust it up!
(Here we go, 1, 2)

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.600
Move it up and break it!

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.650
I've gotta run for my dream now.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.550
(Bring back, yo, it's the right time, hey boy, rock'n roll!)

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.900
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble!

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.900
It's a stage on the edge.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.900
(Oh, Yeah)

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.350
Gamble, you gotta dive into a scramble!

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.150
Not even a millimeter of hesitation.
(Check it out, come on!)

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:44.450
Truth is, there aren't many things worth holding on to.
(Give it up yo! Give it up yo!)

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.150
Act a bit tough and gamble away all I've got.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.750
Play the game!

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:54.240
Let's gamble, hey jumbo.
Now shake your bum and do the rumble.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.350
Three sharp lines and maxed out tension.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.500
Here comes the M.O.V.E trio while everyone's asleep.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.720
Even if they call us annoying for all the noise

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.810
I like to move it, move it.
I'll make you move into it.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.450
Let's play the sensual noise of the domestic cars.

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.200
Show a dazzling desire.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.600
Warp all the way from the start to the goal.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.510
Let's overtake at Mach 55, to your next stage.
