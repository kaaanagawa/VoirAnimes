00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.250
Hey, the goal is all on the satnav.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.900
Space out and go on, no problem.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.650
100% safety, 0% risky?

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.850
Don't stress over minor things,
just toss that out the window.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.750
Who decides what's right?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't bother about stuff like that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.650
You just have to stay focused on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.350
All the things you love, and beyond the raging storm.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
(So now it goes above and beyond)

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.650
To infinity!

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.400
Outsoar the Rainbow.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't just stand and watch.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.800
Amp up your senses and fly high.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.650
Let go and fly free even farther.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.150
(Ain't no satisfied, so never stop to fly)

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.550
Infinity.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.150
Infinity.
(You can reach the goal on your own)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200 line:50 %
Initial D

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.050
Crawling desperately several thousand times.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.200
Only they are the ones that deserve to look back and talk.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600
History will prove that someday.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.590
What, why?

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.800
I love it.
This is so awesome.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.040
Hojo

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.550
He told me he wanted to become a hero.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.880
He can't be called a hero if he loses,
so he understands the rules.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.450
No doubt. He's willing to win.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.900
In other words, this reckless act comes from the confidence that he can retake the lead.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.000
And against the fastest driver in northern Kanto

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.090
No one has ever dissed that
undefeated downhiller this badly.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.810
All hell just broke loose, and
no one knows what'll happen.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.900
What's going on?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.000
This is a battle, right?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.540
What're you thinking?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.000
We can't control anything, but this is
suitable for Project D's final battle.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.860
The stars are out there, so there's
no need for a mediocre scenario.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.610
The greatest drama is about to unfold.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.320
Act 3  [ Scent Of Danger ]

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.950
So I just have to maintain my lead

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.770
like this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.700
Shit!

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.830
I can't concentrate at all.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.180
But you know

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.400
this is a matter of winning or losing, so we should take advantage of any chance we're given, right?

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.600
Fujiwara may not like this

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.350
but we can win at this rate.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.200
Fumihiro

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.160
you don't get it, do you?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.530
Letting your opponent pass obviously
means you intend to overtake him.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.700
Overtake?!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.760
That's impossible.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.850
The later section of the course narrows.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.000
How can he overtake him?

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.800
A top class battle is fought very closely.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.550
Fujiwara is our downhill ace.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.800
Whether in northern Kanto or Kanagawa,
he's never lost when it comes to a dead heat.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.200
You may be right

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.900
but this isn't about logic.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.750
I've had some rough times.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.300
But I think something
unexpected will happen.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.020
I share Keisuke's impression.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.800
I don't think Fujiwara can maintain his lead.
It's an unlikely scenario.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.040
Hey, you too, Ryosuke?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.150
You should let go of your
common conceptions, Fumihiro.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:36.040
This is why I said Fujiwara's opponent
was a worthy driver for our final battle.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.840
I never expected to find this kind of talent.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.100
I've gotta keep running away.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.350
The real match will happen in the
technical section just before the goal.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.200
I have to preserve my tires until then.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.790
Compared to a hill-climber,
the Eight-Six is underpowered

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.500
yet both unexpectedly manage to
pick up speed on the straightaway.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.700
It's probably because the cornering speed is fast.
The Eight-Six is so mysterious.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.340
This battle might look
close to ordinary spectators

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.750
because the speeds are high.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.540
Probably so.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.200
But to our eyes,
they haven't gotten serious yet.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.300
It's like the calm before the storm.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.300
You're right.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.230
But there's a strange awkwardness.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.850
I wonder why I feel so
nervous watching this race

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.700
I understand what you mean.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.290
The pursuing Eight-Six
is going to do something.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.360
No, something abnormal
may have begun already.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.750
There's a strong sense of danger in the air.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.050
This battle is going to be rough.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.550
I can't see them.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.950
I can't see the wings today.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.700
Why?

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.300
I'm a little disappointed.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.750
If I can't see them,
it's pointless to stay behind you.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.700
It's hard to drive behind Shinji
because people lose their rhythm.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:03.600
It's probably because of his unusually fast entry into the corners and his own unique rhythm.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.700
It tends to make skilled drivers
lose their rhythm even more.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.050
They make small mistakes
as if they're hypnotized.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.850
Those who've driven behind
him say the same thing.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.060
Some of them almost spun out
while trying too hard to keep up.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:33.400
That's why he should be driving in the lead.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.110
He can only use half of his
strength if he drives behind.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.600
Don't get so riled up, Kubo.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.200
It's clear that he intentionally switched positions.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.420
He must have felt something in Fujiwara Takumi, since he drives the same Eight-Six type.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.500
That's a good sign.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.750
This is the first time Shinji has taken
an interest in someone else's driving.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.190
Normally, he's only
interested in his own driving.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.450
If this is just to win tonight's battle,
he doesn't have to see or learn anything.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.340
But in order for Shinji to break
out of his mold and grow further

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.200
it's probably better for him to
face confusion and struggle.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.510
While his inexperience is his
strength, it's also his weakness.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:38.300
The trigger, which will help Shinji break out of
his mold, is the other genius driver from Gunma.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.260
I'm so confused.
Why did Shinji give up his position?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.520
The local Sidewinder team would normally stick with
the usual theory of choosing the lead position
and trying to pull away.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.500
That'd be a more aggressive strategy.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.000
You take the initiative to
win a battle quickly, but

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.880
I don't understand,
no matter how I look at this.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.850
Besides, how could someone so young

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:08.320
represent Sidewinder, the toughest
team in the Kanagawa prefecture?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.850
I don't know.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.660
But now that you mention it, look at Takumi.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:17.800
Even he was just a high school kid when he raced against us in Usui's mountain pass a year ago.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.610
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.750
It turns out there's more than one miracle
boy with incredible potential out there.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.640
It's not a fantasy anymore.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.350
Here they come!

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.170
Impossible

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.640
He passed

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.600
That Eight-Six sedan is nuts.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.000
This isn't a normal passing zone.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.950
I can't believe this.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:22.250
The super fast Fujiwara Takumi, who has defeated Kanagawa's best drivers one after another

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.220
was overtaken?!

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.730
He was passed.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.750
The Eight-Six from Gunma?!

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.010
T-T-T-Takumi was overtaken?

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.250
That's impossible.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.400
How could that be possible?!

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.250
What now?

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:38.970
Is there another overtaking point left?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.300
This is unreal.
What do you think, Mako?

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.900
I think it's unreal, too. I really do.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:55.200
The entry to this hairpin is twisted like
an S-curve, so there's only one line.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.200
No one would think of going
side by side in a place like this.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.400
But he dove into the corner so casually.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.040
Plus, his opponent is Takumi.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.650
This is just speculation,
but do you want to hear it?

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.200
Sure.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.230
Maybe Shinji just wanted to show
you his overtaking maneuver.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.300
Whatever the line or layout is,
he could have passed anywhere.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.200
That can't be.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.440
He bumped into my car.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.200
It's unexpected, but that's
the kind of driver he is, huh?

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.320
If that's what you want

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.230
It went just as you predicted, Hojo.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.200
It's almost scary.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.420
He passed in the hairpin
at the viewing platform

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.810
disregarding any theory whatsoever.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.280
In a place like that?!

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.560
Yes. When he's focused,
he enters his own world.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.750
Then he can be nasty, which is the
polar opposite of his usual self.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:28.430
He almost has no fear
of damaging his car's body.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.650
That fact alone makes him very unusual

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.850
because street racers hate
to damage their car's body.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.540
He doesn't really care about keeping the
car free from scratches while he's driving.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.200
He learned to drive in a
beat up car with lots of damage.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.380
He doesn't care about brushing the
body against a tree or the guardrail.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.400
Even so, for some reason,
it's always just a minor scuff.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:07.400
He's never caused any
serious damage to the car.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.700
It's like a master of martial arts dodging an opponent's attack by the slightest margin.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:22.400
I had the body damage repaired and painted.
That was part of my strategy.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.400
If I hadn't, our opponent would
have become more cautious.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.850
That was an unexpected passing point.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.850
No one can understand Shinji's natural talent.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.290
But his move seems too early.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.400
I don't think this will end without a hitch.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.270
"Fearless" is the word that fits him best.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:53.900
But, Shinji, Fujiwara Takumi is a far more terrifying
opponent than you can imagine.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.850
The hairpin at the viewing platform?

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.250
You've gotta be kidding.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.450
In a place like that?!

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.710
Unthinkable. He's got guts,
making a move in a place like that.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.430
He keeps humiliating our downhill ace.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.430
Dammit!

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.400
I guess the person who's
actually racing must be shocked.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.850
I hope Fujiwara doesn't lose his motivation.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.700
He won't, not for a trivial matter like this.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.700
He's driving for more than his own sake.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.900
Yes, those rivals he defeated
in northern Kanto are watching.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.300
He's driving with a strong tailwind at his back.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.390
There's no way he'd lose motivation.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.850
The battle begins now!

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.000
It's awkward to stay in the same position.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.270
Think of it as handing
over the position to get even.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.390
Yeah. That's right.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.200
Yeah.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.300
He has a point.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.800
To Fujiwara, this won't be as
dramatic an incident as the others think.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.650
I can see the situation.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.850
He would've been shocked quite a bit if
he was trying to pull away at top speed.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.200
But even at high speed, he should have
been cruising in order to preserve his tires.

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.130
I can't be sure whether he was caught off
guard by the unexpected attack or not, but

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.850
he probably didn't block that reckless move even
though he could, and intentionally gave up the position.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.480
That scenario sounds more plausible.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.000
Not bad.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.300
He tends to break new ground
when he gets into trouble.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.700
Fujiwara Takumi

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.920
he's the type of genius who keeps
evolving, becoming faster and faster.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.400
This is good.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.950
Now that he has the lead position back,
I have nothing to worry about.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:23.110
I don't want to sound like an idiot by
stating the obvious aloud, so I won't, but

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.680
I think this battle will end smoothly.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.850
Fujiwara Takumi is tough.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:35.750
But the more confidence in their speed the driver has,
the more dangerous it is to get behind Shinji.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.450
No one can drive like Shinji.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.910
If you try, you'll end up crashing.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.150
Just like you'd expect from a local driver.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:06.200
We drove Usui every day, so we know
what it's like to feel every bit of the course.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:13.380
It's the type of feeling you can only gain by constantly driving hard, even in the rain or against the wind.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:19.400
He was able to make such a bold pass because he knows this course so well that he could almost drive blindfolded.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.400
He's at a serious disadvantage.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.700
Takumi is racing on this
course for the first time, right?

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.000
What?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.800
He isn't falling behind, but is
managing to keep up with my speed.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.320
He's a little faster than before.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:56.900
Sayuki, do you remember the battle
against Takumi on Usui's mountain pass?

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.600
How can I forget?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.700
Takumi drove Usui for the first time and

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.900
I think it was the essence
of his expeditionary battles.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:16.300
We were the local specialists, but he
stayed right on our tail and synced with us.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:23.200
It was like he instantly figured out and
copied your cornering lines and entry speed.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.160
His concentration was extraordinary.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.700
Maybe he can do the same thing here.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:37.450
No matter how well Shinji knows this course,
or how fast he can drive by ignoring theory

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:42.200
if Takumi can humbly accept that fact

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.110
I think he can awaken the
same senses from that time.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:57.300
I think that's what his essence is, even after growing up to become an undefeated downhiller now.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:04.900
He perfectly copied my maneuver on C-121,
which is the toughest spot on Usui's mountain pass.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.320
I've never forgotten that shock.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:18.920
You're incredible indeed. You're very fast.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.850
But you have the same Eight-Six as I do.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.600
Therefore

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.500
there's no way I can't clear a
corner at the same speed as you.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.600
The next curve is the one that I think
is the toughest on the entire course.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.700
The exit is tighter than the entrance.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.710
Nobody has ever kept up
with me at the same speed.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.100
Wow, what's with him?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.320
No way. That was the first time
someone has pulled that off.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.350
Looks tough, but I can make it.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.100
Wha?

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.890
Why isn't he falling back?

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.430
I'm doing my best, but he isn't falling back.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.200
Oh man.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.560
I just heard a report from the third hairpin.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:42.100
As you know, it's a really
tough spot on this course.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.650
It's not difficult to climb there

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:51.440
but when you go down, it gets more and more dangerous as you try to tackle it harder.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:55.200
The guardrail there is incredibly damaged.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.100
Shinji is in a class by himself when
it comes to that mid-speed hairpin.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.000
When other drivers enter the corner at the same speed, they slide out at the exit

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.200
and crash into the guardrail
as if they were pulled into it.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:22.390
Fujiwara Takumi stayed right behind him
and cleared the corner with no difficulty.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.700
This must have had a huge impact on Shinji.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.320
Based on the section time,
Shinji is going at full speed.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.800
This is a good sign.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.400
Huh?

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.590
A genius instantly surpassed the world Shinji's
built for himself over the past thirteen years.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.700
Fujiwara Takumi is persistent.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.250
Excuse me for saying this

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.200
but you've changed in a good way, Hojo.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.880
You seemed so obsessed with victory
until yesterday, but you're different now.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.940
It looks like you have a broader perspective.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:11.200
Not just victory, but you're also
thinking about developing Shinji's skills.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.400
Maybe so.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.450
I lost my battle.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.600
That must be when I lost my obsession.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.200
It'd be a waste if you end this battle
with only winning or losing in mind.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.090
Everyone who has participated in this event
could be considered part of Project D.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.110
Shinji is fortunate that he
can be on the ultimate stage.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:44.240
I don't know whether he
can win this battle or not.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:51.340
I'm rather surprised that he showed up
at the starting line, instead of running away.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.950
From how he looked this morning,
I thought he'd run away right before the start.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.300
He must be scared, because he's wimpy
and timid when he's not at the wheel.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.100
Once he starts racing,
he can't depend on anyone

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.700
and can't make any excuses.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.690
Drivers are alone.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.700
This guy's fast.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.470
I'm no good after all, Mom.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:33.400
He's desperately fighting his
weakness, but he will grow up.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.460
I don't like this anymore.
I want to quit and drive off.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.100
No, Shinji isn't weak.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.800
He's put in a lot of time.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.600
He has unique senses and technique.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:54.350
Even if he feels weak and loses
confidence for a short period of time

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.030
a driver with that kind of speed can't be weak.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:07.200
In the end, a fighter can only rely on
the backbone he's built for himself.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.110
He has it, which makes him strong.

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.980
I'm scared, Mom.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.100
Bring it back, hey, rock'n roll!

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:04.900
Life goes on, I was content with a little bit of hope.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:11.200
Someone decided my future so I only had to wait.
(Just got to get you back and bring it back on)

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.400
How small I was, bust it up!
(Here we go, 1, 2)

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.550
Move it up and break it!

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.600
I've gotta run for my dream now.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.500
(Bring back, yo, it's the right time, hey boy, rock'n roll!)

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.850
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble!

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.850
It's a stage on the edge.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.850
(Oh, Yeah)

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.300
Gamble, you gotta dive into a scramble!

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.100
Not even a millimeter of hesitation.
(Check it out, come on!)

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.400
Truth is, there aren't many things worth holding on to.
(Give it up yo! Give it up yo!)

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.100
Act a bit tough and gamble away all I've got.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.700
Play the game!

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.190
Let's gamble, hey jumbo.
Now shake your bum and do the rumble.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.300
Three sharp lines and maxed out tension.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.450
Here comes the M.O.V.E trio while everyone's asleep.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.670
Even if they call us annoying for all the noise

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.760
I like to move it, move it.
I'll make you move into it.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.400
Let's play the sensual noise of the domestic cars.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.150
Show a dazzling desire.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.550
Warp all the way from the start to the goal.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.460
Let's overtake at Mach 55, to your next stage.
