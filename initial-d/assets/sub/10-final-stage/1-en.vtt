00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.050
This is fun.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.850
It's not about logic.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.100
You can't just allow your
opponent to pull away.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.500
If I see a car trying to
outrun me, I must chase it.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.550
It's only natural.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.550
It makes my blood boil.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.500
The view is different from usual.
I'm going at an extraordinary pace.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.500
I can't stop. How can
I quit having this much fun?

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.650
He's fast.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.800
Not only is my car under-steering,
but it's over-steering as well?!

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.080
I've never worn the front tires
so much in a hill-climb before.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.340
He must have the same problem.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.410
Dammit!

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.900
I can gain on him a bit if I can
go flat-out for at least 3 seconds.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.400
I have to shed every tenth of a
second I can in order to keep up.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.300
After that curve there's a
4 second flat-out segment.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.830
I must take every opportunity one by one.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.750
Is my entry speed too fast?

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.600
No, I've gotta go for it.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.150
 Swing the tail a bit,
and use four-wheel drift

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.200
I have to keep on pushing, or I'll fall behind.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.650
I have to push it.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.810
Mako, Sayuki, I have to go.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.700
Go? Where?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.100
The best part of the
show is about to begin.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.900
Why don't we watch the
downhill race from here together?

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.100
No, I.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.740
I must go.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.100
Mako, please watch me from here.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.550
I might defeat Fujiwara Takumi.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.750
What is that supposed to mean?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.650
Could Shinji be?

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.300
Just like Takumi,
he's driving an Eight-Six

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.100
and it's a Trueno to boot.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.250
No way.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.550
Takumi's opponent today is

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.380
Shinji?!

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.300
Hey, the goal is all on the satnav.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.950
Space out and go on, no problem.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.700
100% safety, 0% risky?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.900
Don't stress over minor things,
just toss that out the window.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.800
Who decides what's right?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.050
Don't bother about stuff like that.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.700
You just have to stay focused on

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:55.400
All the things you love, and beyond the raging storm.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.700
(So now it goes above and beyond)

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.700
To infinity!

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.450
Outsoar the Rainbow.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.550
Don't just stand and watch.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.850
Amp up your senses and fly high.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.700
Let go and fly free even farther.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.200
(Ain't no satisfied, so never stop to fly)

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.600
Infinity.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.200
Infinity.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.300 line:50 %
Initial D

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.100
Crawling desperately several thousand times.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.250
Only they are the ones that deserve to look back and talk.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.650
History will prove that someday.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:52.450
The race was at such a miraculous high pace it
exceeded the limits Kubo Eiji had set for the car.

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.350
It tells us something about human potential.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.450
The margin of victory between the
winner and the loser is very thin.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.950
The goddess of the mountain pass
cast her smile on Keisuke tonight.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:20.670
Keisuke's honest passion and love for mountain passes must have surpassed Hojo Gou's by a small margin.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.150
Act 1  [ Natural ]

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.180
Brother

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.550
Did you have a chance to
talk to Takahashi Keisuke?

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:01.180
No, but I felt like we had an elaborate communication while we were driving.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.450
There's no need for a conversation.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.950
He must feel the same way.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.000
I lost.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.950
I feel frustrated, but also refreshed.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.480
I saw views I had never seen before.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.050
I see.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.310
If that's the case, you'll grow from here.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.250
You must have done your best.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.490
Good job.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.250
Ouch

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.640
It's all yours.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.950
I'm counting on northern
Kanto's fastest downhiller.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.220
You're just too awesome,
like I always think, Keisuke.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.230
It's in my bones.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.950
I'm glad you came, Shinji.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.440
I was worried.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.950
What changed your mind?

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.940
I was moved while I was
watching you drive, Hojo.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.640
I want to be a hero.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.810
I want to race. Let me do it.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.600
I like your expression. Go for it.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.650
There's no one else.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:32.050
Only you can stop
Project D's consecutive victories.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.180
Oh, right.
You don't need to hear stuff like that.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.150
Just express yourself as you like.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.590
Drive freely and have fun.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.680
Tonight's stage is so thrilling.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.670
You're the star, Shinji.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.100
Okay.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.400
In my opinion, we should
take the lead position regardless.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.240
Shinji has overwhelming speed, but his
opponent has more experience with battles.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.420
Eliminating all uncertain factors is
what a strategic plan is all about.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.150
He can make the best use of
his talent if he drives as the lead.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.850
This match must be
settled on the first run.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.950
I have no objections, Kubo.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.950
Shinji has a good look on his face.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.020
When he's concentrating,
his skills are unmatched.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.200
He's Sidewinder's Eight-Six driver?

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.850
He looks so young.
He's probably younger than Fujiwara.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.150
This is like a joke.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.460
Has Fujiwara ever raced
anyone younger than he is?

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.640
And why an Eight-Six?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.510
Let's completely crush Project D.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:12.970
This is the first street race for our miracle boy,
who grew up on the mountain pass of Kanagawa.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.770
Brother

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.590
Yeah, this final battle could
be his toughest challenge.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.020
I'm Fujiwara Takumi.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.940
I'm Inui Shinji.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.750
Nice to meet you.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.510
Same here.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.220
As expected, they chose to lead.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.080
The first run is the hardest part.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.250
Think of him as your strongest opponent ever.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.650
Keep up with him, even if you
have to use the tires to the fullest.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.950
He's tough.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.100
I understand. I'll do my best.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.830
Let's begin.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.250
Five seconds

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.940
Finally

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:26.000
It's finally time for Project D's downhill ace,
Fujiwara Takumi, to take off!

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.260
Four

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.400
Calm down, Itsuki.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.710
That being said, I'm getting excited.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.150
To be honest, so am I.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.100
Of course we are!

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.200
Takumi represents our home region of Gunma!

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.550
He's more like our pride.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.550
Right, Takumi is our pride.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.530
Please win.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.650
Three

00:11:59.100 --> 00:11:59.960
Two

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.260
One

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.400
Go!

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.950
Hey, those two Eight-Sixes
have different body shapes

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.440
especially the chasing one.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.390
Yeah, the Eight-Six has two kinds,
the Levin and the Trueno

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.350
and each has a two-door
and three-door type.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.200
Project D's Eight-Six, with the rear hatch, is called a three-door hatchback

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.580
and the other is called a two-door sedan.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.150
Oh, I see.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.050
The Eight-Six was very
successful in motor sports

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.450
but the two and three door types
were used in different fields.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:55.850
The three-door was mainly used in circuit
racing because of its aerodynamic advantage.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:01.550
The two-door was the mainstream in rally
and gymkhana because of the stiffer body.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.150
If that's the case

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:10.310
does Sidewinder's two-door have
the advantage in a street race like this?

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.100
Well, in this case

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.650
I guess it does.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.360
What the

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.610
It broke.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.260
I've been using this since I bought my Eight-Six.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.920
Man, this'll bring bad luck.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.850
I'd better toss it.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.120
Wow, he's fast.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.020
I'd better call it a day.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.360
For some reason, I can't concentrate.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.460
On a day like this, it's no use,
no matter how many balls I hit.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.650
Mika

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.400
I'm just not feeling it.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.450
I'll study at home, so can we stop?

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.490
Because today

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.380
Is something bothering you today?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.600
No, it's nothing.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.980
Just let me stop for today.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.940
Takumi, I'm waiting for your text.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:40.980
At one point, I was getting worried,
but at least he reached the starting line.

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.170
He still acts like a child when he shouldn't.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.020
I don't know how to apologize.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.250
You don't have to apologize.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.850
He came to the starting line,
holding his head high.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:00.290
Once he grabs the steering wheel,
Shinji has a different personality.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:02.600
Do you really think so?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.360
I hope that's the case.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.950
I just have a bad feeling.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.850
I feel like he's going to do something stupid.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.900
There's no need to worry.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.150
He may be Sidewinder's youngest member

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.260
but he's a seasoned driver
with the most experience.

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.190
You used to say that, didn't you?

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.950
Um, yes.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.950
I wonder how many years
we've driven this road.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:39.020
It's been twelve years since
he moved up to elementary school.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:45.690
My job is located at a spa resort
on the other side of the mountain.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.950
I drove up and down the mountain pass
every day with Shinji in the passenger seat.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.740
It's only natural that Shinji
knows this road very well.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.150
I see.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:19.880
He has a good memory, but since he
doesn't study his grades aren't good.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.950
But he has a high IQ,
which shocked his teacher.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:33.600
He may have exceptional spatial cognition.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.360
When did he start driving?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:44.500
Well, umm, I can't say this too loud

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.370
but probably sometime during
upper elementary school.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.660
Wow

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.280
That's not even funny.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:58.100
It all started out of his kindness.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.950
I was raising him all by myself,
and I had a lot of worries.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:11.600
He probably couldn't stand watching me drive while I was fighting to stay awake.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:24.870
I remember very well that I was
surprised by his excellent steering work.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:36.810
I drove in the morning because traffic was heavy, so he only drove at night.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.700
I see. That's why he's
unusually fast on the downhill.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.670
Now I know the reason behind Shinji's speed.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.800
He learned mountain pass driving
as if he was playing a game.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:20.150
His steering work is the product
of constant repetitive training.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.210
It's like a refined art.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.210
Why is he so fast?

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.600
I think you have a point when
it comes to him playing a game.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.510
He looked happy every time he drove.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.220
That car is a treasure of my late husband.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:58.080
Because he was a rally driver, I have some knowledge about technique

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.850
I didn't teach him anything.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.450
I didn't even give him any advice.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:12.200
His driving is completely self taught,
without any theoretical background.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.200
He's a natural born talent.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.150
I've been watching him drive
for so long, so I know that

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.950
the center of his technique is no-brake driving.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.120
No braking?

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:33.170
Using the brakes as little as
possible must be his game.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.950
It's nonsense from a
driving technique standpoint

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:42.720
but his goal was never speed.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.450
He doesn't use the accelerator very often.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.600
Because it's the downhill, he can use inertia.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.650
While focusing on steering, he tries to
find the lines that he can drive smoothly.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.620
When he's at the wheel, you can sleep comfortably in the passenger seat.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.760
We're home, Mom.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.300
We're home.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.200
Did you sleep well?

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.500
I want to drive in a way that'll let you
sleep because you always look tired.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.790
Another success today.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.340
He's a kind boy.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.210
Since he caught Mr. Hojo's
attention a year ago

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.580
he's been developing the basics
behind technique and theory

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.490
but his intuitive no-braking
feeling hasn't changed.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.950
He must be an ordinary
driver on other courses.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.950
This road is the only one
he knows so completely.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:01.190
His body knows the limit of how
fast he can enter each corner

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:05.020
literally, each and every single corner.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:14.290
The limit he knows is totally
different from that of other drivers.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.920
If that's the case, you really
don't have to worry so much.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.490
Shinji finishes his job so
smoothly that I almost hate him.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.450
He looks like he wants to tell me he doesn't have to do anything special.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:52.250
Horsepower isn't very important
to fast driving on the downhill.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:58.550
The downslope will help a 100-hp
car accelerate like a 150-hp car.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.680
If you're up against a 200-hp car,
you'd feel like you're fighting a 300-hp car

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.690
but that's completely useless on
the downhill of a mountain pass.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.300
The balance between weight
and agility is more important.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:20.160
Fujiwara won every race on Akina because he had everything necessary to make up for the Eight-Six's lower power.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:24.350
My EG6, your R32

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.950
and the Takahashi brothers, who were considered the
fastest in the Gunma area back then, lost because of that.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.200
But this time, something's different.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:43.200
The trump card Fujiwara had back then seems to be in the hands of his opponent this time around.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:51.590
It's an ironic twist of fate that the last battle of the
final round happens to be a race against an Eight-Six.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.950
I don't know about that.

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:07.230
Sure, the Sidewinder kid has a dangerous aura

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.350
but Fujiwara has gained experience
and developed his skills over the past year.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.450
He's got something beyond logic.

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:21.750
Even when he's pressured, he can find a way to
break through with his miraculously swift reactions.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.950
He has something that can make it happen.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.660
The legend of Fujiwara Takumi will never end.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.950
Why?

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.400
I fell behind a little through a
series of a few tight corners.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.860
Both are Eight-Sixes, so why?

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.630
I can't keep up with him in the corners.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.950
I've never had this happen before.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.100
Bring it back, hey, rock'n roll!

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:04.900
Life goes on, I was content with a little bit of hope.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:12.100
Someone decided my future so I only had to wait.
(Just got to get you back and bring it back on)

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.400
How small I was, bust it up!
(Here we go, 1, 2)

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.550
Move it up and break it!

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.600
I've gotta run for my dream now.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.500
(Bring back, yo, it's the right time, hey boy, rock'n roll!)

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.850
Gamble, you gotta chance to make a Rumble!

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.200
It's a stage on the edge.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.850
(Oh, Yeah)

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.300
Gamble, you gotta dive into a scramble!

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.100
Not even a millimeter of hesitation.
(Check it out, come on!)

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.400
Truth is, there aren't many things worth holding on to.
(Give it up yo! Give it up yo!)

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.100
Act a bit tough and gamble away all I've got.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.700
Play the game!

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:54.190
Let's gamble, hey jumbo.
Now shake your bum and do the rumble.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.300
Three sharp lines and maxed out tension.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.450
Here comes the M.O.V.E trio while everyone's asleep.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.670
Even if they call us annoying for all the noise

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.760
I like to move it, move it.
I'll make you move into it.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.400
Let's play the sensual noise of the domestic cars.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.150
Show a dazzling desire.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.550
Warp all the way from the start to the goal.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.460
Let's overtake at Mach 55, to your next stage.
