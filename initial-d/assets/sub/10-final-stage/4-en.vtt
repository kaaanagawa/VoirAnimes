00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.250
Hey, the goal is all on the satnav.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.900
Space out and go on, no problem.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.650
100% safety, 0% risky?

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.850
Don't stress over minor things,
just toss that out the window.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.750
Who decides what's right?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.000
Don't bother about stuff like that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.650
You just have to stay focused on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.350
All the things you love, and beyond the raging storm.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.650
(So now it goes above and beyond)

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.650
To infinity!

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.400
Outsoar the Rainbow.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't just stand and watch.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.800
Amp up your senses and fly high.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.650
Let go and fly free even farther.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.150
(Ain't no satisfied, so never stop to fly)

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.550
Infinity.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.150
Infinity.
(You can reach the goal on your own)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200 line:50 %
Initial D

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.050
Crawling desperately several thousand times.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.200
Only they are the ones that deserve to look back and talk.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.600
History will prove that someday.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.020
I'm scared, Mom.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.020
Mom, Mr. Hojo complimented me again yesterday.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.990
Everyone tells me I'm awesome

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.440
saying Mr. Hojo's team members
can't follow me from behind.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440
Oh, I see.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.370
Mom, is this something I can brag about?

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.290
This is the first time in my life that
older people have complimented me.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.740
I'm happy for what you can do,
but you have to be modest, Shin.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.090
Don't be overconfident.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.590
There are many drivers out
there who are faster than you.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.190
That may be true

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.090
But more than anything, it was a blast.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.890
It's not like I want to be number one

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.030
but the truth is, no one
could stay behind me.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.220
Mom, I've heard that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.630
there will be a major street race soon

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.690
and Mr. Hojo said he
might ask me to participate.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.040
Street racing?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.210
Yes, but when Mr. Hojo talks
about it, he sounds really scary.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.710
It's like he's a different person from
his usual, kind self, so I don't like it.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.870
So I'm not really interested in doing it.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.540
Mom was right after all.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.190
There must be a lot of fast drivers.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.420
I'm no good at all.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.440
I shouldn't have done this.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.710
I don't like this anymore.
I want to quit and drive off.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.430
Act 4  [ Dream ]

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.250
Could you be

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.010
Yes, you must be.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.260
I hate this, I hate this

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.430
If so, I can do it.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.950
As I thought, your biggest
advantage is your racing line.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.540
If you're the type of driver
who aims to stay on his line

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.790
then you'll be disappointed when you fail to do it.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.890
That's the impression I got
while watching you from behind.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.440
Don't hate me.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.650
It was a little too aggressive,
but at least, I didn't hit your car.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.740
I got passed!

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.280
I got passed on this course!

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.390
There they are.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.440
Those wings

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.870
This feedback from the front

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.190
But from here on, it's a slow section.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.480
When it comes to a technical section,
my car is properly tuned.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.490
Even if I don't use it, I'll pull
away with just my concentration.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.990
There will be no second round.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.030
A disappointing report just came in.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.030
Shinji was overtaken in the second hairpin.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.390
Facing reality, I'll say this again

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.690
No, I have to admit that I've
underestimated Fujiwara Takumi.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.530
He's already exceeded my expectations
by keeping up with Shinji's cornering work

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.090
then he passed him and went ahead.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.990
That's hard to believe.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.290
Shinji must feel the same way.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.190
I'm glad I recruited him for this battle.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.820
Only Fujiwara Takumi can put
this much pressure on Shinji.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.800
He may not have realized this, but he has a strong passion for driving within him.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.950
Once he realizes it, his abundant experience will spontaneously drive him forward.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.590
Mom, I must have become
overconfident without realizing it.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.590
All those compliments made me conceited.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.390
How embarrassing for me

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.390
to let a fast driver like him pass.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.640
I was clueless beyond belief.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.690
Maybe I just got too excited by all the spectators.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.480
It's not like me to want to be a hero.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:24.030
Despite a strong sense of self-consciousness, I'm just an ordinary, timid, wallflower type.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.760
A boring guy who's not popular with girls.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.140
That's who I, Inui Shinji, am.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.190
But my...

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.840
My true self...

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.500
just doesn't want to lose in racing.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.890
I've driven this road more than anyone else.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.390
This is the only thing I'm good at

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.800
so in this battle, I just can't

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:06.690
All the fast drivers we know don't take their foot off the brake pedal, even after finishing deceleration at a corner's entrance.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.590
That's to dive deeper into the corner while
keeping the weight on the front tires.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.440
To be exact, your speed
changes through a corner

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.190
in order to decelerate at the entrance,
and accelerate at the exit.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:29.880
But Inui Shinji doesn't change his speed
from the entrance to the exit while cornering.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:38.230
No deceleration or acceleration means the
whole tire's grip acts in the lateral direction.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.300
Theoretically, it allows him to
achieve the optimum cornering speed.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.690
Wait a minute, Brother.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.290
Does this mean the benefit of his
driving style is not just faster speed, but

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.930
Right, the tires.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.450
Tires?

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.110
I can kind of see it.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.840
When you tackle a corner hard
by delaying the brake timing

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.490
the entire vehicle weight
will be on the outer front tire.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:14.860
On the other hand, if the speed doesn't change in the corners, the tire wear can be evened out.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.470
The downhill is particularly
hard on the front tires.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.970
Even if you drive at the same pace,
if your tire wear is less

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.440
it'll give you a definite advantage
at a critical moment near the goal.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.790
This is bad.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.250
I can feel a dangerous aura behind me.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.610
His tension was down a while
ago, but it's back already.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.440
Damn, I need concentration more now than ever.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.720
If I lose it, I'll be done for.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.040
I've prepared for a technical section.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.840
 If you think you can pass, try it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.630
He cleared the individual corners in the lead.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.740
The tide's on our side.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.040
There's not much left.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.640
I hope this ends without a hitch.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.460
Anyhow, strange things keep
happening one after another.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.320
It's unusual for this type of battle
to have three position changes.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.840
There's no straightaway, and the
road is narrow on this mountain pass.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.280
It's impossible to switch
the lead so many times.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.440
That means such a theory doesn't apply to them.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.840
If you assume it's impossible, you can't do
anything and you don't even try to make a move.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.600
As soon as you wonder whether
you can pass or not, it's too late.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.590
No matter how reckless you have to be,
only a strong motivation of getting ahead

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.210
will successfully make you pass your opponent.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.990
If you think that way,
every corner is a passing point.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.690
Every corner is a passing point?

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.750
At least, that's the kind of battle they're fighting.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.730
I can't explain it.
That's the reality before them.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.750
The front tires

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.040
Not good enough.
He's started to leave some room.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.540
Maybe I can go.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.630
 No, I'll go!

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.610
I'll do it, no matter what!

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:29.930
There was contact!

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.840
If my assumption is correct

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.190
Inui Shinji's cornering can only be achieved by an exceptional level of experience with this course.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.050
Even if you can drive at the same speed, you can't
use your tires the same way he does, not even Fujiwara.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.190
He must really be fighting against the understeering.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.190
Wear on the front tires causes understeering, which can't be controlled by any technique.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:11.190
A slower entry into the corner
is the only way to cope with it.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.190
You must be struggling, but not
all of your chances are lost yet.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.890
Your last trump card is the high revolution zone.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.430
It's a matter of switching your
mindset and adjusting to the situation.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.790
Ordinary drivers can't do it

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.660
but if it's him

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.390
Listen, Fujiwara.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.060
This is an important point, so listen carefully.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:49.930
The modified 20-valve 4AG in your Eight-Six is a
super high-rev unit, capable of more than 10,000 rpm.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:58.890
But when we started Project D, Matsumoto and I
decided to change the engine's output characteristics.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.790
We increased the mid-range torque to give it
more consistent power delivery than before.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.810
It's a result of optimizing both
durability and combat potential, but

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:15.920
unlike before, it doesn't produce a lot of power at the highest range of engine rev.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.790
We've been racing with the rev
limit at 9,000 until now, but

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:25.860
this time, we'd better prepare a strategy for
using the higher range, which we haven't used.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.270
But a higher rev doesn't
make me go faster, right?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.750
It depends on the situation.
Let me explain.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.530
Sounds close.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.770
They must be right over there.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.970
There!

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:00.930
I can't turn.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.660
He got us.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.550
I never thought I'd see such a shocking scene.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.190
But that was a dirty move.
He boldly hit him on the side.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:32.000
That may be true, but it's unusual for
Takumi to be passed so easily on the inside.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.640
Takumi lost speed for some reason.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.490
His cornering speed is the
fastest in the northern Kanto area.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:44.440
His unmatched super high speed drift is

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.890
Gone, you say?

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.850
That means he has no hope.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.990
That can't be true. Don't fool around.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.190
There's no way Takumi can lose.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.440
I can't accept that, no matter what!

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440
I just can't

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.430
It's Takumi!
He will turn this around!

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.370
Crap, I'm really in trouble.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.690
Even if we enter a second round,
I won't be able to defeat him with these tires.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.990
But a higher rev doesn't
make me go faster, right?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.120
It depends on the situation.
Let me explain.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:30.440
It's true that you don't gain much power even if you rev higher than 10,000 rpm.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.240
Instead, a higher rpm means each gear
can rev the engine to a wider range.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.440
In a situation where your opponent tops off his engine power, and wonders when to shift up

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.480
if you keep your foot on the accelerator without hesitation, you can gain 0.3 - 0.4 seconds.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.690
It'll be about the half the length of a car.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:56.970
In a dead heat, there'll always be a situation where you can make use of your advantage on a mountain pass.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.540
I want you to find out where you
can do that during today's practice.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.600
It'll be your last resort,
which will strain the engine

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.750
so you don't want to use
it unless you have to.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.190
I have no other option but to attack.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.800
I'll pass one more time!

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.050
Please hold out, my Eight-Six.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.030
There!

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.110
No way! You're there?!

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.120
His headlights are off! That's ridiculous!

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.990
You're in my way.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.740
I still have some grip left on the rear tires.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.680
I won't lose in the
acceleration at the exit.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.540
The road's so narrow, I feel choked up.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.950
I can't trace my line

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.240
but I don't want to lose!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.210
 I've gotta step on it!

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:37.990
The next is

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.080
the last corner!

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.610
I'm sorry I couldn't give
you better strategic advice.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.330
Don't worry about it.
This was entirely my mistake.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.260
I over-revved too much, but
somehow it went higher than the limit.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.440
When your Eight-Six's engine
blew and you spun 180 degrees

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.590
you cut the clutch to
regain your tire grip, right?

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.390
In the end, the difference in the level of experience mattered in a dogfight.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.770
I wished so hard to win.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:13.750
Maybe my Eight-Six recognized it, and
sacrificed itself to give me one last chance.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.750
Takumi!

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.240
You did it, Takumi.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.660
You're the hero of the Gunma racers.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.890
Well, um

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.350
I'm sorry, I couldn't

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.390
I couldn't become a hero.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:40.990
It's okay.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.190
Seriously, you did great.
No one's blaming you.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.320
I'm glad you're safe.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:54.600
This loss will definitely help Shinji
become much faster and much stronger.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.620
Retire for good?!

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.790
It's sad, but I think it's the ultimate farewell.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:17.690
This car's been Takumi's arms and legs, writing a number of legendary episodes.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.050
It probably deserves to be put
to rest quietly with no losses.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.740
Is that the only way?

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.590
It's really sad, isn't it?

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.620
Say

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.410
Can I keep this car at home?

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.190
I'll fix it little by little with my own money.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.600
But, as Yuichi says, it's reached its limit.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.890
It's not for a battle or anything.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.650
I just want to keep it.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.190
I understand how you feel.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.840
Well, if you insist

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.630
Alright!

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.520
Nice shot, Takumi!

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:09.740
You're far better, like going at full throttle.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:10.650
I'm just

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.490
That's not true.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.490
You're getting better and better.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.190
You can't even compare it to the other day.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:27.970
This is just between us.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:33.740
We've received some inquiries about Keisuke
and Fujiwara from several professional teams.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.940
Really? That's awesome.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:42.840
If they step up,
that'll be so inspiring to us.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.160
Our dream never ends, does it?

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.290
The real Project D goes on from here.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.600
Isn't that right, Ryosuke?

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.170
I hereby declare!

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.620
I'll become a pro.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.490
You'll be successful. No doubt!

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.940
I guarantee it.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.090
You moron.
You're the designated driver.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.570
This is yours.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:10.190
Oh great

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:13.190
The sun is about to set.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.600
I don't know what this sadness is about.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.580
An unforgettable summer is going to end.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.470
Kaori

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:37.960
Ryosuke, your dream

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:45.190
I want to train Gunma drivers who
can compete around the world.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:52.100
I want to keep finding diamonds in
the rough, who can fly out from here

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.890
train them, and send them off.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:59.990
That's my dream. After all,
the D in Project D stands for "dream."

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.290
Ryosuke, I'm glad I met you

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.780
and I'm happy you've made
so many wonderful friends.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.920
Goodbye, Kaori.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.700
I got no impression.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.100
This town is made by the imitation.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.100
Wanting your sensation.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.700
In this silly simulation.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.200
I wanna rage my dream.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.660
I got no impression. I feel gray.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.670
The distortion is too strong.
Imitation all over town.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.700
You seek reality with so much passion.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.640
I can't get close because of your devotion.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:19.700
I feel your frustration in your shout.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:27.210
Taste your vibration.
You shake me up in the sensation.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.180
Rage your dream.
You dash through time.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.490 line:50 %
Ladies Golf Championship

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.940 line:50 %
Twin Ring Motegi

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.150
Even the wind glows bright.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.150
Rage your dream.
Just remember one thing.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.300
Feel the wind.
I'll be waiting.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.250
Rage your dream.
In the never-ending street

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.300
without looking back at your love or your past

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.230
you keep on going, so you shine.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.650
Rage your dream.
You live in the present.

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.120
My pride says "You gotta be wild and tough."

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.120
I don't let others meddle in.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.990
Never stop.
I don't want to stop

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.920
even if I sacrifice my crying lover.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.000
Head for the peak, and sweep the winding street.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Beep, beep! The warning sounds so cheap.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.500
The sheep should make room.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.660
Because I'm never gonna stop streakin' my dream.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.700
Your motivation is easy.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.660
Everything is simulated.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.610
Even if you want to break out,
you'll end up in a safety zone.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.560
You obtain something while you lose something else.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.860
It won't change, even if the world is destroyed.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:39.910
Beasty shout.
No one can handle it.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:47.410
The raging dream goes beyond time now.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.060
Rage your dream to break through the darkness.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.030
Like a streak to the peak.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:59.010
It will eliminate the frozen night.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.400
Rage your dream to explore the road.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.010
Di-ding dang, another round, never slow down.

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.800
Knock down in comma zero one second.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.050
You head for the next town, leaving trails.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.110
Dust rises and the loser falls down to the ground.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.900
The puffery, full of logic

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.720
is bothering, so let's ignore it.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.990
The streaker disappears into the street.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:19.310
Something they would know.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.280
Rage your dream.
You dash through time.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.250
Even the wind glows bright.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:31.250
Rage your dream.
Just remember one thing.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.400
Feel the wind.
I'll be waiting.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.350
Rage your dream.
In the never-ending street

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.400
without looking back at your love or your past

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.330
you keep on going, so you shine.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:51.750
Rage your dream.
You live in the present.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.340
Even today, young drivers keep on racing.
Wrestling to realize their dream.
