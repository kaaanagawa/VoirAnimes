Ah. It's in good shape.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.340
It's gotten to where it feels good to ride.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.500
Huh. And after you'd said how hard it
was to drive after changing the engine...

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.420
It's changed dramatically
since installing the tachometer...

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.330
My car is really fast now.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.020

something like that, just once!

Hey, let me ride shotgun next time
you're at the mountain pass.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.260
Fine, but... It's scary.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.860

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.450
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.170
Thank you very much!

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.620
Huh? What're you looking at, Takumi?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.260
Um, do you mind if I ask you something?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.380
What is it?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.890
How did you get to be so good with machinery?

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.740
How can I put this?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.100
I've fiddled around with cars
and stuff since high school.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.020
Buying one of your own and working on that

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.740
makes it more and more interesting.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.660
Before I knew it, I'd turned
into a bit of a machinery nut.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
Takumi, you've really gotten
interested in machinery, huh?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.620
It's just...

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.100
I finally get it, if only a little.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.820
For example, installing a tachometer
and revving up an engine's RPMs

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.100
can suddenly change a car's whole character.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.860
I never thought machinery could
change the way a car runs like that.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.500
There's a limit to what a driver
can do in terms of handling,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.020
so I'm convinced that if you want to get fast,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.020
you'll have to pick up all
different kinds of knowledge.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.730
Otherwise, it isn't going to happen.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.700
Takumi's seen the light!

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.020
What a tremendous development!!

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.460
That it is. It wasn't long ago, up till summer,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.540
that he didn't even know the term "Eight-Six."

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.740
Even so, since his dramatic
debut on the Akina downhill,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.500
it's been one victory after another, huh?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.060
I remember we all had to work
hard to drag him into racing...

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.000
That's right. But now, even those
have become good memories...

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.610
<i>I... hate racing battles.</i>

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.530
The hairpin is coming!
But he's not slowing down!

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.540

challenges just isn't my thing.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.850

<i>too much when cornering...</i>

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.570

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.300
This is my battle, right? And I...

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.530
I'm going to race it for myself.

<i>monster as our opponent.</i>

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.260
Uh, I don't think that I'm

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.980
a faster driver or anything like that.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.340
Takumi Fujiwara... You were very fast.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.410
See you around.

he races, he gets better, huh?

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.100
Mm. He seems especially motivated recently.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.290
He's really come a long way quickly.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.770
Huh? A white FC?

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.770

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.020
I don't know!

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.180

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.540

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.820
I don't really get it myself, but...

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.890
I get all revved up when
that guy comes nearby.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.660
An expeditionary racing team?!

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.460
That's right.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.420
We assemble a team of the
best of the best in this area

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.380
and head to mountain passes
outside our prefecture

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.980
to challenge the local drivers.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.940
We make new records at each of
the local courses, creating a legend,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.180
and then disband.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.940
Unfortunately, I have been left with little time.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.140
I believe one year from now will be my limit.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.100
No matter what, I want to have
seen the end of this game by then.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.970
To get straight to the point...
I desire your technique!

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.780
Won't you join our team,
and participate as a driver?

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.740
M-Me?!

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.820
You are the man who put
an end to my winning record.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.820
Of course, because this is
my game, should you participate,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.460
I believe I can reward you as is appropriate.

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.220
"Reward"?

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.020
You have made it this far racing
on talent and sense alone.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.860
But soon, you should find
yourself coming up against a wall.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.660
Clearing that wall, heading toward
the area that lies farther beyond,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.100
will require driving supported
by precise theoretical concepts.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.340
In order to get faster,
you will require knowledge.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.220
Have you not begun to notice this yourself?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.460
I can understand...

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.380
...because you are a type of
driver much like my brother.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.340
Like Keisuke?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:19.220
To couple instinctive talent
with theory is to be unstoppable.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.460
I will teach you that which you most require.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.290
And it is best learned while
experiencing racers' local courses.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.700
Do this with us.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.020
You don't have to answer now. Think it over.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.850
O-Okay.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.450
I await a favorable response.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:04.740
You were invited into some new team
Ryosuke Takahashi's making?!

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.020
He says it'll be active for just
one year before disbanding...

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.940
Some kind of special team that'll
be going outside our prefecture.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:16.980
Th-Th-That's awesome!
It's <i>super</i> crazy big news!

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.620
I wanna hurry up and tell lketani!!

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.020
Look, please don't turn this
into some big deal, all right?

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.730
I'm still not close to deciding.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.260
What's there to decide?!

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.380
I mean, my first race was this past summer...

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.900
It hasn't even been six months yet.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.460
It's only recently I've even
become interested in cars...

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.980
I'm nervous whether someone like me
could make it as a team member.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.620
What are you talking about?
Since your first year in middle school,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.980
you've raced the mountain pass
delivering tofu, right?!

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.660
You'll be fine!

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:56.620
Aargh! I'll do odd jobs or anything,
just let me in, too!

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.940
This is awesome! It's too awesome!!

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:03.300
Hey! All you rivals of mine!

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.940
More and more, you'll be left in the dust!

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.500
Anyway, I've been all mixed up
over this since yesterday.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.140
I feel like before I join that team,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.490
there are a couple of things
that I'm going to have to do...

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.460
Incredible! That's what
Ryosuke Takahashi had to say?

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:29.020
Right?! That's some
super-awesome big news, huh?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.940
Yeah! Ryosuke Takahashi represents
the charisma of us street drivers...

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.860
The king of the mountain pass,
winning battle after battle!

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.100
It was Takumi who put a stop to
that record of consecutive wins,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.940
so if the two of them paired up,
it would make a powerful team, but...

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.250
I have mixed feelings about this.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.660
Takumi is the hero of our Akina Speed Stars.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.780
Don't you feel like that's
being taken by the Red Suns?

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.020
I think that Takumi should spend
more and more time out there.

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.300
I want him to grow, really improve himself.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.660
Just think of him being "on loan"
to Ryosuke Takahashi for a year.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.700
An expedition outside our prefecture, eh?

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.180
Long ago, we considered that as well.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.540
He should go.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.650
Takumi isn't the type to be
content with just the Akina pass.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.690
A blown engine means defeat.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.740
Hello?

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.300
This is he.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.220
Um, sorry. This doesn't have to do
with our talk yesterday, but...

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.900
Well, maybe it's not <i>completely</i> unrelated.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.620
There's something I'd like you to tell me...

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.660
The leader of Team Emperor?
You mean Kyoichi Sudou?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:51.260
Yes. Do you know where I could
go to meet this "Sudou" person?

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.060
Kyoichi is an old acquaintance of mine.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.620
I could get hold of him
at any time, if I so wished...

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.580
I...

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:04.340
I thought that if I had the chance,
I'd like to race him again.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.500
I see. And where do you intend to do this?

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.180
I thought I'd go over to his neck of the woods.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.820
Kyoichi's home course is
the Iroha Slope in Nikko.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:19.420
To do it there would be to face a
powerful enemy, and no small feat.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.460
<i>He may not look it, but he quite dislikes losing.</i>

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:39.820
<i>I like his idea of diving</i>
<i>straight into enemy territory...</i>

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.570
<i>It is a quality he will certainly</i>
<i>need in order to become faster.</i>

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.420
Yeah. Takumi?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.140
Nah, he's not here.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.340
He's not?! So he went out in the car?

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.180
Um, where to?

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.050

Huh? What'd you say?

H-Hey, there!

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.370
- Is that?
- The Eight-Six of Akina!

I see. Understood.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.340
Kyoichi, we've gotten word from down below.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.530
A car resembling "the one" will
arrive here at the top shortly!

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.100
Big brother! Are you here?

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.500
Keisuke? What's happened?

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:56.100
We've gotten word...
Akina's Eight-Six is at Iroha Slope!

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.820
Ah. As expected.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.580
Huh? You knew about this?

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.820
I suppose.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.860
Anyway, I wonder if that guy's
after a revenge race.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:10.860
I imagine he is not concerned
with merely winning or losing.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.700
He probably...

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.730
...went to Iroha Slope with
the intent of testing something.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.490
He's here!

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.810
<i>What's this? The Eight-Six</i>
<i>sounds different from before...</i>

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.260
This was some while ago, but...

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.380
...I heard that a certain two-bit
repair shop in Shibukawa

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:50.700
had received a strange sort of
engine via "unofficial" routes.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.740
A strange engine?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.580
While it no longer exists,
long ago a touring car race

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.580
called Group A was in full swing.
Do you remember it?

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.860
No way! It's a Group A engine?!

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.700
In all likelihood, that's exactly what it is.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.260
If it's the TRD engine that was
installed in Group A's AE101s,

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.700
it's not just an NA 1.6-Liter engine,
it's a high-performance unit

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.260
that can go over 1,100 RPMs,
squeezing out 240 horsepower.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.020
It was probably de-tuned for street use

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.420
and placed under the hood
of the Akina Eight-Six.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.220
But even if it is a racing engine,
there's going to be a limit

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.740
to how much power you can
squeeze out of an NA 1.6-Liter unit.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.410
Correct.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.420
You repaired the Eight-Six, eh?

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.580
Yes.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.220
Do you remember what I told you at Akagi?

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.060
"We'll race again when you have a
machine capable of competing with me."

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.700
I believe those were my words.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.820
This isn't the same car it was before.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:58.410
And it's a good car for me.
Will you not race against it?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.100
Fine. For me, this battle
has been left unresolved...

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.140
Here I shall finish it!

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.780
What I'm concentrating on isn't horsepower...

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.570
It's turning!

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.420
Installing that engine will result
in dramatically improved handling.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.060
His cornering, which already
boasted exceptional turns...

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.260
...will now be even more polished!

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:30.690
It may allow for an equal fight
against Kyoichi's misfiring system.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.860
The race will be a single downhill stretch.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.140
We descend to the bottom,
where the road crosses three bridges.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:49.420
The goal is on the other side of the last bridge.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.140
You go first, and I'll follow.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.100
If you can make it all the way to the
goal without letting me pass, you win.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.980
But if I pass you, I win. Sound good?

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.140
But that!

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:08.540
If you want to say it's unfair,
that would be an insult toward me.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.700
Don't forget, the Iroha Slope
is my home course.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:17.460
Without a handicap like that,
this would be no contest.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.540
If there's anything you want to say,
I'll hear it once we're done.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.090
Let's begin!

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.700
<i>The downward route of the Iroha Slope</i>

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.860
<i>is just like a Gymkhana course,</i>
<i>but with steep slopes added.</i>

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.580
<i>No one can get the better of Kyoichi here!</i>

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.340
<i>He has techniques honed in Gymkhana,</i>

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.850
<i>and he's a genius at low-speed cornering!</i>

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.940
<i>I see. He has gotten a little faster, eh?</i>

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.940
<i>An increase in acceleration</i>
<i>particular to mechanical tuning</i>

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.260
<i>and different from that of a turbo.</i>

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.540
<i>However, no matter what</i>
<i>tuning was performed...</i>

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.860
<i>...it's still an Eight-Six.</i>

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.050
<i>I have 350 horsepower!</i>

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.730 line:50 %
"Curve"

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.500
<i>That is a super high-rotation engine...</i>

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.220
<i>Wiseass! Does he think a modification like that</i>

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.840
<i>can compete with my misfiring system?!</i>

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.820
<i>No matter what car challenges me,</i>
<i>I cannot lose here!</i>

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:35.300
<i>As with Ryosuke in Akagi,</i>
<i>here I am the emperor!</i>

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.410
<i>I won't let my prey escape!</i>

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.860
<i>He's staying right on me...</i>

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.650
<i>Anyway, all I can do is go all-out!</i>

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.980
<i>This slope will soon level out...</i>

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.220
<i>The Eight-Six will slow down there, too.</i>

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.170

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:24.380

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:28.340

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.650

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.340
<i>Save for one exception...</i>

<i>A bridge?!</i>

<i>Is the goal coming up soon?</i>

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.260
<i>The first bridge! This is the end</i>
<i>of the steep-gradient section.</i>

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.620
<i>From here, this will require all-out power.</i>

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:10.370
<i>I will show you...</i>
<i>the Kyoichi Sudou-style winning equation!</i>

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.420
The second bridge...

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.620
<i>And a high-speed right corner,</i>
<i>as if one had been</i>

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.540
<i>shot from the top of the</i>
<i>bridge from a catapult.</i>

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.660
<i>For senses accustomed to</i>
<i>the slow-velocity section,</i>

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.420
<i>it's frightening enough</i>
<i>to make your heart leap out!</i>

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.900
<i>An optical illusion, the road seems to close in,</i>

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.740
<i>leaving no room on the outside.</i>

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.250
This race is mine!

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.620
<i>The third bridge.</i>

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.820
On that bridge, the outside
becomes the inside.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.780
For me it's the same finish as always!

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.410
The moment I pulled
alongside him, it was all over!

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.860
<i>I see it! Do I go?</i>

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.450
<i>Go!</i>

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.700
What?! Idiot! Does he want to die?!

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.980
He's going too fast! He can't turn!

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.090
Turn! Come on, turn! My Eight-Six!

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.930
Can he make it?!

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.700
In today's race,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.980
the quick left turn going into
the third bridge was everything.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.700
A normal Eight-Six couldn't
make that turn there...

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.660
Or rather, a person with normal
nerves wouldn't plow in like that.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.700
Were you sure of what you were doing?

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.980
I... I start to "see" the road.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.220
Earlier, too, I could clearly see the line

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.700
that my car's outer tires would be following.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.340
I thought I could just barely make it,
so I eased up on the brakes

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.700
and went as-is.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.140
I can't really explain it,
but I've always been this way.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.340
Once I've "seen" a road, I can just drive it.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.980
I see...

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.540
It's a strange car, that one.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.820
It's not a car that just anyone
can drive, I'll give you that.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.140
It's a good car.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.820
It is?

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.440
I lost. Let's meet again if we have the chance.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.860
I'm really happy, but... I don't feel like I won.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.970
Maybe it was a draw, if you look at it fairly...

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.890
Hey, Takumi! Get up!

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.000
You were out pretty late
last night. Where'd you go?

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.860
Iroha Slope.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:00.140
Say, Pops, going forward,
there's probably going to be more of this.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.260
Getting back just in time and
going straight out to deliver...

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.420
I think there are going to be times like that.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.460
If ya make it back in time to deliver,
I've got no complaints.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.530
More to the point... Here.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.700
I don't want ya dozin' off
and wreckin' the tofu.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.780
Drive careful so you don't spill the water.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.300
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.860
All right, I'm off.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.210
Keisuke...

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.820
I heard. You went up against
an Evo III at Iroha Slope.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:00.140
You already know about that?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.300
Those sorts of stories get spread around fast.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.260
It'll be winter soon.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.620
Our expeditionary plan will start in earnest

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:15.180
in spring of next year, once the
icy road season has finished.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.100
You're coming, right? With our new team?

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.140
My big brother's time limit is one more year.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.820
So I want to give everything
I've got during that year

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.780
and race for my big brother's dream.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.700
In this grand game he's so passionate about...

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.620
...what sort of catharsis will be at the ending?

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:40.140
I want to know that! If you let
my big brother teach you,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.860
after one year, I'm sure you'll be crazy good.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.660
But I'm gonna get to a level
far above even that.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.060
Our race will wait until then...

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:57.300
But in one year's time,
I'll beat you and attempt to go pro!

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.010
I'm going to be a big, major-league name.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.420
Come with us.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.450
Let's do this, together.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.780
<i>Incredible...</i>

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.690
<i>What incredible people!</i>

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.780
What? Is that for real?

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.060
It's for real! He totally took on
Sudou of Team Emperor

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.620
for a downhill battle on Iroha Slope!

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.940
And what was the outcome?

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.740
Takumi says it was a draw.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.180
A draw?

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.380
Yes. But friggin' Takumi,
he looked content with that.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.140
I don't doubt it. Sudou's speed is renowned...

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.060
...and what's more, this was
on the enemy's home course.

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.220
That being said, the Eight-Six's new engine

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.700
may be an absolute devil of a thing.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.380
Takumi may well have awesome technique,

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.900
but having enough power to
go up against a Lancer Evo...

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.980
I think that makes this a serious matter.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.140
A serious matter?

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:16.380
Yes. For the first time,
Takumi has acquired a machine

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.340
at which he can throw
everything he's capable of.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:23.140
Perhaps the true legend of
Akina's unbeatable Eight-Six...

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.730
...is only about to begin.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.130
Welcome!

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.300
High octane. Uh... 20.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.740
Putting in 20 liters of high octane!

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.940
Hey, hang on a minute.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.410
Make that 15.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.180
Are you the Eight-Six of Akina?

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.100
No, I'm not. And you are?

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.380
I came 'cuz I heard you can
meet Akina's Eight-Six here.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:00.610
I'm Kogashiwa.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.370
<i>Kogashiwa, he said? It can't be!</i>

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.610 line:50 %
"Tochigi"

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.420
Here it comes!

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.420
Hyaa!

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.530
Aww, jeez!

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.010
- Hyaa!
- Okay!

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.380
Don't go there, it's dangerous!

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.940
Order in! Fast Burger, small fries,
and iced tea, no sugar...

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.260
One of each!

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:39.050
Okay!

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.660
He's not here yet, but he should be by 5:00.

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.220
He said he had somewhere to go...

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.380
Okay. I'll come by again.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.700
Sir!

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.260
You said "Kogashiwa" just now, didn't you?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.340
I apologize if I'm mistaken, but...

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.580
Could that be as in Ken Kogashiwa?

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.620
Ken Kogashiwa... is my father.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.460
Thank you very much!

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.410 line:50 %
"Gas"

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:10.820
Thank you very much!

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:15.020
Come on manager, please tell me
about that customer just now!

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.260
What was that about?

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.060
You mean about Ken Kogashiwa?

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.940
Yeah! Just who is he?

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.860
It'd been a long time since
I'd thought of that name.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:30.740
How many years, I wonder...
Twenty years? No, easily more than that.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.780
Back then, Bunta and I were
running various mountain passes...

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.180
...and Ken Kogashiwa was a
rally racer working the Iroha Slope.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.660
At the time, he was Bunta's greatest rival.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.020
Anyway, he had a crazy racing style.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.220
He went up against Bunta several times,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.180
and in the last big race, Bunta won.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.460
We didn't hear a single
thing from him after that.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:59.100
<i>Bunta Fujiwara, legendary</i>
<i>racer and Takumi's father.</i>

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.380
<i>And this is his rival...</i>

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:07.450
His son grew up so fast, and
now he's come to meet Takumi...

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.220
<i>That was some pretty good driving.</i>

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:37.540
What was that just now?! What happened?

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.980
I felt a jolt just by going past him!

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.220
I still don't get it... But it was awesome!

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.420
A challenge to a race?

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.620
That's the sort of feel it had to it.

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.700
Yeah! And I think it was an SW20
with a Tochigi license plate.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:57.420
That car's a mid-engine, so it
has formidable racing power.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.260
"Mid-engine"?

00:36:59.260 --> 00:36:59.420
"Mid-engine"?

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.540
It means the engine is
located behind the driver.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:06.740
In normal cars it's in front of the driver's seat,

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:06.680 line:50 %
"Now accepting card applications!"

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:06.860
In normal cars it's in front of the driver's seat,

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.860
but in a mid-engine, it's opposite.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.300
In a rear-axle drive,
having the engine to the rear

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.620
makes the tires less likely to slide
when your foot's on the gas.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.780
That gives it the acceleration
advantage when coming out of corners.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.780
Having that heavy engine
centrally located in the car frame

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.620
has the benefit of increased maneuverability.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:27.890
F-1 machines are all mid-engines, too.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.690
H-He's here!

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:38.780
Yes, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:38.730 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:38.940
Yes, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:44.380
Kogashiwa? Ken Kogashiwa?
This is unexpected!

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.850
How many years has it been
since I've heard your voice?

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.980
So you're the Akina Eight-Six?

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.380
It seems you beat Sudou of
Team Emperor at Iroha Slope.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.820
Sudou was <i>my</i> target!

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.820
The locals said that loud,
sputtering Evo III was unbeatable...

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.460
But I was confident I would defeat it!

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.180
I was so close, and you swooped
in and stole all my thunder!

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:14.500
That's why my target has shifted
automatically over to you.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.300
I want to challenge you!

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.650
Well? What's your answer?

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.500
I don't feel I beat the Evo III,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.730
but after a story like that,
I don't intend to run away!

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.540
I can't say when, but before snow falls,

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.820
I will definitely go to Iroha Slope again!

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.660
Fine, understood. I look
forward to it with pleasure.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:45.700
My name is Kai Kogashiwa. And you are?

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.180
Takumi Fujiwara. Sorry,
but I'm working right now, so...

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.020
Ah, my apologies. Oh, and one more thing.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.540
Were you out racing on Akina earlier?

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:57.780
No...

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.130
I see. Then, no matter.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.130
Huh?

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.090
What're you doing, Pops?

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.860
Takumi...

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.100
Someone came to meet you today, didn't he?

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:41.060
Driving a squat-looking car called an SW20...

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.360
How did you know that?

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.180
Do you plan to race him?

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.860
Yeah.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:54.180
I hate running away from a challenge.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.010
You... would lose.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.220
Dad, I went to where
Akina's Eight-Six is yesterday.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:19.460
Is that so? You're finally going
to challenge Fujiwara's son?

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.420
You know about that, Dad?

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.820
Yeah, there's a bit of a backstory there...

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:30.570
Kai, there is a good strategy
for beating the Eight-Six!

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.210
- See ya!
- Okay, see you tomorrow.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.210
<i>Takumi!</i>

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.020
Come on Takumi, don't ignore me.

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.300
I want to talk to you about
something. Meet me later.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.820
Why tell me?

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.180
We're friends, aren't we?

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.700
"Friends"?

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.660
Takumi, you told me before that
it's not as if we're dating, right?

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:04.340
S-So that makes us friends, right?

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.140
And if we're friends, then you can
help me with some advice, right?

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:12.580
Takumi, wait! Meet with me, please!

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.610
I... I'm busy.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.500
Takumi!

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.060
Hey, when are you thinking
about going to Iroha Slope?

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.020
Once you decide to do something,
sooner is better, right?

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:40.340
It's not as if delaying it will change anything...

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.660
That's why I'm going tonight.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.900
You're joking, right? Are you serious?!

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.980
I mean it.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.580
Tomorrow's Saturday, so it's
only a half day at school...

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.580
I'll probably be all right even if
I don't sleep too much tonight.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.740
When you make up your mind,
you don't mess around, do you?

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.860
Anyway, what are you gonna do?
About the new team.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.140
Yeah...

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.500
You're joining, right?
Have you already told them?

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.900
Not yet.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.740
Not yet?!

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:12.980
It looks like the team's not going
to really get moving till spring.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.980
I've got a bit of time till then.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.740
There's a lot for me to think about.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.180
Think about?

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:24.380
My heart's in it, but it's just so intimidating.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.380
Ryosuke and Keisuke are incredible people.

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:33.260
They have such firm senses of purpose...

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.860
Me, I just sort of want to go fast, that's it.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.370
A sense of purpose, huh?

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.580
You going?

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.900
Yeah.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.220
Aah. It's pretty tough over there.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.260
I'll give you one piece of advice.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.700
Huh? This is unexpected!

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.370
Just shut up and listen.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.060
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.060
You can trap him at the area
of the last bridge. By then...

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.660
...he's sure to be in front of you.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.650
You can't know that, can you?!

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.250
Good!

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.580
Listen here, Kai.
You're up against Fujiwara's son.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.340
He's bound to be incredibly skilled.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.100
Winning this race will require
both strategy and technique.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.340
I will tell you the strategy
for beating Fujiwara's son.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.140
First, let him get ahead of you.

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.500
Are you nuts?! That idiot
"strategy" can go screw itself!

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.780
If you let someone who may
be faster go in front of you,

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:01.620
then of course you're gonna lose!

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.700
Think clearly, and you'll see that
overtaking him is just impossible!

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:09.780
To be sure, a standard
approach would be of no use...

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.060
That is exactly what makes this a strategy!

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.260
At the Iroha Slope, sometimes a line appears

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.700
that is even farther in than the corner line.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.780
You're telling me I should follow it?!

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.940
You're okay with that, Dad? Whatever
happens to the car ain't my fault!

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.340
Just do it. Then, overtaking him
will be, to use a boxing metaphor,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.220
a win by knockout!

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:36.820
This time, make sure anyone who
sees will know it's a clear win!

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.540
Listen Kai, set him up after the midway point.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.690
Till then, whatever else, just keep up with him.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.530 line:50 %
"Tochigi Prefecture"

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.140
Under his dad's gifted tutelage,
he started doing karts as a kid,

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.860
winning who knows how many races.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.380
What's a legit racer like
that doing on the streets?

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.900
Who knows? Before that,
he'd apparently been the fastest

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.220
to do the Iroha Slope on a motorcycle.

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:12.500
Oh, that's right. There's an
Emperor named Seiji lwaki, right?

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.700
He rode a white Evo IV...

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.860
Oh, that bastard who had his
hair done up in back, right?

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.660
When Team Emperor invaded the Gunma area,

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:24.300
he beat everyone single-handed, right?

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.180
It seems that same lwaki was
recently rather soundly beaten

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.850
by that SW.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.580
You again?!

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:47.900
I have no intention of going up
against you all tonight, lwaki.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.220
I just thought I'd give you a brief heads-up.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:52.860
A heads-up?

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.540
Tonight, I'll be racing the
Eight-Six of Akina here.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.540
What?!

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.100
It won't do for you to
keep losing to outsiders...

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.500
So I'll put a stop to him, Sudou.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.940
- Bastard!
- It's an interesting match, don't you think?

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.780
Akina's Eight-Six vs. Kogashiwa,
graduate of kart racing.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.210
What shall be the result?
I'm quite eager to know.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.020
Thanks for coming. Do you not
need to take a look at the course?

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:30.580
I already have. I got here early, so I did a lap.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.500
Then I will explain the rules.
We start at the same time.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.340
When you've completely crossed the
third bridge, you've crossed the goal line.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.700
Whoever gets there first wins.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.820
You good with that?

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.770
Then let's begin.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.580
<i>There's no mistake...</i>

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:54.020
<i>This Eight-Six is the Panda Trueno</i>
<i>I passed in Akina before.</i>

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.980
<i>Meaning that the person</i>
<i>behind the wheel then...</i>

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:04.500
<i>...was the guy who beat my dad,</i>
<i>Bunta Fujiwara. And this is his son.</i>

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.300
<i>I didn't really "get" it when I
met him at the gas station...</i>

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.290
<i>...but now I feel it.</i>

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.220
<i>This guy is fast!</i>

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.170
<i>What a thrill this has become... I have to do it!</i>

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.020
Okay. Understood.

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.700
It looks like it'll start soon.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.450
Understood.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.090
Ryosuke...

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:43.010
I heard there's an interesting
race to be seen here, so I came.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.020
Do as you like.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:50.370
The wind is strong tonight...

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:57.260
It may be dangerous.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:02.420
Great piles of dried leaves
are sure to be on the streets.

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:07.020
At the critical moment,
what decides this competition...

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.100
...may, of all things, be these leaves.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.050
The whimsy of a fallen leaf, eh?

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.220
Takumi! What do you think?

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.900
Please don't get your hopes up too high.

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.260
You don't have a plan?
Didn't your father say anything?

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:36.700
Yeah, he did, but... It was just nonsense.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.260
Hey, give me a break!

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.300
The only thing to do is go all-out!

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.610
Do your best, Takumi!
You can whup him, I'm sure of it!

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.090
Okay, here goes!

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.380
Five... Four... Three...

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.300
Two... One...

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.890
Go!

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.180
Whoa, awesome! The Eight-Six really took off!

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:08.660
Takumi's so fast!

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:12.460
<i>Incredible! The mid-engine should have</i>
<i>the advantage at the starting dash...</i>

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.130
<i>The Eight-Six's new engine</i>
<i>is incredible after all!</i>

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.660
<i>He's so fast! This is no ordinary Eight-Six.</i>

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.780
<i>It has more power than a 2-liter 3S!</i>

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.020
<i>My dad said that letting him go ahead</i>

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.380
<i>and then overtaking him</i>
<i>would be a knockout victory.</i>

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:40.980
<i>Good! That's fine by me, too.</i>

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.620
<i>I'll overtake that "fast" Eight-Six</i>
<i>from behind and show them all!</i>

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.460
<i>I'll overtake that "fast" Eight-Six</i>
<i>from behind and show them all!</i>

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:44.370 line:50 %
"Reduce Speed"

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:44.930
<i>I'll overtake that "fast" Eight-Six</i>
<i>from behind and show them all!</i>

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.620
Okay, understood.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:57.340
The Eight-Six has been in front since the start.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.860
That Kogashiwa dude is nothing but talk, huh?

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.780
Even <i>you</i> couldn't capture the Eight-Six.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.860
If he let it go first,
his non-turbo SW has no chance!

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:09.570
I don't know about that.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:16.340
I had absolute faith in my counter
strategy just before the goal...

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.980
In that respect, I can't say
that I didn't let my guard down.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:20.700
So?

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.140
I avoided unseemly tactics,

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.220
and tried to run a clean
race with no funny business.

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.660
That pride is what dug my grave.

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:33.540
If Kogashiwa runs an all-out dirty race,
he has a chance at victory.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.140
What are you talking about?

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.580
Put simply, a line. There is a special line

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.060
for overtaking a car that's ahead of you,

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.010
right here on the Iroha Slope!

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.900
Kogashiwa used to race karts,
so he'll use a left-footed brake.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.100
With his right foot still on the gas,
putting his left on the brake

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.700
will shift load to the front,
eliminating understeer.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.240
This way, he can go forward at full throttle!

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.580
On a unique pass like this,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:20.220
there's bound to be things only
a local would know about, huh?

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:24.100
I think Kogashiwa has been
considering various strategies...

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.780
Takumi has the disadvantage.

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:30.300
But long ago, Takumi's dad raced
Kogashiwa's here and won, right?

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:36.300
Yeah. I thought he'd give some
advice based on the experience...

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.540
...but Takumi just showed up half-cocked.

00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.290
That Takumi... He's in trouble.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.060
<i>There are a lot of leaves out tonight...</i>

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.820
<i>What's more, the wind</i>
<i>has blown them into piles.</i>

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:56.780
<i>Going over one of those</i>
<i>would send you flying...</i>

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.460
<i>This will be difficult.</i>

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.500
<i>Still, these conditions should be</i>
<i>harder for the Eight-Six up ahead.</i>

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:05.290
<i>He doesn't know where</i>
<i>or when he's going to slide.</i>

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.420
<i>This is hard to race!</i>

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:15.500
<i>Instead of just sliding,</i>
<i>maybe I should make it slide.</i>

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:20.820
<i>I should hurry and spin the rear</i>
<i>tires out, and drift all four of them!</i>

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:22.620
What's he doing?!

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.220
<i>He plowed right into the pile!</i>

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:27.250
<i>Drifting on a road surface</i>
<i>made easy to slide on, eh?</i>

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.460
<i>You're something else, Takumi Fujiwara.</i>

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.180
<i>Half-assed tricks won't work on you.</i>

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.820
During the hairpins at the Iroha Slope,
sometimes a line appears

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:41.220
that is even farther in than the corner line.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.050
<i>Where should I spring that trap?</i>
<i>Timing will be critical!</i>

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.540
Yes, this is the 33rd corner.
The sound of their exhaust

00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:48.780
is getting very loud!
They will be at this hairpin soon!

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.740
is getting very loud!
They will be at this hairpin soon!

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.690 line:50 %
"Curve"

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.180
Is getting very loud!
They will be at this hairpin soon!

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:55.380
Okay. Give me the blow-by-blow
once they're there.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.130
- It will soon begin.
- Huh?

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.140
<i>I have a bad feeling. I don't really know what,</i>

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.130
<i>but some trap is about to spring!</i>

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.680
<i>I can't wait anymore! Dad, I can go now, right?!</i>

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.740
<i>This sensation, it's all tingly...</i>

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.490
Something is coming!

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:26.850
The trap will be at the 33rd corner ahead!

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.970
They're here!

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.900
They're here, sir! The Eight-Six is in the lead!

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.970
Here!

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:42.580
What is it? What's happened?

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.940
What? The SW went even
farther in than the in line?

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:48.780
What was that?! It overtook the Eight-Six?

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:50.260
The Eight-Six was overtaken?

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.700
A special local move, eh?

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:55.180
Well played, Kogashiwa.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:54:00.100
What, the SW pulled ahead of
the Eight-Six? At the 33rd corner?!

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.260
Hey, this has turned into one incredible race!

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.780
How did he pull it off at a hairpin like that?

00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:07.620
- Did you hear?
- This will be a tight race.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:09.890
Takumi!

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:45.300
<i>Don't think badly of me.</i>

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.020
<i>The line farther in than the</i>
<i>corner line is drawn in mid-air!</i>

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:52.580
<i>It's a hairpin curve particular to Iroha Slope,</i>
<i>which has great height differential.</i>

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.820
<i>That's what makes it possible!</i>

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.120
<i>This is a local race that breaks all the rules!</i>

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.810
This race is mine!

00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:08.730
<i>I'll lose! At this rate, I'm going to lose!</i>

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.380
What do you think, big brother?

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:21.260
There are 11 hairpins remaining.
The outcome is not yet certain.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:23.900
What do you mean, Ryosuke?

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:27.300
Kyoichi, this has unfolded
just as you said it would.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.180
However, don't you think
the trap came too soon?

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:34.060
A trap sprung too early
gives the opponent a chance

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.860
to recover from the
psychological damage inflicted.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.690
I see them! They're now at the 37th corner!

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.330
<i>At this rate, he'll just get</i>
<i>farther and farther ahead!</i>

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.980
<i>Shoot! This guy just won't quit.</i>

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.250
<i>Fine. Guess I'll do another corner!</i>

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.500
He took off!

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.370
Go!!

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.340
<i>Unbelievable! He cleared the jump in one go!</i>

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.700
<i>It's like he's got his finger</i>
<i>on the pulse of the road!</i>

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.420
<i>But once I've been let out in front,</i>
<i>you've got no chance!</i>

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.010
<i>I'm gonna race like this right toward the goal!</i>

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.900 line:50 %
"Hokkai Ramen"

00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:45.540
A racing line against
which there's no defense?!

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:45.780
One draft beer, please.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.730 line:50 %
"Takahashi"

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.300
One draft beer, please.

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.380
Yeah.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:51.620
Why didn't you tell Takumi about that?

00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:56.020
Coming down Iroha Slope, there's a
bridge and a tunnel at the end, right?

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.460
- Yeah...
- I told Takumi,

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:03.100
"If you challenge him, that last spot will
be the only place to get the drop on him."

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.580
And I said when he gets there,
he's sure to be behind.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:10.460
His face told me he wasn't gettin' it...

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.140
I wonder if he understands by now.

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.540
You gave him some advice
on how to pull ahead?

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.500
In a sense.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:23.340
If he can understand what I told him...

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:27.060
...he's got about a 50%
chance of getting ahead.

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.260
What the heck, just 50%?!

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.260
That's low!

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.570
Of course it is. His opponent
will be racing at full speed.

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:47.290
<i>Bunta, this time it will be</i>
<i>your turn to taste defeat!</i>

00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:04.180
<i>He's really good! Being overtaken</i>
<i>and looking at him from behind...</i>

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.020
<i>...I can see that clearly.</i>

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.540
<i>We're about the same speed</i>
<i>on the straight-aways,</i>

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:10.570
<i>but his corners are incredibly fast!</i>

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.060
<i>It's taking everything just to keep up...</i>
<i>Fat chance of overtaking him!</i>

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.770
<i>At this rate, I'm gonna lose,</i>
<i>just like my dad said.</i>

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:25.090
<i>Come to think of it, what was it my dad said?</i>

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:31.500
You can trap him at the area of the last bridge.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.740
By then, he's sure to be in front of you.

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.700
You can't know that, can you?!

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.340
Yes, I can know that.

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:43.290
All right, this is the important part,
so shut up and listen.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.700
At this time of year, the brush
along the roads of Iroha Slope

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.690
starts to dry out. That's your chance.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:51.640 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:51.900
Starts to dry out. That's your chance.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.980
If ya start creepin' up
on him at the first bridge,

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:59.380
the entrance at the second one
will be tight but barely doable.

00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:02.580
With your skills, you'll be
able to stay alongside him.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:06.700
If ya go divin' into the third one together...

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.900
Then it's all up to luck.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:11.280
Give it your best.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.620
<i>So Dad knew that Kogashiwa</i>
<i>would pull those jumps?</i>

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:26.220
<i>But what really matters is what</i>
<i>comes next, and I don't get it!</i>

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.940
<i>The time when the brush starts to dry out...?</i>

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.730
<i>What's he telling me to do?!</i>

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:38.620
<i>One more left! Coming up</i>
<i>is the last hairpin curve!</i>

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.740
<i>Once we get into the mid-to</i>
<i>high-speed section past that,</i>

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.370
<i>he won't have a prayer!</i>

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:53.250
<i>I'm feelin' good, Dad!</i>
<i>Everything is going accordin' to plan!</i>

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.340
<i>The brush along the road is drying out...</i>

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.300
<i>I can see the grade level of the asphalt!</i>

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.370
<i>I've got it! He's telling me to do that!</i>

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.770
<i>This is the only spot! It's my last chance!</i>

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.450
What?! Such speed!

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.450
<i>What the hell just happened?!</i>
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.850
- Here they come!
- Which one's in front?

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
They came in side-by-side!

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.820
If either of them strays
even slightly from the line,

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.930
they'll both smash into the concrete wall!

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.500
<i>I lost.</i>

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.020
<i>Me, a local... done in by fallen leaves!</i>

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.020
<i>Still, he's really great, that Takumi Fujiwara!</i>

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.700
The Eight-Six won.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:44.220
Looks like Kogashiwa spun
out right before the goal.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:45.820
Ah...

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:48.380
Big brother!

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.780
Shall we go, Keisuke?

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.530
Yeah.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.260
<i>Takumi Fujiwara... He's going to be big.</i>

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.940
<i>The Gunma area alone won't</i>
<i>be enough to contain him.</i>

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:05.580
<i>I understand full well why</i>
<i>Ryosuke has his eye on him. But...</i>

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.810
<i>At some point, he will overtake</i>
<i>even Ryosuke as a driver.</i>

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.300
I see. Understood. We'll pack up here, too.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:16.540
It's over! The Eight-Six won!

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.060
Yeah! Takumi won!

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.780
He did it! Incredible!

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.780
This will be the start of a
new legend of the Eight-Six!

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:26.620
Incredible isn't he, Akina's Eight-Six?!

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.740
Hey now, no crying, lketani!

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:30.820
I'm just so happy...

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:34.090
I'm going to cry, too!

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:44.260
I appreciate your skillful handling.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.580
Thanks to that, we didn't
have to get into a wreck.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:52.740
This is my dad's car, so I wanted
to give it back without any dents.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.580
Same here.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:59.500
I passed by this car once before in Akina.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.180
In that moment, I thought to myself

01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:06.060
that this might be one
opponent I couldn't beat.

01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.060
I never planned on going
up against your dad, but...

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.020
...that's how intense of an impression I got.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:18.300
And I ended up losing, so I guess
my impression was on the mark.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.540
It was a shock to lose on my home turf,

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.420
but that was a good experience you gave me.

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:26.020
You and your dad are both incredible.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:29.300
Let's do this again somewhere.
I'll sharpen my skills first...

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.210
See you.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.980
It sure is cold today! Takumi,
you got any pocket warmers?!

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.860
Hell no, I don't!

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:05.330
The cold sure sucks, huh?
That harsh wind blowing...

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:11.300
Takumi, what do you think
you'll do after graduation?

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.340
Graduation, huh?

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.180
Yeah! You don't plan on
going to college, right?

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.740
- I guess not...
- So you goin' to vocational school?

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.700
Uh...

01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:26.700
If you haven't made any plans yet,
why not work here with me?

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.100
Here?

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.180
I'm thinking of asking the manager

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:35.420
to make me a full-time
employee here come April.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.020
You should do that, too.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.610
While you're spacin' out,
more and more time will slip on by!

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.130
See you!

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.140
Isn't it a little different from before? Your car.

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.490
Your seat's different, and how
it runs feels different, too.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:11.620
Say, Takumi, what are you doing for Christmas?

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.540
Nothing really.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.020
Don't you have a party or
something at your house and stuff?

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.460
Since I was a kid, we've never
done anything special for Christmas.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.820
It's not like we've got a mom at home, so...

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:30.580
Anyway, enough about that.
What did you want to talk to me about?

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:34.740
I... I broke up with the guy in the Benz.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:37.460
H-Hey, I don't care about that!

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.220
You're lying.

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:43.740
If you really didn't care,
you wouldn't be ignoring me!

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:47.740
You're ignoring me because
you've got me on your mind, right?!

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.660
In the summer, you and I went
to the beach... We even kissed.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.060
You're mad because you feel
like you've been betrayed, right?

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.090
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.860
It's cold... It's already winter, huh?

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.460
I... I want us to be close, like we were before.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.380
I don't!

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:24.610
I can't just switch my way of thinking like that!

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.100
I can't accept that!

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:37.570
I won't give up! I'll make up with you for sure!

01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.970
There's one thing I want to ask you.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:57.580
You're pretty popular. You could
find plenty of guys to go with, right?

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.810
This isn't like you. Why choose me?!

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.650
"Why?" There's no reason...

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.010
Because I like you of course, why else?!

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:48.170
Thank you very much!

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.420
Iketani!

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:54.900
This weather feels like it's gonna
start snowing or something, huh?

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:57.420
It certainly is cold today.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.300
More importantly, Itsuki,
what are you doing for Christmas?

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.460
What am I doing? It's obvious, isn't it?!

01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:06.660
As I thought, a party with your friends?

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.380
After all, this is your last
Christmas in high school...

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:12.460
Incorrect! I am working, sir, working!

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.900
I have to trade out the
Levin tires on my beloved car

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:19.660
with winter-use studless ones!

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:24.980
Just like me at your age.
And what about Takumi?

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:26.570
Uh, Takumi...

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:31.500
Man, he can really space out, huh?

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.090
Especially so today...

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:43.010 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.410
Hey Pops, I...

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:54.980
Um, I'm gonna be graduating soon, right? So...

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:57.280

it'll still be rough being alone.

Hey, you there. That looks heavy and all,

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.140
so if you came to see
my son about something,

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:17.620
I think he'll be back soon,
so come in and have a cup of tea.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:19.850

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.260
Oh! So that's what that big thing was!

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:41.300
It's cute, isn't it? Look, the tree even has this...

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.250

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.820
Friggin' Takumi sure is late.
Where's he wanderin' around at?

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.660
What time were you supposed to meet?

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.500
No, uh, we didn't make any arrangements.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.930
This is an unannounced,
"gatecrash" Christmas party.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:11.770
- This, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:21.900
This hit me a minute ago...

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.820
You're the girl who used to call
now and then last summer, right?

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.820
Yes...

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:32.220
When those calls suddenly stopped,
I wondered what was up...

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:37.660
A lot happened... It looked
like Takumi started hating me.

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.700
I didn't want us to graduate
with things like this.

01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:45.740
I've been trying hard,
but Takumi just won't forgive me...

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:50.540
I don't know the particulars,
but Takumi ain't one to strut around

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:53.860
choosin' who or who not to forgive.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:58.340
I think he probably doesn't really hate ya.

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.620
He may be just a kid, but he's as stubborn
as an old man about some things.

01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:06.620
Once his mind is set, he totally
refuses to compromise about it.

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.660
What's more, at times like that,

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:12.970
his attitude can be exactly the
opposite of what he really thinks.

I've loved Christmas
ever since I was a little kid.

That's why I wanted to spend
Christmas with you, Takumi.

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.730
You said before, right?
You'd never had a Christmas before...

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:32.140

Say, Takumi, what are you
doing after you graduate?

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:28.220
I haven't decided yet. What about you?

I've sort of gone along
with the flow up till now,

nothing good will come of it.

spacing out! Wipe the windows!

Working to save money is really hard!

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.780

O-Okay. Cheeseburger
and a shake, one of each.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.940
Why don't we go for a drive when
you're off work? I'll give ya a ride.

Oh, yeah? It's normal, baby, normal.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.260
You've changed, too. Like, more adult...

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:16.660
You're sexier than before!

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.340
Hey, you got a man?

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:21.340
That's really none of your business, is it?

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.740
Well, when you say it like that,
it means ya don't!

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.380
In that case, hook up with me!

out of your head, can ya?

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.540
I'll get out here. Stop!

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.540
Hello? Natsuki?

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:13.220
Hello? What's happened?

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.260
Hello? Hello?

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.660
This doesn't feel like
she was messing around...

01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:20.820

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.530
Lake Akina!

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:27.740
You said "Takumi" or somethin' just now, huh?

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:33.740
Don't tell me the guy you like
is that friggin' Fujiwara!

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.180
Your face tells me that it is!

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.980
Shit!

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:41.140
You gotta be kidding me, Natsuki.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:45.620
Of all people, you had to go
and get chummy with <i>him?</i>

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:48.980
I think it's time you shut
the hell up, before I make you!

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.740
Just who do you think you are?!

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.490
That ain't no way to talk to your seniors...!

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.460
I don't wanna friggin' remember that!

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:02.220
Takumi...

01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:05.260

Why, you!

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:11.180
If you're gonna call for help,
then think about who you're callin'

01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.780
Fujiwara can't make it out here.
He doesn't even have a car!

01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:19.860
He'll come. Takumi can race
mountain roads very fast.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.300
He's... got a car?!

01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.940
- Shit! Come on!
- That hurts! Let go!

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:28.460
- Shut up! Get in the car!
- No! Don't pull me!

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:30.660
Hurry up and do it!

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.170

If we stay here, people can
come by and bother us.

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.340
We'll go down the mountain, change locations.

Takumi!

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:23.460
No way!

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.290
That was too fast!

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:42.660
Takumi came... He came for me!

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:46.730
I wondered what kinda car he had,
and it's some beat-up old jalopy!

01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:52.220
Don't go yelping over a little drift like that!

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:58.100
Natsuki! Sorry, but there's no way
that car can catch up to mine!

01:25:58.100 --> 01:26:02.300
Takumi can catch up. He's a great driver!

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:05.900
Ain't gonna happen. It's not about
whether his driving's good or bad.

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.340
I've got four-wheel drive!

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:10.340
Everyone in the world knows...

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:13.010
...four-wheel drive rocks on snowy roads!

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.860
Mad speed like this, even on snowy roads!

01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.980
Once we take these three curves,

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:42.210
Fujiwara's car will be far away and outta sight!

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.900
Wha?!

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.180
That's impossible!

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.810
Dammit!

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.380
I-it can't be! My four-wheel drive,

01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.900
beaten by a rear-wheel drive piece of junk!

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:01.260
It's not your car's fault.

01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:03.020
It's probably just because you drive slow.

01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:06.540
What?! Bitch, you got some nerve,
makin' fun of me like that!

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.690
Keep your eyes on the road or we'll crash!

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.300
Shit! This guy just won't quit!

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:18.540
How about this?!

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:20.860
No good.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.730
It won't turn!

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.970
Please! Don't hit us!

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.260
Takumi!

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.940
Natsuki.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:44.500
Takumi, you came...

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:47.340
What the heck happened?
I didn't know what was going on,

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:49.940
so I came racing down here.

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.980
Whose car is that?
It's someone you know, right?

01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:57.730
We'll talk in the car. Let's go, Takumi.

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.460
Are you angry?

01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:09.740
I'm sorry. Is it because I got in Miki's car?

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.460
Whatever.

01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.020
Takumi...

01:28:14.020 --> 01:28:18.100
I'll take you, so just go straight home.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.090
No. I can't go home with things like this.

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:27.140
If I don't say this now, I feel like
I won't be able to say it again.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:30.100
So I want you to listen.

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.260
The person I was dating before...

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.460
...the guy you knew about,
the one with the Benz...

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:44.780
I got money from him.
I really regret doing that now.

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.900
Back then, in exchange for money,
I felt like more and more,

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:52.060
I was losing something important.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:56.140
The real reason I started my job
is I thought that if I worked,

01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:59.500
I could get back whatever it was I'd lost.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.860
And I wanted you to see how hard I was...

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:08.090
I wanted you to <i>look,</i>
and know how hard I was working.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:14.740
Oh, oh no! Crying in front
of a guy is so uncool!

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:18.260
I definitely didn't want to do it, yet I...

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:20.180
This is terrible!

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:24.020
When did I turn into such a crybaby?

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.540
I'm sorry...

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:28.370
I'm sorry, Takumi.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:38.020
I have something I want to say, too.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:41.780
It's how I really feel.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:46.720
I... I like you!

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:13.380

01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:15.980
Yes. Please!

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:20.220
You still haven't answered
whether you'll join my new team.

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.220
I'd like to decide that based on this race.

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.090

01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:32.380

You start and I'll come behind.
The place will be Akagi.

01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:40.580
I have no illusions of winning.

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:43.340
It's just, last time was at Akina, so...

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:47.500
This time, I wanted to race on your home turf.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:51.580
I feel like if we do that, I'll find the answer.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.530
Very well. This Saturday. I look forward to it.

Yes. Just a bit of advice will be okay.

Either way would be fine.

Hey, Takumi! So this is where you've been.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:06.120
Graduation... It's enough
to make you cry, huh?

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:09.580
Hey, what are you doing after this?

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.380
You wanna come to my place and trade
memories of the bloom of our youth?

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:17.340
Uh, I... That is...

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:20.060
Could it be, you and Mogi are,
just the two of you...?!

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.260
Well, it's just...

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:23.220
No worries, no worries! You go on.

01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.180
After all, I am a lonely driver!!

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:30.020
I'm gonna trade stories with
lketani at the gas station!

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.560
I'm not lonely!

01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:46.820
The lake's ice... It's completely melted, huh?

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.020
It'll get warmer and warmer...

01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:51.850
...won't it?

01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:12.780
Takumi, you got that job at the
local delivery company, right?

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:18.900
Yeah. I can't even think of
a life separated from cars...

01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.130
Being separated is terrible, isn't it?

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:25.290
I knew about this, but I hate it!

01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:30.820
Come on, Takumi, come to Tokyo with me!

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.410
Come on!

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.780
I'm staying.

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.850
There's something I've been
thinking about since last fall...

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:45.420
What is my dream?

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:51.500
I thought about it all through
the winter, and I finally realized it.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:57.180
I like to ride cars, and I want
to be faster than anyone else...

01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:00.340
...so I want to become a pro racer!

01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.500
That's why I'm going to stay behind here.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.100
"That's why..."?

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:07.980
A new team will be forming,
and I want to join it

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:10.980
and learn all kinds of things.

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:14.940
I don't want to lose to anyone...

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.460
I want to stand at the top as the best racer!

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:23.330
<i>Awesome! That's awesome, Takumi!</i>

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:29.300
