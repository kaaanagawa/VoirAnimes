WEBVTT

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.990
No oncoming traffic.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.030
You can go all out!

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.160
All right! You're doing great, Mako!

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.140
Yeah...

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.560
What's the matter?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.160
Is something on your mind?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.290
Mako?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.670
It's nothing.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.150
Okay, we're going for another run, Sayuki.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.930
Ah, the weather's awesome.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.780
Yeah, seriously.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.670
It makes me feel like driving somewhere instead of working.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.530
And if we could have a cute girl in our passenger seats...

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.030
Woah!

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.990
Why are you acting surprised?

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.180
How long were you standing there, Kenji-senpai?

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.370
What? Am I not supposed to be here?

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.480
Well, it's not a problem or anything.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.490
You must be bored.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.350
It's Takumi.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.040
Yo.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.020
Hello.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.220
D doesn't have a race this week, right?

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.430
Yeah.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.210
So you're bored too?

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.960
Well, it's not like I'm bored, but...

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.260
I don't have work today or anything, so...

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.230
No problem, no problem.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.700
You came here 'cause you have nowhere better to go, right?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.910
Bullseye.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.830
So how's your job at the shipping company?

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.660
Have you gotten used to it?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.850
Yeah, but I've been busy because I'm involved with D.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.850
Hey, tell us about your battle the other day!

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.960
What're your feelings about your first victory as a member of Project D?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.250
Well... um...

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.700
how should I put it?

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.520
It was a relief.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.390
A relief?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.840
What, that's it?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.230
You're not gonna say something like, 
"I knew victory was mine at that point"?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.050
I mean,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.110
I just drove like Ryosuke-san told me to.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.750
But I was happy that I won,

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.080
even though it was a close battle.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.110
They praised me and said I did well.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.120
Racing outside the prefecture must be a lot of pressure.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.540
It'd be embarrassing if you challenged someone, traveled to their site, and lost.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.630
But I don't even think about things like that when I'm racing.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.840
Instead of things like wanting to win or how I can't afford to lose,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.270
I think more about driving better than I did the last time.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.980
I see.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.560
I haven't even driven on the mountain pass,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.170
much less been in a battle recently...

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.110
Say, Takumi, could you lend me some time tonight if you're not busy?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.870
Sure.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.820
I don't have anything going on.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.520
I'm gonna try pushing myself on the mountain pass.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.560
I want you to sit next to me and teach me.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.330
All right?

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.060
That's a great idea!

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.420
Let's all get together on Akina again and have a blast!

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.840
Sure!

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.840
Yeah.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.310
I understand.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.210
It really makes me happy.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.320
But...

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.680
please let me think about it for a little bit.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.640
It's been awhile since the four of us came up here.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.140
Yeah, I've only been driving on Akina for deliveries these days.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.150
It must be nerve-wracking to drive on a new course for your battles.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.850
Of course.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.130
Here at Akina, we know about the minute details of the course,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.360
but things are completely different when it's your first time on a new course.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.120
Even though it's unavoidable as a member of Project D, it's gotta be scary.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.340
Yeah.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.640
Hey, let's get started soon, Iketani-senpai!

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.470
Kenji-senpai and I will stick right behind you in my 85.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.050
If you're too slow, I'm gonna pass you.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.780
Now you've said it.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.660
All right, Takumi, please get in.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.140
Sure.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.630
I'm counting on you.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.790
If something comes to mind, please let me know, no matter how small the detail.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.150
I understand.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.200
Well then, let's see what kind of driving he'll show us.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.030
This is exciting.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.290
Here I go!

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.250
He's started!

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.340
Don't get left behind.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.540
I know.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.340
Go!

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.510
It's the first corner.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.350
A-all right...

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.270
Not bad!

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.530
H-how was that just now, Takumi?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.240
Both your line selection and timing weren't too bad.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.730
Oh yeah?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.130
His acceleration out of the corner is pretty good!

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.150
That's surprising.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.510
All right,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.260
this feels good!

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:52.650
He's good.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.730
Not bad, Iketani!

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.450
How's that?

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.780
I'm in a groove today.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.950
The upcoming S-curve is gonna be a problem though.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.960
Iketani-senpai tends to push it too far when he gets cocky.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.030
Next up is the S-curve!

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.800
Yeah!

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.610
Here goes,

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.300
the S-curve!

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.640
Iketani-senpai,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.770
you're pushing it too much!

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:28.770
What?

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.610
O-oh my God!

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.940
Oh man,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.750
he's done it.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.570
Well, we knew this would happen.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.350
Thank God, no scratches anywhere.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.100
You should at least change your right rear tire though.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.710
You're right.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.210
I'll change it when I get back.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.400
Man, I still need a lot of practice.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.650
But I guess I couldn't get as good as Takumi, even if I did practice.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.550
It's just like you to be so wishy-washy.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.780
W-what's that supposed to mean?

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.370
And you know,

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.670
it's about time you got over that other thing too.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.290
What's this all of a sudden?

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.500
What am I supposed to get over?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.430
I'll take this opportunity to be blunt.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.720
Forget about Mako-chan.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.970
M-Mako-chan? What about her?

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.230
At this rate, you're gonna be single for the rest of your life.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.400
You might lose out when a new opportunity comes your way,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.980
because you're still dragging on about Mako-chan.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.210
Hmm, that's very possible.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.420
Don't exaggerate things like that.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.690
That's bad luck.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.830
I'm not exaggerating.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.700
Watching you seriously worries me.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.090
It's none of your business.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.600
First of all, I don't wanna hear it from another single man.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.620
N-no! Iketani-senpai.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.580
It'll be the end once you say that to Kenji-senpai!

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.330
I...

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.870
I want a girlfriend too!

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.470
But you see...

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.290
You can't help what you don't have!

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.170
Are you two supposed to be a pair of comedians?

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.480
You might have a point.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.110
Either way, you...

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.420
What is it?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.730
Isn't your mind still filled with Mako-chan?

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.110
Why don't you try contacting her again?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.990
That's impossible. Out of the question.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.240
I wouldn't be in a bind if I could do that.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.920
I've tried many times. I just wuss out at the last second.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.830
Once you miss your chance,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.290
it's over.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.840
No kidding.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:08.180
I've lost track of how many times I wanted to call Kazumi-chan.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.790
You gradually lose your opportunities to make a move as time goes by...

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.390
It's already been half a year since then.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.350
What's the problem with half a year?

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.700
It's too late.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.070
There's no way a cute girl like that would stay single for long.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.700
You don't know that.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.200
Mako-chan isn't the same as those typical light-hearted girls.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.080
She wouldn't like it if I called her!

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.250
Anyway, it's too late.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.380
I'm convinced of that much.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.720
He's really holding it back.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.330
I guess he needs some fated encounter to break him out.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.450
A day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of Mako-chan.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.270
I've always thought that I need to apologize about that day.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:24.650
But you know what, Moon? That's what's so hard about this...

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.360
Huh?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.840
Hey, a shooting star!

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.020
Man, a memorial service? What a drag.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.230
It's kinda busy.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.300
Is it because it's a holiday?

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.050
Say, Koichirou.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:53.780
Huh?

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.660
Is there a rest area coming up?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.900
What?

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.590
Can't be helped I guess...

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.160
Hurry up, Mom!

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.880
We don't have a lot of time.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.010
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.140
Sheesh.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.530
The rest of the world is on vacation, huh.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.650
There are couples everywhere I look!

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.650
So where do you wanna go after that?

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.500
Well, anywhere's fine!

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.110
I want to go on a drive with a girl like that too.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.660
To think that the person sitting in the passenger's seat for my roadtrip is my mom...

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.890
It's depressing to the megaton-level.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.930
What is it, Mom?

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.800
Stare...

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:53.560
Just as I thought! It's Iketani!

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.300
S-Sayuki-chan!

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.190
I thought it was someone else because you were dressed like that.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:02.060
Hey Mako! It was Iketani after all!

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.560
What are you doing? Come over here already!

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.900
Mako-chan?

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.880
Hello.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.690
I-it's been awhile.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.350
Hey, what are you getting flustered for?

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.440
You sure are a weird man.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.220
W-well...

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.710
But man, this brings back memories. How's everyone doing?

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.760
Y-yeah...

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.880
Takumi-kun's sure amazing!

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.260
I've been making sure to check Project D's home page.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.100
Is this reality?

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.480
Is that really Mako-chan in front of me?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.840
At 8pm...

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.690
I'll be waiting for you under the billboard...

00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.510
that I first met you at.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.490
Would you like to meet there

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:09.980
and spend the night together somewhere quiet, where we can be alone?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.060
Mako-chan is...

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.860
Mako-chan is right in front of my eyes...

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.320
Hey now, Iketani,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.370
have you been listening to me at all?

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:23.020
Huh?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.520
What's the matter with you, spacing out like that?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.990
Oh sorry, Sayuki-chan.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:31.520
I just remembered that there was something I just had to tell Mako-chan.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.860
Huh?!

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.940
I... need to apologize to you, Mako-chan.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.460
I'm really sorry

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.330
for not making it to our meeting on time.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:46.370
On that day, the highway was really backed up.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.030
No, it wasn't just that.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.270
It's also because I left late.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.260
Either way, it was past 10

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.090
by the time I got to our meeting spot.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.220
What? You can't be serious...

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.600
I waited there until 10pm exactly.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.910
No!

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.620
You must be joking.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.540
Mako-chan, you waited two hours for someone like me?!

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.600
Yes.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.860
So back then...

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.550
Could it be that I missed her...

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.730
by just a minute or two?!

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.410
I really must've been out of luck.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:27.380
No,

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.770
if I hadn't hesitated back then and left sooner...

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.670
Koichirou, what are you doing?

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.600
Gah!

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.710
Mom?!

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.540
It's nothing at all!

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.450
Hey, we'll be late if we don't get going.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.300
Your aunts will nag us.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.850
I know that!

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.120
I'll be right there, so you don't need to come over here. You're embarrassing me!

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.460
God dammit!

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.340
Why do things always go like this?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.040
My head's starting to spin,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.820
but I'm not gonna back down!

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.740
Mako-chan,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.080
I have other things I want to tell you,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.210
but I don't have time today.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.780
Um...

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.500
so...

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.480
I...

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.960
Me too.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.270
I have something I want to tell you too, Iketani-san.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.660
Please give me a call when you get the time.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:24.930
I'll be waiting.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.980
M-Mako-chan...

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.200
I got it! I'll be sure to contact you.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.550
W-well then...

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.330
Yeah. See you again.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.830
Hey, what's the matter, Koichirou?

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.670
Who's that girl?

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.100
Oh, Koichirou...

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.250
Hey...

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.420
I don't remember how I got back to the car.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:01.200
My mind was blown for the next 30 minutes.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.840
I have no doubts about it.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.180
This was surely destiny.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.750
What?!

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.910
You met Mako-chan?

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.900
Is that true, Iketani-senpai?

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.890
That's right.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.380
Really, really, really for real.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.850
I can't believe such a coincidence could happen.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.330
I ran right into her at a rest area on the highway.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:51.640
I see...

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.100
I'm convinced for sure this time.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:01.100
This is my "last chance" that's been given to me by my revered ancestors.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.100
D'oh!

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.230
Why is it your ancestors?

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.910
Iketani-senpai, I thought your word of choice was "God"?

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.120
Not this time, because I was on my way to a memorial service.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.120
This guy has a surprisingly religious side to him.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:21.140
I can tell that time is being rewound at an incredible pace inside me right now.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.130
It's as if I'm in a time machine!

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.530
Huh.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:32.420
It's as if I can almost go back to under that Kamameshi restaurant billboard.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.730
Thank you, revered ancestors.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.230
I... will never repeat the same mistake!

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.370
That's right.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.410
Good luck!

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.340
Yeah!

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:49.770
My difficulties of the past six months have drilled into me the importance of acting with courage.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:51.490
I'll score for sure this time.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.510
I'm going to make a move on Mako-chan!

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.610
An aura!

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.300
He's emitting an aura!!

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.010
I'm not sure what's going on, but you're impressing me.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.470
You've sure grown.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.300
I can't believe you're the same indecisive Iketani.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.040
Yeah, really.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.690
Things really worked out.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.020
I'm happy for you, Iketani.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.200
Good luck this time.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.960
I think you definitely have a shot.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.270
Make sure you get your beloved Mako-chan!

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.360
Whoa.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.110
He sure seems confident.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.640
Why?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.340
Why am I hesitating at the last moment?

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.020
I can't decide. What am I supposed to do?

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.120
Mako.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.170
There's a car coming up.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.650
Okay.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.330
Did you see that?

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.010
They were women.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.260
Oh?

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.910
Female racers, huh?

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.470
Not bad...

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.880
but you should be able to go faster.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.060
Okay.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.340
I'll go for another run.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.150
Here they come, here they come.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.530
Hey, missies!

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.090
Hey!

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.510
You're looking pretty good.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.970
Say, won't you give us a tip or two?

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.440
Hey now, you're gonna totally ignore us?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.830
Hah! Acting so stuck up...

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.480
you two probably came up here looking for men.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.980
They must be full of themselves just because they can drive a little.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.110
Drive? They're just women in the end.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.990
So what if we're female?

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.270
Oh, now she's heating up.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:44.120
Getting looked down on just for being female pisses us off like nothing else.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.870
How scary!

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:49.430
So, you wanna race us?

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.590
A single downhill run.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.040
What do you think, Mako?

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.340
If we don't accept, they'll say we ran away because we're women.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.730
That's the way! Let's do it.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.680
Yeah.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.930
We'll go with the leader-chaser format.
Leave the other in the dust or overtake to win.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.260
You guys can lead.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.700
All right.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.490
Let's have them cry like babies.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.020
Let's go then!

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.670
Do those women really think that they can beat me?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.380
What should we do when we win?

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.160
Maybe we can get some...

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.330
Good,

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.460
we'll let them run for a little bit.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.020
We'll take it to them at the exit of corner C-121 like usual.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.930
Okay.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.180
They're better than we thought.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.320
Yeah,

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.200
but...

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.210
they're not anyone I'd lose to.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.270
Hey, start trying a little.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.720
They're sticking right to us!

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:18.470
This is impossible.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.700
What's going on?

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.200
Amazing.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.980
You're amazing, Mako.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.980
You're definitely faster than when we raced against Takumi-kun.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.190
Your entry speed into corners,

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.880
braking, choice of lines...

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.370
they're all perfect.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.370
We don't need to wait until C-121.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.590
I'm passing him on the next corner!

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.300
N-no way!

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.100
Hey!

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.450
Unbelievable!

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.500
You've become independent, Mako...

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.820
Well then, Kenji, Itsuki,

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.370
I'll be on my way.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.070
What?

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.430
Already?

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.600
You sure are leaving early.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.000
Weren't you meeting her at night?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.840
I can't be careful enough.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.590
After all, it wouldn't be funny if I was late again today.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.720
Even so, don't you think you're going too soon?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.360
It's fine.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.370
Mako-chan waited two hours for me.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.850
If you think about that, getting there two hours early is nothing.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.400
Well, you have a point when you put it that way.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.270
Either way, I'm off.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.650
I can't fail if I'm a step ahead on every move.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.760
Good luck!

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.550
Hurrah! Hurrah!

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.430
Iketani-senpai!

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.500
So he's gone?

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.250
Iketani-senpai's unbelievably invested in this.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:44.420
Yeah,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.380
his last mistake must really have smarted.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.200
I wonder what'll happen...

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.470
It makes me nervous.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:55.230
From what I've heard from Iketani, I think he's got a pretty good chance...

00:29:55.930 --> 00:30:00.480
It sounds like Mako-chan was waiting all this time for him to contact her too.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.290
In that case, I think something big's about to happen!

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.600
Iketani had a serious crush on Mako-chan, after all...

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.660
It'd be like a dream for him if a girl like that became his girlfriend.

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.160
The thought of it makes me jealous.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.710
And what about you, Kenji-senpai?

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:22.870
Well to be honest, I used to be really jealous too.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.870
Mako-chan's pretty, after all.

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.060
Yeah, really.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.050
That's to be expected of any man!

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.390
But you know,

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.930
I truly feel like cheering him on now.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.310
I get the feeling that I'll get an earful of bragging on a daily basis,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.100
but I'll take it for his sake.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:42.860
You're bringing tears to my eye! Now that's a manly friendship!

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.070
I just can't turn my back on him.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.280
I worry more about him than about myself.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.980
That's true.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.750
I want Iketani-senpai to find happiness too.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.190
Hey now,

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.020
stop cheering for Iketani...

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.150
and go find a girlfriend or two for yourselves already.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.380
Youth is short.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.860
Please don't remind me...

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.540
My heart is aching.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.370
Kazumi-chan...

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.810
And I have no one...

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.800
I'm surprisingly calm.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.870
Even though I'm about to confess my feelings to a girl for the first time in my life...

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.610
"Please date me."

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:43.870
I just need to say that one sentence.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.340
I have no expectations.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.610
I'm just going to throw my everything at her.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.490
When I think about my half year of constant regret,

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:54.840
I have no doubts holding me back!

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:10.070
Oh boy...

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.530
The highway was empty, so I really did get here two hours early.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.220
Oh well.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.330
Now I'll be 100% on time.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.740
When I think about the six months leading up to today,

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.780
two hours is nothing.

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.050
Excuse me...

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:53.820
Huh?

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.980
I saw that you've been sitting there

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.720
and don't seem to be in a hurry.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.080
Do you think you could listen to what I have to say?

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.920
What?!

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:15.420
Your tour bus left while you were eating some kamameshi?!

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.050
That's right.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.340
So I have a favor to ask of you.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:26.310
I'm very sorry for the trouble, but could you drive me to my hotel in Karuizawa?

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:29.310
I'd really rather not...

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.650
I know it's a lot of trouble,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:37.000
but I'm not familiar with this area and I don't know my left from my right.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.220
I was really starting to get lonely.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.340
Won't you?

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.330
As I expected...

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.110
Oh man...

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.880
I'm starting to feel sorry for him.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.380
I could make it to Karuizawa and back in an hour.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.530
All right,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.470
I'll take you there, gramps.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.570
Huh?

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.870
Really?

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.740
Oh, thank you.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:13.120
Please, please, you're a good person!

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.910
Okay, hurry and get in.

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:15.730
Okay.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.120
Are you traveling by yourself, gramps?

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.510
That's right.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.880
At my age, traveling is about the only fun in your life.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.590
I see...

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:43.470
Spring, summer, fall, winter:

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.180
they all have their own flavors.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.500
Now that he mentions it, it's spring already.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.000
The seasons sure go by quickly.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.410
Oh yeah, where in Karuizawa is your hotel, gramps?

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.760
Well...

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.910
I think I had a pamphlet.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.590
Oh, here it is.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:22.050
I'd like for you to take me here.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.690
What? Kitakaru Grand Hotel?

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.800
Wait a minute, gramps,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.830
although it is Karuizawa, this is in North Karuizawa!

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:34.650
It is Karuizawa, no?

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.200
North Karuizawa is in Gunma Prefecture.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.970
It's far away! I can't do that.

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.150
I can't say no to that face!

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.070
Crap, what a nightmare.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.000
Two hours is barely enough for North Karuizawa...

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.290
Please give me a call when you get the time.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.510
I'll be waiting.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.660
M-Mako-chan...

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.760
I got it! I'll be sure to contact you.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.800
W-well then...

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.920
Yeah.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.460
See you again.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:15.190
No, but if I give it my best, I'll be able to get back on time.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.040
Gramps, I'm gonna step on it.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.550
Please hang on!

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.870
He's not here yet.

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:02.380
I got here first again.

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.250
I'm such an idiot!

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.520
Half a year ago,

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.430
I messed everything up by being two hours late.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.700
Today, I messed up by being two hours early.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.210
This is too much, revered ancestors!

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:35.310
If only I was Takumi at a time like this...

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.360
Shit!

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.500
Either way, I need to hurry.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.470
If I speed, I should only be about 30 minutes late.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.580
I've trained my driving technique for a time like this!

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.020
I... I've done it...

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.520
I hit a rock on the shoulder of the road...

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.740
and burst a tire.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.140
This is the worst!

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:11.760
I don't have a spare!

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:26.940
You should at least change your right rear tire though.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.660
That's right!

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.170
I changed my tire back then and...

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:31.680
Shit!

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.700
And at a time like this!

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.370
Oh yeah, I need to call her at least...

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.550
Why is my battery out?!

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.440
I can't waste time here!

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.590
Mako-chan, I'm so sorry!

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:57.180
Mako-chan!

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.710
I wonder what happened to Iketani-san...?

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.000
He's not even calling.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.170
I wonder...

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.860
if he forgot?

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.250
There's not even a public phone in the mountains like this.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:34.820
Ouch...

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.300
shit.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.410
My heart's about to burst.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.800
I need to find a phone!

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.710
A racer is racing down the mountain pass on his own feet...

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.720
This isn't even funny!

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.520
Hello?

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.190
Iketani-san!

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.820
I'm so glad to hear from you. Where are you now?

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.660
Huh? You have a flat?

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.970
I'm really sorry, Mako-chan.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:46.710
Not only was I late, I had to have you come get me...

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.170
I'm really pathetic.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.770
No, please don't worry about it.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.280
We got to meet in the end.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.670
Yeah.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.470
Anyway,

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.870
what was it that you wanted to tell me the other day, Iketani-san?

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:05.640
Huh?

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.090
That's...

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.670
well...

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:10.200
Crap.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.400
I've totally lost my momentum because of how pathetic this situation is.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.480
O-oh yeah,

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.410
you said you had something to say too, Mako-chan.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.260
What was it about?

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:34.630
So,

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.360
I know it's rather sudden...

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.950
but I'm moving to Tokyo.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.150
Huh?

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.490
Tokyo?

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:02.180
There was a promotion where a certain publishing company would sponsor an amateur to drive in races for a year...

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:07.020
and that person's experiences would be published in a magazine.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:07.890
Okay.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.280
I applied for the heck of it,

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:14.400
and for whatever reason...

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.900
You got accepted?

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.490
That's amazing!

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.690
You're going to be a racer!

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:27.440
Although it's just a race series sponsored by car makers with only minimal modifications allowed to vehicles...

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.950
That's still amazing!

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.010
Yeah,

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.000
I hear that a huge sum of money is needed for someone to race for a full year.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.320
I couldn't possibly pay for it myself.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.400
I'm sure.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.880
I really wasn't sure,

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.390
but I don't think a chance like this will come my way ever again.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.520
I just had to talk to you about this, Iketani-san.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.990
I think it's all thanks to you...

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.070
that I've been able to keep driving this long, Iketani-san.

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.970
W-what are you talking about, Mako-chan?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.450
That's not true at all.

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.380
No, I don't think I would've had this opportunity

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:10.830
if I hadn't met you, Iketani-san.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:13.370
Oh man...

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.790
Either way, I'm glad to hear that.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:19.550
Congratulations, Mako-chan.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:27.330
I can't believe that someone I know is going to become a racer!

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:31.810
I'll brag about you to all my friends when you become famous!

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.020
When you do, please give me your first autograph.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.360
Oh no, what are you talking about?

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.910
No, I'm serious.

00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:39.950
I'm impressed.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.230
You're great, Mako-chan!

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.520
She's actually happy about it.

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.510
Well yeah,

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:50.890
why wouldn't she be.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.270
Oh, I've been doing all the talking,

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.250
but I want to hear what you have to say too, Iketani-san.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.960
W-well,

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.750
what I had to say was...

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.220
This isn't good.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:06.260
Compared to what you just told me, it's nothing at all.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.140
That's not true, please tell me!

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.710
No, it really was nothing.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.600
See, I wanted to properly apologize for what happened last year.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.840
And it looks like I have your understanding already.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.780
So it's all right.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.400
Is that so?

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.450
Yeah.

00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:41.900
I actually want to tell her, "Don't go."

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:42.820
But...

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.570
But... I can't do it.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.430
Iketani-san...

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.930
Mako-chan...

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:59.240
Well, I need to call a tow truck to fix up my car and drive it home.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:03.070
I'm sorry, but do you think you can drop me off somewhere near a phone?

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:10.070
Okay?

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:31.970
What?!

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:36.010
So you came back without confessing your feelings?

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:37.690
I mean,

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.940
how could I say it under those circumstances?

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.440
You might say that, but your feelings will never reach her if you don't tell her!

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.260
It's okay.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:56.860
Since Mako-chan's leaving for Tokyo to start racing, confessing my feelings will only trouble her.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.200
But man...

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.990
It might make me feel good,

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.420
but that's only self-satisfaction.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:06.920
This was the right choice when you think about the other person's feelings.

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:19.240
Telling her, "Give it your best," and cheering her on is the best I can do.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.270
You're too nice...

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.440
Maybe.

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.720
That's pretty cold of Iketani.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:38.090
I thought he had feelings for you too.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:40.660
I really don't get men.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.600
It's okay, Sayuki.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.880
Now I can move on.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.110
Really?

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.520
To be honest, I was worried.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:52.450
Life in Tokyo seems tough.

00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:58.080
I wasn't confident that a wimp like me could become a racer.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.830
I was hesitant until the last minute,

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:06.030
so much so that I could've been swayed had someone told me not to go.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:11.470
But now I'm embarrassed that I even thought that.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:16.000
I'm sure Iketani-san was cold to me because he saw through all that.

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.840
He gave me a push on the back saying,

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:24.610
"Go give it a try with confidence,"

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.620
so that I won't leave any unnecessary regrets over here.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:28.980
That's what I'd like to think.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.730
That might be true.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:35.840
He does have an admirable side to him like that.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.950
I get a feeling that's true.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.650
Iketani,

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:46.270
do you really...

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:49.400
have no regrets?

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.890
Nope.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:53.250
It's tough,

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.360
but I have no regrets.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.200
This is how it was supposed to be.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:08.500
Mako...

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.470
Good luck!

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.760
I certify your talents.

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.830
Yeah,

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.720
I'll go as far as I can.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.910
I won't hesitate anymore.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.490
So this is the end for Impact Blue.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.690
It's a little sad.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:53.070
I need to practice more.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:56.970
I blew my tire at a time like that because my skills are still lacking.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.720
Will you go practice with me, Kenji?

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:03.670
Yeah.

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.290
Takumi told me this before,

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:29.300
but I guess I push it too far when I get pumped up.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:32.710
Next up is the S-curve.

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:33.920
All right!

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.490
This is the last run for Impact Blue.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.350
Please take a good look, Sayuki.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:48.280
Yeah,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.980
give me a refreshing run,

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:52.510
Impact Blue's shooting star.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:09.860
You still have some work to do. You're ballooning out too far to the outside.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:10.520
Okay.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.980
But this is great.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.730
When I'm driving like this, I can forget everything.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.380
I might not be as fast as Takumi,

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:22.290
but I must be a racer at heart too.

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:29.630
Street racers...

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.160
don't need girlfriends!
