Young Magazine 35th Anniversary Production

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.140
Bigger world, huh ?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.000
A car's gaining on us.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.150
A hillbilly from Akina is ten years too
 early to be putting pressure on me.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 I'll just leave him in the dust.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.400
<c.white>I can't believe this.
Is this really my Eight-Five ?!</c>

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.900
That's the Levin we saw earlier at Akina's peak.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.000
It's that Eight-Five Levin.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.400
Eight-Five ? Don't be stupid.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.550
There's no way a turtle like an
 Eight-Five can keep up with me.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.880
Takumi, you've got a frightening gaze.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.600
Itsuki, it might be a little scary, but just trust me.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.100
No. I'm scared enough.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.200
Now I'll show them the max potential 
of the car they mocked and laughed at.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300
That's definitely the Eight-Five from earlier !

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.000
<c.white>Huh ? What's wrong ?</c>

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.860
<c.white>I can't pick up speed on the downhill.</c>

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.300
<c.white>And these tires have no grip.</c>

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.490
<c.white>Once the car starts skidding, it doesn't stop.</c>

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.240
I can't shake it.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.200
The brat behind us is too good.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.450
He's so fast.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.770
<c.white>So slow...</c>

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.600
<c.white>I'd better do <i>it.</c></i>

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.000
What the hell...?!

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.000
How did I get passed ?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300
Those brats were lying.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.100
It's gotta be an Eight-Six, not an Eight-Five.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.200
Spoke too soon. That hideous roll...

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.700
And under-steering due to the roll...

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.000
But it's still fast. What's with that car ?!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.200
Enough ! That's enough, Takumi !

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.450
Here.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.660
Thank you.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.450
I never thought a car could be driven like that.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.440
It changed my view on life.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.740
I felt like I was in a whole new dimension.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.400
Did I scare you that much ?

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.540
I'm sorry.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.840
Those guys dissed your car so badly, so...

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.800
No need to apologize, Takumi. 
I'm so happy.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.550
It was my dream to have my own car.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.930
I worked so hard to buy this car thinking it was an Eight-Six, but it turned out to be an Eight-Five...

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.250
Did you hear that ?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.370
It's not an Eight-Six, but an AE85, an Eight-Five...

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.300
The Eight-Five's slower than a turtle.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.060
The body's identical to the Eight-Six, but the engine is SOHC, only good for a grandpa.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.650
My tears won't stop.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.550
I never thought I'd see anyone
 driving an Eight-Five these days.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.700
Well, it suits street-racer-wannabees.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.420
Try hard so you don't annoy the tourist bus driver.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.200
Man, I laughed so hard.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.620
But now I know better.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.620
The performance of a car doesn't matter.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.850
If I had skills, I could drive well, too.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.840
I've come to like this car very much.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.400
I'll treasure it.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.650
I'll practice hard.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.350
Even if someone mocks me, I won't give a damn.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.900
My Levin is awesome.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.370
You're right. I envy you.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.700
Oh, give me a break.
 You drive a genuine Eight-Six.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.900
That's my dad's car.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.100
I was really shocked when you...

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.210
...arrived at the gas station in this.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.340
Even if it's used, having your own car is amazing for a high school student.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.240
I really envy you, Itsuki.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.100
Takumi...

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.900
I suppose...

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.400
...having a few driving skills doesn't make you
 a street racer unless you own a car, does it ?

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.770
Iketani and Kenji own their own cars,
 and they take good care of them...

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.260
...like they're a part of them.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.780
Watching them makes me 
want to have my own car.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.900
Somehow, you've changed recently.
 You used to be so bored.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.500
Nice sound.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.210
Must be coming back 
from the mountain pass.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.860
The battle against Takahashi 
Ryosuke is soon, right, Takumi ?

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.750
Yeah.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.200
Do you think you can win ?

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.900
He's the real deal.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.040
He's very fast. 
Faster than anyone I've met.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.750
That's why I'm really excited.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.520
You have changed.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.700

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.600
Takumi !

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.000
Hey, Mogi.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.600
You don't work today, right ?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.400
Wanna hang out somewhere ?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.880
Fine with me.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.750

Mt. Komochi

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.150
Mt. Hotaka

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.500
Huh ? 
You're going to buy a car, Takumi ?

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.200
It's a long ways away, though.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.000
The pay from a summer job isn't enough at all.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.200
I was working part time without
 a goal, but now I've found one.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.250
A goal ?

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.060
That's wonderful.
 I don't have anything like that.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.800
Mine isn't that great.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.400
Probably just a dream until I get a full-time job...

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.550
Oh, don't say that. 
I'm sure you can afford one.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:03.600
 Until then, you have the Trueno.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.770
It's so cute. I like it a lot.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.350
Don't you like it ?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.300
I do.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.620
It's fun to drive, and it's a really great car, but...

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.640
...it's not my car.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.320
I didn't know you were into car racing.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.250
August 27 at 10 pm

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.250
I'll be waiting at the peak of Mt. Akina

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.250
Takahashi Ryosuke

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.290
A declaration of challenge ?
 It's like a period drama.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.650
Let's see, that's where the school is, right ?

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:51.000
 So, beyond that is Mt. Akagi ?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.760
And far beyond that is the ocean, right ?

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.840
Probably.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.550
So big...

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:07.490
We only know a small area. 
The world out there is so much bigger.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.280
So, this Saturday, huh ?

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.010
Right. Akagi Red Suns 
versus Akina Speed Stars.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:39.540
No, it's more like a downhill battle between
 Takahashi Ryosuke's RX-7 and Akina's Eight-Six.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.750
The mountain pass will
 become a festival site again.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:48.130
Your son has changed so much.
 He became Akina's hero in just one summer.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.160
His driving has changed.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.100
He was just a good driver, 
but he drives fast these days.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.700
He broke through a wall, which is a good sign.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.450
Hey, Bunta.
 Did you plan all this from the beginning...

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.400
...ever since you decided to 
let Takumi handle the delivery ?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.550
What do you mean ?

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.750
Like telling him to drive without spilling water in the cup, so he wouldn't damage the tofu.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.880
But you wanted to teach him the
 basics of weight transfer, didn't you ?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.200
I dunno.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.680
I think I was more concerned 
about the tofu in the beginning.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.850
But Takumi has <i>it.</i>

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:55.450
Eventually, I did start tuning the suspension, brakes, and transmission to match his growth.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.880
I admit I changed his driving style to my liking.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:07.600
What's the purpose ? Why are you 
giving him special driving training ?

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.530
I don't have any purpose, really.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.650
It's just fun to watch him getting better and better.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.800
He'll eventually surpass me, 
and do what he likes to do.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.600
Whatever it is, I hope 
he'll be ready, since I wasn't.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.410
I see.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:39.800
The view from here hasn't changed at all, 
even though the world's changing so rapidly.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.250
We stayed in this city, and we're exactly 
the same as we were in the old days.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.680
Iketani, I'm still not up for it.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.600
I don't think I can drive your car well because I've never driven anything other than the Eight-Six.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:13.100
I beg you, Takumi. I think I can learn
a lot, even if you just cruise around.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.700
So, what do you want me to do then ?

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.250
Braking drift.
 I want to learn the timing.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.120
Okay.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.020
H...hey, we're going for it already ?

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.800
<c.white>This feels way too fast !</c>

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.130
It sounds pretty good, whoever is driving.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.840
Well, I'd better get going.
 I have to check the updated suspension.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.860
R...ready.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:13.320
<c.white>Incredible. Just like Itsuki said, 
whether it's the Eight-Five or the Silvia...</c>

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.650
<c.white>...he's fast, even when it's his first time.</c>

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.180
<c.white>He's incredibly fast.</c>

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.650
<c.white>But I feel safe for some reason.</c>

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.760
<c.white>So it's true. You don't feel scared
 when a skilled driver goes fast.</c>

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:31.000
It's a little different from my dad's car,
 but now I know how to drive this.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.160
I'm going to try drifting.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.000
You're going to ?! 
Then what were you doing back there ?!

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.200
<c.white>Here it comes !
His entry speed's just incredible !</c>

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.500
What the hell are you doing, Bunta ?!

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.940
I need a smoke.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.200
I...I...In the middle of drifting ?!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.900
<c.white>Oh, no !</c>

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.000
Oh well, good enough.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:33.700
Now, I'd better get serious.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.150
You really haven't changed since the old days !

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.200
Let me get out !

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.750
<c.white>Oh man, what a terrible night.</c>

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.280
<c.white>They say you don't feel fear 
when a skilled driver goes fast, but...</c>

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.130
<c.white>That's a total lie.</c>

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.040
<c.white>Bunta's super crazy when
 it comes to pursuing speed.</c>

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:23.240
<c.white>And even Bunta recognizes Takumi, so he must be...</c>

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.550
Akagi's White Comet ?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.100
People call Takahashi Ryosuke that ?

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.730
Yeah. It was about three years ago...

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.650
Akagi's level was already high.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:42.560
Then word spread quickly when a
super fast white FC3S showed up.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.290
That was the lone wolf Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.330
The "lone wolf" ?
 What about the Akagi Red Suns ?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.550
Takahashi Ryosuke formed the Red Suns later. 
The goal was to perfect driving technique.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.750
They participate in gymkhana and circuit runs.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.690
The team's fundamentally different 
from the usual groups of friends.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.220
That's why their level is so high.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:16.950
Together with his brother Keisuke, they're now known as the Takahashi Brothers, but to me...

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:20.300
...Akagi's White Comet sounds right.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.100
Takahashi Ryosuke's charisma is unmatched in Gunma.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.750
Akagi's White Comet, huh ?
 Sounds awesome.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.100
This Saturday's battle is getting more interesting.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.500
Right, Takumi ?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.460
Isn't it ?

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.400
Huh ?

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.650
Where is that low tension coming from ?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.360
You said you were excited the other day !

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.400
Are you going to be alright ?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.900
I heard this at the shop.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.880
Is it true that Ryosuke turned down
an offer from a professional team ?

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.000
Yeah, it's true.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.700
I see.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.700
Is it because it's hard to strike a
 balance with his med school studies ?

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:22.150
That'd be a piece of cake for my brother.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.650
Then why ?

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:30.250
RS Giga is an elite team with stellar 
achievements in production car racing at Fuji.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:35.050
Becoming a pro driver, stepping into 
the spotlight, and getting recognized...

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.020
That's the success story 
every street racer dreams of.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.950
Kenta, Ryosuke's not interested
 in the world of the pros.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.650
Then why is he so into
 gymkhanas and circuit runs ?

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.150
What's the reason ?

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.000
The public street...

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.650
Process is what matters to my brother...

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.480
...in order to be the best on the public street.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.450
Welcome home, Brother !
 Is your FC ready ?

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.300
Yeah. I'm going to take
 it for a spin on Mt. Akagi.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.400
Are you coming ?

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.810
I'll be right there !

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.600
So, how much power did you add ?

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.600
Don't be surprised, Keisuke.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.400
It's got 260 hp at the maximum.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.800
You dropped it from 340 hp ?!

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.500
 What's the point of slowing the car down ?

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.580
 You must've learned the lesson
 the hard way after you raced him.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.000
Total balance is the key to
 mastering the downhill, not power.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:12.550
Sometimes you have to lower the power to go faster, which makes street racing complex.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.350
So Akina's Eight-Six is a formidable opponent ?

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.200
You could say that.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:29.100
I was confident I could manage big power on the downhill, so this de-tune is humiliating.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.840
I have to put my pride aside in order to win.

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:58.250
Incredible. The exit speed at 
the corners is definitely faster.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.700
There's another reason 
why I dropped the FC's power.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.930
If I just out-power the Eight-Six on
 the straightaways, that's not a victory.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.000
That won't satisfy me.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.400
Technique against technique.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.370
Drift against drift. That's my way.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.800
I'm happy to have met a driver
 who makes me feel this way.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:31.040
I feel like I've changed back to Akagi's White Comet, instead of Takahashi Ryosuke of the Red Suns.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.520
Brother...

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.500
Takumi, aren't you happy to be with me ?

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:57.700
You look spaced out, 
like your mind's somewhere else.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.600
I do ? Sorry.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.320
Thinking about cars ?

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:15.490
The day after tomorrow, I'll race against a driver, who's very skilled, fast, and famous.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:22.340
Lately, I've been thinking about
 him a lot, and feeling uneasy.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.700
Maybe this is pressure.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.130
Is that it ?

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.540
Cars have to be fast ?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.160
If you don't like it, just ignore it.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.440
Just because someone challenged
 you doesn't mean you have to take it.

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:46.850
I don't hate it.
 I don't know if I can win, but...

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.100
...I have no intention of running away.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.060
That's so you, Takumi.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.770
Deep down, you're really eager to race, right ?

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:06.050
You look modest,
 but you're a very competitive type.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.600
I've known all along.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.650
I wasn't the soccer club's 
manager for no reason.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.000
Wanna head home ?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.800
Just a little longer, let's talk 
just a little bit longer in the car.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.160
Okay.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.300
I know one more thing.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:49.800
I know why you punched an older student in the soccer club's locker room.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:56.820
A junior student told me what really 
happened long after you quit the club.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.300
Natsuki's body's just gorgeous.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.300
I can't get enough of this.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.600
Hey, I'll have dirty thoughts every
 time I see Mogi's face from now on.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.800
Don't be so envious.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.820
The other day...

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.450
Cut your dirty talk.

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.550
It gets on my nerves !

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.000
What's wrong, Fujiwara ?!
 I'm dating Natsuki !

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.600
I'll say whatever I want !

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.700
Besides, how can you talk 
to senior students like that ?

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.600
Like I care ?!

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:40.200
You got angry for my sake.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.770
Sorry, I misunderstood you for a long time.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.900
It's okay. It doesn't matter now.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.640
See ?
 Something's wrong with Takumi.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.640
 I'm sure of it.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.780
Now that you mentioned it...

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:54.410
But Takumi's always spaced out.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:26:00.850
He's even worse lately. 
Almost completely out of it.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.720
At first, I thought he was concerned
 about tomorrow's battle, but...

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.900
It's not ? Then what is it ?

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.800
Remember what Kenji said earlier ?

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:19.000
You mean about how Kenji's friend
 saw a panda Trueno with a girl inside ?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.610
Hey, why can't Takumi have a girlfriend ?

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.250
Stop. I know what's going on.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.880
He must be lost in love.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.650
He is ?!

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.290
Welcome.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.530
High octane, right ?

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.940
Yup. Fill it up.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.130
Right away.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.200
No need to clean the glass.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.440
Okay. Thanks.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.180
Hey, being love sick the day 
before a battle is pretty bad.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.000
What should we do, Iketani ?

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.000
I want romance. A passionate one.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.800
This isn't the time for that.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.980
I'll take care of this...

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.600
...while being completely free from personal envy like
 "How come he's the only lucky one ?!"

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.500
So, what's this about ?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.100
You've been seeing a girl lately, 
without telling me, haven't you ?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.180
I didn't mean to keep it a secret from you.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.180
But I don't have to report to you, do I ?

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.450
No excuses. 
Just answer my questions.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.990
So, how far have you gone ? 
Be honest.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.560
How far...? 
Up to Akina Lake.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:49.450
You moron, that's not what I meant !

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.250
Hey, watch out !
 Itsuki, watch where you're going !

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.800
You must have kissed her already, I suppose.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.180
I did.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.550
What the hell...?!

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.200
Stop that ! I mean it !

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.000
Takumi, you've been acting
 weird for the last few days.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.650
I've been thinking about something for a while.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.140
I know. It's not about
 tomorrow's battle, is it ?

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:27.100
You're right. I've been thinking
 about what comes after that.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.500
After that ?

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:36.360
How dare you say that to someone like me who 
hasn't had a girlfriend for 18 years and counting !

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.650
There's only one thing after a kiss.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.440
 A hotel, right ? A hotel !

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.340
What are you talking about ?

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.760
I'm talking about what will 
happen after tomorrow's battle.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:56.440
I don't have any concrete vision, 
so it keeps bugging me.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.600
Huh ? What're you talking about ?

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.480
Don't you see what I mean ?

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.100
No, I don't. You think there has
 to be something after the battle ?

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.550
You don't need anything. 
You're already fast enough.

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:14.800
No, I'm not.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.000
You are.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.550
Seriously, Takumi, please stop thinking
 about the small stuff and focus on the battle.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.690
By this time tomorrow, 
you and Takahashi Ryosuke...

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.750
A car's climbing up.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.040
Not one, but two cars.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.000
That's Takahashi Keisuke's FD.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.800
And that black GT-R must be 
Nakazato Takeshi of the Night Kids.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:04.850
Why are they racing on Akina ?

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.400
That surprised me !

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:12.920
They looked so amazing from the outside. 
Those cars are going very fast.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.700
What're you talking about ? 
You look much cooler on the downhill.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.000
Have you forgotten ?

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.200
You beat those two.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.040
My victory was under a specific condition...

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:34.300
...but those guys are fast wherever they go.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:14.100
I'm so curious about that Eight-Six.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.760
It makes me come to Mt. Akina, 
hoping that I can meet it again.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.000
Nakazato...

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.350
Our team has a downhill specialist named Shingo.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.800
He has a terrible personality, but great skills.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:37.320
He was defeated by Akina's Eight-Six recently, 
but he happily praises the Eight-Six driver's skills.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.720
He hardly ever compliments
 anyone because he's so full of himself.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.530
That Eight-Six has a charm like that.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:53.260
Once you race him and see his drift before your eyes,
 you'll be mesmerized by his splendid maneuvers.

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.500
I don't want him to be 
defeated by anyone but me.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.240
No matter who his opponent is.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.800
The Eight-Six is totally exposed.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.600
My brother has already completed 
his simulation for victory in his head.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.570
I can't think of him losing.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.920
<c.white>Both of them are in a class of their own, 
but when they race, one of them will lose.</c>

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:33.460
<c.white>I don't want to see 
their battle for some reason.</c>

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.450
You know boys...

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.300
They like cars.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.150
Are they that interesting ?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.970
Sure they are. 
You can go anywhere you like.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:56.610
Is that all ?

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.250
There's more to it.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.200
Any licensed driver can drive a car, but...

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:07.930
...only a handful can truly master driving.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.400
I've been thinking a lot about things like that...

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.100
...wondering what I should 
do to become a faster driver.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.340
I feel good thinking about things like that.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.220
Takumi, you're a pervert.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.860
Where did that come from ?!

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.650
I see. I finally figured it out.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:36.000
I've been wondering why, but...

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.600
I know the secret of your pheromones.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.300
You're answering your own question !

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.010
I have no idea what you're talking about !

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.420
Never mind. Never mind.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.580
Sheesh.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.300
Your race is tonight, isn't it ?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.050
Yup.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:04.810
I've seen an accident.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:13.640
You can lose, but don't crash no matter what.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.080
Promise ?

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.780
The moment of truth has come.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:07.650
Right.

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:12.090
Undefeated street racer
 Takahashi Ryosuke of the Akagi Red Suns...

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:17.300
...and Akina's dazzling new star, who drives the Eight-Six and defeated Takahashi Keisuke and Nakazato Takeshi.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.810
This match'll decide Gunma's fastest driver.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.770
Hey, Mako, don't you think the mood is stuffy ?

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.800
Is Akina always like this ?

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.800
I feel odd.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:48.800
Whoever wins, it'll be hard on us.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.700
Same here. Takahashi Ryosuke and 
Akina's Eight-Six driver aren't just fast.

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:58.250
They're charismatic drivers with mysterious appeal.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:03.850
I feel like something will 
change when the battle ends.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.740
I see...

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.850
Newbies like to watch from 
way up there, which is so typical.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.800
The battle won't be decided up there.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.800
This's the only spot where they can make a move.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.200
That's your prediction as well, Shingo ?

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.200
Just like you, I'd say.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.450
You too.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.350
Takumi isn't here yet.

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.800
I can't take this heavy mood.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.500
The gallery along the course is huge.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:20.340
Iketani, what brings so many people here ?

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.020
Well, it could be a yearning.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.080
A yearning...?

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.500
A yearning for the super technique demonstrated by Takahashi Ryosuke and Takumi.

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:38.660
Everyone gathered here likes cars so much.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.840
Here comes the panda Trueno !

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.370
That's Akina's downhill specialist, huh ?

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:04.660
Once you see his splendid drift,
 you'll dream about it !

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.000
Finally, the crowd's pumped up, Sayuki.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.120
He's good.

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.300
Keisuke, I've been thinking 
about this for a long time.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.800
When I lose in street racing, I'll retire.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.200
What's gotten in to you, all of a sudden ?

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.330
You can't lose.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:39.290
I'll leave the front lines, and pursue my project for 
the fastest team in the Kanto area in a different way.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.500
But what'll happen to the Red Suns if you quit ?

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.050
We have you.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:51.900
I'm...I'm no match for you, Brother.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.600
We need you when the stakes are high.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:04.930
Only two drivers have made 
me feel that I'll eventually lose.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.500
One of them is you, Keisuke.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.400
Me ?

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.530
And the other one...

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.600
Don't worry. 
I don't think I'll lose any time soon.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.900
Takumi !

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.100
Tonight, I'll drive at full throttle.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.750
It'll be fun.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.500
I'm going to count down !

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.300
In five...

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.500
Four...

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.360
Three...

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.550
Two...

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:36.640
One...

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.660
Go !

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.640
It's begun ! It's the best downhill battle 
in the history of Mt. Akina street racing !

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.850
The Eight-Six's fighting 
an equal battle with the FC !

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.150
Go, Takumi !

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.750
<c.white>My brother's standard 
strategy in an important battle.</c>

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.760
<c.white>He deliberately lets his opponent take the lead, and then overtakes them.</c>

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.220
<c.white>He's defeated all his opponents that way.</c>

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.900
The Eight-Six is ahead.

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:27.350
What an incredible super twin drift.
 They almost touched.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:30.320
Both of them are showing
 their best from the beginning.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.640
Both of them are so incredible !

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.020
But Takahashi Ryosuke usually
 doesn't use drift that much.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:55.050
He must be trying to win in the field his opponent is best at for him to remain king of the street.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:02.700
<c.white>Amazing. The angle of his counter steer is smaller than half a month ago.</c>

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:06.300
<c.white>His tendency of taking a wide 
counter steer during the turn-in is gone.</c>

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.580
<c.white>He grew in such a short period of time.</c>

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.120
<c.white>But that won't change the result. I'll still win.</c>

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.000
<c.white>He's staying right behind me.</c>

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.650
Are you serious ?

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:13.000
They skidded all the way through
 this tricky downward complex curve.

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:17.700
But it must be tough for the Eight-Six driver to have his opponent right behind him.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:23.750
Right. The chaser has the advantage
 in both technique and mentality.

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.050
That's a street racer standard.

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:28.900
On top of that, 
his opponent is Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:31.720
The pressure must be enormous.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.150
<c.white>He's so good that he gives me chills.</c>

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.180
<c.white>Beginners are only fast on the straightaways.</c>

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.000
<c.white>Mid-level racers know the corners.</c>

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:53.800
<c.white>Top-level racers accel in the third point, 
which isn't a straightaway or curve.</c>

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.660
<c.white>The main theme of my fastest street racing theory is to perfect that third point.</c>

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:04.410
<c.white>I've found a near perfect 
sample in a place like this.</c>

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.700
<c.white>I can only keep up with him because
 I'm copying his line and rhythm.</c>

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.700
<c.white>But it'd be difficult for me to do the same alone.</c>

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.570
<c.white>He's frighteningly good.</c>

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.720
<c.white>It's no good, I can't shake him !</c>

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.850
What ?! Are you sure
 about your section time ?!

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.500
<c.colora9f4f5>I thought I messed up...</c>

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:35.000
...but they're eight seconds
 faster than our first match here.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.900
Eight seconds ?

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.700
Eight seconds faster than Keisuke's time ?

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.020
<c.white>What's happening to those two cars ?</c>

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.770
<c.white>I'm not done yet ! I still have <i>it </i>!</c>

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.370
<c.white>My gutter run didn't work.</c>

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.370
<c.white>He's not an opponent I can defeat after all.</c>

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.700
<c.white>I'm going to lose this battle. 
I hate it, but I'm going to lose.</c>

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.200
That's right.
 If they reach the goal at this pace...

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.130
<c.colora9f4f5>...they can shorten the 
course record by 12 seconds.</c>

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:32.200
Gimme a break. This is madness.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.000
This is too much.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.620
Yeah, I have a bad feeling.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.800
It's the ultimate all-out battle
 that only those two could pull off.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.770
Tonight's battle will become legendary for sure.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:50.720
<c.white>Takumi...</c>

00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.700
They're approaching the five consecutive hairpins.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.200
I'm looking forward to their hard braking match just before the first corner.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.220
The Eight-Six is ahead !

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.100
You won't be able to turn at that speed.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:23.020
Dammit ! Turn !

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:30.530
He was passed.
The FC took the lead.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:34.750
I can't believe this. 
The Eight-Six under-steered.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:39.540
So no street racer can escape 
Takahashi Ryosuke after all.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.900
<c.white>He's strange.</c>

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:47.000
<c.white>He's got incredible skills,
 but he's not used to racing.</c>

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
<c.white>He's unexpectedly fragile when pressured.</c>

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.010
<c.white>I wasn't going to show my card by 
staying behind him a little longer...</c>

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:57.050
<c.white>...but now that I'm ahead,
 I'll just pull away and settle this match.</c>

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:10.750
Better than I've heard. Their speed range is
 way higher than that of the average drift brats.

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:15.100
But it's over, right ? 
Takahashi Ryosuke's going to win this battle.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.650
You're right, since he's taken the lead.

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:21.880
But the Eight-Six's line is slightly better.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:24.160
The Eight-Six isn't done yet.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:38.120
<c.white>He's not pulling away. 
I thought I'd fall behind right away.</c>

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.200
<c.white>There's no difference in speed.</c>

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.770
<c.white>Then I should shorten the
 gap as much as possible.</c>

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:50.610
<c.white>Whether it's a meter or two, I must 
get closer to the RX-7 before me !</c>

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.720
<c.white>I'm closing in.
The gap's getting narrower.</c>

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.480
<c.white>I haven't lost. I am faster.</c>

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.800
<c.white>The front tires are losing grip.
They're overheating at this critical moment.</c>

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.340
<c.white>But my skills are solid even
 if the tires are a bit worn.</c>

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.890
I'll be the winner.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.360
Alright, go !

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.250
Finally.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:58.610
Judging from the squealing sound, the
 battle must be deadlocked as expected.

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:04.080
The goal is right ahead. This's the only point where they can make a risky final maneuver.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.450
This straightaway will give them 
enough speed for a braking contest.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:13.100
Akina's roads are mostly narrow, 
but only this corner has three lanes...

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.240
...which allows for flexible line taking.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:19.410
Ahead of that is a combined
 curve of two different radii.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:23.200
The one who takes the
 lead in this corner will win.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:26.840
Here they come !

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:31.610
Good ! The Eight-Six is right behind !

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.600
What're you going to do ?
 How are you going to attack ?

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.480
Outside ?

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.130
You can't overtake from the outside ! 
The shorter inside path is the best choice !

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.650
The FC's sliding ! He'll miss the
 clipping point and lose momentum !

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:06.620
The Eight-Six ?

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.180
He's got it !

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.450
This thrill. I can't get enough of this.

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:44.040
Yeah.

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:50.930
When their lines crossed during the four-wheel drift,
 I felt goose bumps all over my body.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:56.120
We were lucky to be able to see a real battle.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.160
<c.white> No word was spoken from either side.</c>

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.330
<c.white>Not from the one who was disappointed in Takahashi Ryosuke's defeat...</c>

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.560
<c.white>...nor the one who was
 overjoyed with Takumi's victory.</c>

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.650
<c.white>Everyone just stood there.</c>

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:30.450
<c.white>The only thing that was certain was that the miraculous battle on Akina ended with an unbeatable downhill course record.</c>

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:34.400
<c.white>And something else began.</c>

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.200
Something's bothering me. Can I ask ?

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:51.100
Why did you wait until I caught you ?

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:57.360
You're completely mistaken.
You increased your pace.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:04.460
Indeed, my car's front tires were worn, 
but I kept my loss of pace to a minimum.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.410
I have no excuse. 
We fought under the same conditions.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:14.250
You didn't abuse your tires.
 I admit my defeat.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:20.200
How did you attain such skills at your age ?

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.900
You keep amazing me.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.200
Everyone's overrating me.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:29.500
I'm just familiar with Akina because
 I've driven here so many times.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.300
I don't have any special technique.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.130
I...

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:38.500
I don't think I'm faster. Not at all.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:45.440
Did you stop me to tell me things like that ?

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:53.550
I've met so many people, but you're unique.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.690
You're a nice person. I like you.

00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.760
Fujiwara Takumi, right ?

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.700
Don't be satisfied with a small stage. 
Look out to a bigger world.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.240
<c.white>A bigger world...</c>

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:11.060
See you again.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:37.930
<c.white>A bigger world, huh ? 
That must be what's been bugging me.</c>

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.130
<c.white>I learned and developed my driving on Akina.</c>

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.100
<c.white>I only know Akina's mountain pass.</c>

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:49.900
<c.white>What kind of mountain passes are out there ?</c>

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.560
<c.white>What kind of drivers are there ? 
What and how do they drive ?</c>

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:13.700
Here.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.600
Takumi... 

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.600
Dad... 

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:26.000
What is it, Dad ?

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.560
What is it ? Say it.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.200
It's just...nothing important.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:34.380
Mine isn't either.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:37.000
I see.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:41.970
I'm off.

00:55:07.550 --> 00:55:08.550
Let's see...

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.540
That car...

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.000
Show me what you've got.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.250
Alright !

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:24.000
The route of no return is chosen.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.940
So just race through it. So drastic.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.840
Leave the endless darkness behind.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.860
Test yourself ? Then break free from ambiguity.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:39.900
Pick up pieces of luck and take up the challenge.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:45.050
Frustration runs wild. Yes, that's an invitation.

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:49.290
Once you dive in, you can't escape. Dead or alive.

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:54.420
Clash of rationale and emotion may leave you in the dark.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.140
Tear away from gravity now.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.330
Make the sound of caution ring in your heart.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.640
It's a race for speed or nothing.

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.840
When you stop hesitating...

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:17.760
...you'll hold the dream you've been chasing in your hand.

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:30.450
Frustration runs wild. Yes, that's an invitation.

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:34.700
Not later. Don't put it off. Now is the chance.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:40.550
There's something more credible than the street signal.

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:44.980
Once you dive in, you can't escape. Dead or alive.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:51.080
Clash of rationale and emotion may leave you in the dark.

00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:56.040
Tear away from gravity now.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.260
Make the sound of caution ring in your heart.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:04.400
It's a race for speed or nothing.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.660
When you stop hesitating...

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:13.640
...you'll hold the dream you've been chasing. Let's go.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:21.660
You'll realize the dream you've been chasing on your own.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:10.350
Me, in an expedition match ?

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:15.300
Unfortunately, I don't have much time left.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:17.800
I think I have only one year at most.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:22.600
Before then, I want to see the end of this game.

00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:24.600
Let me get to the point.

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:31.800
I want my expedition team to completely dominate the
 Kanto area, and I want you to join our team as a driver.

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:37.800
If we combine your gifted skills 
and my theory, we're unbeatable.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.750
Mountain passes in other prefectures ?

00:59:41.370 --> 00:59:46.060
Our goal's to become the fastest street 
racing legend. My Project D has begun.
