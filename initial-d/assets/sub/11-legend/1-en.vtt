AKINA LAKE

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.700
This time already ?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.890
I must have gotten carried away.
 I'd better head home.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.020
W...what was that ?!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.400
New Movie [Initial]

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:38.400
Central Anime

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.400
- Awakening -

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.970
<c.white>He's still on my tail, and I can't shake him.</c>

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.600
<c.white>Is this a bad dream or what ?</c>

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.470
<c.white>Even though this's my first time on this mountain pass, 
someone like me shouldn't be pushed like this.</c>

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.920
<c.white>This ain't funny, dammit !</c>

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400
<c.white>You can't do it !</c>

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.820
<c.white>There's a sharp left hander
 ahead of this slow left curve.</c>

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.230
<c.white>Your tail is sliding out because of the inertia.</c>

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.820
<c.white>You're going too fast, 
there's no margin for recovery.</c>

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.100
<c.white>What the...?!</c>

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.450
<c.white>An Eight-Six ?</c>

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.950
<c.white>Is that really an Eight-Six ?</c>

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.650
Are you alright ?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.450
You hurt ?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.260
Did I just see the ghost of a
dead Mt. Akina street racer ?

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.520
That was a frustratingly perfect super drift.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.340
What the hell was with that Eight-Six ?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.720
Seriously, Iketani's story sounded awesome.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.900
It gave me the chills.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.000
An Eight-Six owned an RX-7 on Akina.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.280
Even on the downhill, an Eight-Six beat a pure sports machine like the Seven.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.380
Hey, Takumi, are you listening ?

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.600
I am.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.190
So what's an Eight-Six ?

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.800
It's a car...a car.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.000
That's a weird name.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.500
Who makes it ? Mazda ?

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.260
You don't know what an Eight-Six is,
 even though you work at a gas station ?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.400
An Eight-Six is a Toyota, 
and it's more than a decade old.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.550
That doesn't sound all that good.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.580
Even Dad has an old Toyota for work.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.650
You can't compare it with that.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.480
The Eight-Six is special, even if it's old.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.700
I've decided.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.350
I'll look for a used Eight-Six, instead of a Silvia.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.000
Is the Eight-Six easier to buy ?

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.290
Nope.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.690
I thought so, especially with our pay.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.500
The best a high school student can 
make would be what, about 120,000 yen ? 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.010
You guys have a job ?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.700
What's wrong ? Is it that strange
 for me to strike up a conversation ?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.740
So, you make 120,000 yen a month ?

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.480
Yeah, for 8 hours a day, 6 days a week.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.850
What ? That long ?

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.610
You only get 120,000 for working so long ?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.990
That's normal, isn't it ?

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.650
Unless you have a different sense of money.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.000
Good luck. Why don't we go 
somewhere and have fun after finals, okay ?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.600
What's with her...?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.680
It's been a year since
 I last talked to Mogi Natsuki.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.100
I used to talk to her often when I was in the soccer club, because she was a manager.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.800
But one day, I got in wrong with her.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.600
What did you do ?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.740
I beat up a senior, who just
 happened to be her boyfriend.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.630
You beat up a senior in the soccer club ?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.500
I had a reason.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.150
You've been like that since you were little.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.150
You normally look like a sleepyhead,
 but you change when you snap.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.200
You know those wimpy elementary school kids ?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.000
The type who gets really strong after crying ?

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.300
I was like that.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.200
So you're looking for an Eight-Six, huh ?

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.200
You have good taste, Itsuki.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.900
Don't I ?
 You think so too, Iketani ?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.230
Your parents have a car, right ?
 Why don't you borrow it ?

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.000
It's no good.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.690
My dad's car is a diesel-powered
 FF with an auto tranny.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.290
Only FR cars are real cars.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.100
If it's got four wheels,
 and is drivable, it's a car.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.700
You don't get it, do you ?

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.720
The car has no value if you
 can't enjoy it on the mountain pass.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.650
You bring that up so often.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.720
What do you do in the mountain pass ?

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.000
Do what ?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 Isn't it obvious ?
Drive hard in the corners.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.830
Is it fun doing that ?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.650
Wha...?

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.050
Of course it's fun !

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.840
Guys love to push it hard
 on mountain passes in style.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.200
Right, Iketani ?

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.450
Yeah, I like it.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.000
That's why I have a team.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.650
When I get an Eight-Six, 
can I join the Akina Speed Stars ?

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.650
I've been dreaming about that for so long.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.210
Welcome !

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.190
Welcome...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.210
An RX-7.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.650
Red Suns...?!

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.350
Could it be...

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The yellow FD of the Red Suns. 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.800
Rotary Brothers !

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.000
I knew it. 
That's Takahashi Keisuke.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.650
Is he famous ?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.450
Yeah.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:19.400
He's number 2 of the Akagi Red Suns,
 which is even recognized by some pros.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.920
He's Keisuke, the younger one of the Takahashi brothers, 
who are the fastest on Akagi with their rotary-powered cars.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.920
So we meet again.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.050
So it's your S13, after all.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.210
High octane, right ?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:36.000
Yeah.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.560
Fill it up with the high octane !

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.640
Yes, right.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.770
<c.white>Oh man, does he want to fly ?</c>

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.300
I have to ask you one more time.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.000
 You really don't know anything
 about that Eight-Six I saw on Akina ?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.050
No.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.050
<c.white>What ? So an Eight-Six really
 did beat Takahashi Keisuke ?</c>

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.920
How come the locals don't
 know about a car like that ?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.900
No matter how many times
 you ask, I just don't know.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.920
I see.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.610
Cap is okay.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.150
Anything else today ? 

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:22.630
I'll repay my debt to the ghost.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That Takahashi Keisuke is intimidating.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.900
What ?!

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.550
You're going to take me to Mt. Akina ?

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.520
Yeah, next Saturday.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.650
Alright !

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.700
I'll go.
 I'll go, no matter what.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.090
You, too. Right, right ?

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.000
Y...yeah.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.820
A chance like this doesn't come often.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.700
I'll be able to meet the 
members of the Akina Speed Stars.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.690
I can't wait for Saturday.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.780
I'm home.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.230
Supper ?

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.000
Already ate.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.000
You're so unsociable.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.500
Look who's talking.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.070
<c.color8ffeff>Good luck. Why don't we go 
somewhere and have fun after finals, okay ?</c>

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.850
<c.white>What's gotten into her ?</c>

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.000
Oh, whatever.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.920
I've got to wake up early.
I should get some sleep.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.650
Alright, the next left curve is...

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:11.560
<c.white>That bastard must be local because he
 seemed so familiar with Akina's mountain pass.</c>

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.930
<c.white>Otherwise, how could 
I have lost to an Eight-Six ?</c>

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.890
<c.white>I want to meet him again.
 I can't be satisfied until I get my revenge.</c>

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.700
<c.white>Come out, ghost of Akina !</c>

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.070
<c.white>I've come here to meet you !</c>

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.090
It's no joke, seriously.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.200
That outsider every night...

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.650
Akina is the home ground
 our team, the Speed Stars !

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.650
We're not Takahashi Keisuke's target.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.430
A panda-colored Eight-Six, right ?

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:08.580
Don't get me wrong, but I can't believe your
 story about such a super-fast Eight-Six on Akina.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.680
There is one !

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.300
Oh, Mr. Tachibana...

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.230
Hello. 

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.900
When I was actively street racing, there was the fastest driver, whose speed on Akina was recognized by everyone.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.000
Our team also claims 
to be the fastest on Akina.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.300
There are lots of self-proclaimed "fastest," 
but this guy was the real deal.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.650
On top of that, he still
 drives on Akina even today.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.150
Even today ?

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.500
We know most of Akina's street racers, so...

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.960
He drives at odd times because
 he's a tofu shop owner now.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.900
What ?!

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.000
A legendary street racer has
 become a tofu shopkeeper ?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:52.250
He delivers tofu from the mountain base to a hotel at Akina Lake around 4 am...

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.390
...with his Eight-Six.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:00.450
It's his job, so he drives every day, 
in the rain or even snow.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.900
He knows everything about Akina's 
mountain pass, even all the stains on the asphalt.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.200
Once he's unloaded the tofu, he drives down the pass at an incredible speed.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.250
I'd bet you 10,000,000 yen.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.200
The fastest on Akina is the
 tofu shopkeeper's Eight-Six.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:19.400
Tofu shopkeeper's Eight-Six...

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.820
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.660
Oh, Yuichi. 
What's the matter ?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.360
Nothing really. I was just curious 
about how you've been doing.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.000
<c.color8ffeff>Same ol', same ol'.</c>

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.800
I see.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.700
I've heard your Eight-Six is still kicking.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.400
<c.color8ffeff>A kid at my station said
 he saw you on the mountain.</c>

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:53.850
<c.color8ffeff>It sounded like you toyed around with 
an RX-7, but aren't you too old for that ?</c>

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.900
You're mistaken. That wasn't me.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.700
<c.color8ffeff>How could I be ? Only you drive an 
Eight-Six on Mt. Akina in the morning.</c>

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.350
That's certainly my car, but I'm
 not the one who delivers tofu now.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.580
What did you say ?

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.720
Don't spill it, or the tofu will be squished.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.840
I know, like I've heard that million times.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.400
I'm off.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.250
Let's see...

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.400
Man, I'm so excited.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.980
Why isn't it Saturday already ?
 My heart is pounding.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.250
Is that so ?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.550
You look as sleepy as usual.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.650
Leave me alone.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.340
Actually, I am sleepy.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.880
Don't forget about this Saturday, Takumi.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.590
I got it. You're so persistent.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:04.200
Lucky.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.100
Takumi, good morning.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.050
Mogi...

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.650
Good timing.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.890
Do you have a minute ?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.310
S...sure.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.580
Come with me.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.820
I'd better go.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.550
What's going on ?
 I thought Mogi hated you.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.900
I've been thinking...

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:39.260
I think it's time to restore our friendship.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.900
There's nothing to restore.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.880
I wasn't at odds with you.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.050
So you're okay with it ?

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.080
I'm so glad.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.050
You were talking about 
cars the other day, right ?

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.640
Can you drive ?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.300
Yeah.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.550
Then would you go for a drive with 
me sometime during summer break ?

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.350
I'll fix some lunch. It'll definitely be fun.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.050
Fine by me, but the
 car is a piece of junk.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.620
It's just a clunker for work.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.650
It's alright.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.350
I don't mind what kind of car it is.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.300
Let's go somewhere far away.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
The beach would be nice.
The two of us can go swimming.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.020
The two of us...?

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.810
Yup.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:45.010
<c.white>I wonder why she looks so sexy...</c>

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.600
The first right counter steer wasn't a mistake.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.250
It was a feint motion for the next move.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.600
Takahashi

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:07.880
If you steer from inside to outside in that state, the body will instantly roll to the outside...

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.760
...which induces over steering to enter a drift.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.050
I see. That makes sense.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:19.600
It's not a drift for show, but for driving fast.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.000
That Eight-Six might become useful for the research paper I'm currently working on.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.350
Who the hell is the driver ?

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.450
None of the Red Suns members
 can pull that off, except for you.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.300
What are you talking about ? 
You do that, too.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.500
Wha...me ?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.400
You're weird.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.650
You can go neck and neck 
with me without really thinking.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.390
It would be ideal if you could
 add my logic to your driving.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.970
Your analytical skills are extraordinary.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.900
 Regenerative Medicine

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.900
 Power to Revolutionize Medical Science

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:54.000
Just by following your opponent in a
 pair of left and right handers in a battle...

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.450
...you can figure out your opponent's habits, weaknesses, 
the car's suspension settings and even the engine power...

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.000
You're a fiend of some sort.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.600
Screw this.
 I don't understand this at all.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.040
That's fine.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.250
I'll go to Akina next Saturday.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.700
Finally, you're going to race ?

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.000
That's why I sent you to Akina....

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.700
...to make the Akagi Red Suns, and the names of Takahashi Ryosuke and Keisuke become legend.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.250
Let's start a project to become
 the fastest in the Kanto Plain.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.020
Quiet, Takumi !
 You're distracting Iketani !

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.600
But it's so scary.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.200
That doesn't come as any surprise.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.000
Anyone would be scared to ride in 
the car of a street racer for the first time.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.450
The next will be a hairpin 
curve in the second gear.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.700
Please, stop !

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.650
I said, shut up !

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.070
Sorry. I guess I got too 
excited and pushed too hard.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:13.900
You're so pathetic, Takumi.
 Man up, already, you wimp.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.500
You must be one of those who cries
 out on a roller coaster, aren't you ?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.500
I've never thought a roller coaster was scary.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:27.600
You won't understand this sense
 of fear even if I try to explain.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.800
What're you talking about ?

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.600
There.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.820
See all the guys gathered up ahead ?

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.600
Something's wrong.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.300
Iketani.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.810
What's wrong, guys ?

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.630
Hey.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.400
We're using the course for a bit.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.970
My brother is with me today.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.900
I'm Takahashi Ryosuke. 
Sorry for barging in without notice.

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.090
Ryosuke, the older brother 
of the Takahashi Rotary Brothers.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.340
A pair of new and old RX-7s.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.040
So they're the real Takahashi brothers.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.440
So they're the Akagi Red Suns.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.690
What brought you to Akina ?

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.350
That's because...

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.700
Head of PR, your turn.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.400
Okay.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:35.630
We just discussed the possibility of having a joint event between the Akina Speed Stars and Akagi Red Suns right here next Saturday.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.600
Joint event ?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.300
Yes.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.700
We belong to each of our
 teams because we love to race.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:47.330
I think we can improve our skills through stimulating interactions with other teams every now and then.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.700
At first, we drive around all together.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.600
At the end, we select two representatives from
 each team for a time attack on the uphill and downhill.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.020
It's not about winning or losing,
but for friendship between teams.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.000
How does it sound ?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.010
We don't have any reason to refuse, so...

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.400
Then, it's decided.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.000
Let us practice as much as we can today.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.220
We'll follow proper street racing manners.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.380
Iketani...

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.200
Yeah, their formality is all fake. 
That was an outright challenge.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.500
No need to chicken out. Let's go.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.070
They'd better not underestimate the locals !

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.760
Let's kick their ass !

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.090
Iketani, can we go, too ?

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.990
Sorry, but I can't let anyone 
ride along when I drive seriously.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.000
Wait here.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.000
Man, I wanted to go...

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.670
What...? 
They're already that far ahead ?

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.510
I'm doing my best, 
and still can't keep up !

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.100
This is just too sad.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.400
Why are we the only ones who 
don't have a car at a time like this ?!

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.200
Hey, Itsuki...

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.140
...is this fun ?

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.780
Street racers are strange.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.700
Why do they go nuts
 over something like this ?

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.640
Takumi, don't you feel anything ?!

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.250
Cars zooming by one after another !

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.860
The exhaust note, the squealing sound...

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.620
The smell of burning rubber...

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.650
Don't you get excited
 by seeing this in person ?

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.300
My tension is so high.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.900
<c.white>Get excited...?</c>

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.190
<c.white>Akina is full of losers.</c>

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.000
Going that fast ?!

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.450
Iketani...

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.770
If they can do it, so can I.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.120
<c.white>Downhill driving is tough...really tough.</c>

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.620
<c.white>Akina's familiar corners are
 showing their vicious side.</c>

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.700
<c.white>I couldn't even see the tails of the Akagi guys 
even though I pushed myself to such a scary level...</c>

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.740
<c.white>Is this all the technique I've got ?</c>

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.170
I feel hopeless after seeing that.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.890
I can't catch them no matter how hard I try.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.300
They're fundamentally different.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.050
We're getting pounded on our home ground.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.230
Are the Red Suns that good ?

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.660
Iketani.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.340
He hasn't quit yet ?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.390
Is he alright ?

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.040
He was pushing really hard earlier.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.190
<c.white>Akina is our mountain.</c>

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.000
<c.white>I'll show you the pride of the locals.</c>

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.040
What was that ?

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.990
Someone crashed !

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.400
I see.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.150
He was lucky his injuries weren't serious.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.500
Right.

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.000
Tell Iketani that we can
 postpone the Saturday event.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:27.350
But even if he's still up for it, you guys can't defeat me
 unless you bring your secret weapon, the Eight-Six.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.810
I'll drive the downhill on the event day.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:35.920
I was caught off guard the other day because I wasn't mentally prepared, and not familiar with the course.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.210
I won't lose to the same opponent.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.040
Got it.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.090
This is it.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.270
Howdy.

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:03.600
I've finally found the Eight-Six driver, Akina's very best.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:14.350
Come to think of it, Akagi had plenty 
of skilled street racers back in the old days.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:18.890
But I'm not the one who
 beat the Akagi driver's pants off.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.410
That can't be. There's no other person
 who delivers tofu with an Eight-Six.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:28.000
Even if it was me,
 I wouldn't race as a helper.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.020
An old man like me 
should know his place, right ?

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.750
It's an issue the younger
 folks have to solve themselves.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:51.200
I'm a street racer who grew up on Akina, 
so I can clearly see the Akagi guys are mocking us.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.970
That frustrates me most.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.590
I want to show them Akina has skilled drivers.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.920
You can do it, since you beat
 Takahashi Keisuke once before.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.010
Here, your fried tofu. 140 yen.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.770
Go home.
 Sorry that I can't be of any help.

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.080
I won't give up, Mr. Fujiwara. 
I'll come back tomorrow.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.950
Oh well, it wasn't me, really.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.490
I can't hate a guy like him.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:54.870
The thing is, I have 
something I must tell you, Takumi.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.300
What is it ?

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:00.890
I...

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.600
I bought a new bathing suit.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.570
It's super pretty.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.840
What ?
 That's all you wanted to say ?

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.200
Right on !

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.250
Good grief. I had to brace 
myself for what you might say.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:24.660
But I'm so happy
 that I had to tell someone.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:30.130
Do you wanna see it ? 
What color do you think it is ?

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.600
You wanna see sooner ?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.550
Honestly...yes.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.610
You can see it all you want,
 once we get to the beach.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.350
Save the fun until then.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:47.270
 What about next Sunday ? 
Are you free ?

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.050
Next Sunday ?

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.550
Fine. I don't have to work that day.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.580
Okay, that's it then.
 It's a promise, okay ?

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:01.850
You must not break it, because I hate
 smokers and people who break promises.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.690
What're you going to do if it rains ?

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.070
We'll just improvise. 
So, it's next Sunday, okay ?

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:20.590
<c.white>I'm becoming more and 
more interested in Mogi lately.</c>

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.650
Street racers hate to lose 
because of their strong pride.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.850
Actually, we have nothing else we're good at.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:36.860
So, losing on a familiar 
course humiliates us the most.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:43.200
The locals mustn't lose to outsiders.
That's the street racer's code.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.680
I'll come back. 
Your fried tofu tastes good.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.040
<c.white>Because of my poor skills, 
you have to bear this pain.</c>

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.570
<c.white>Sorry, Silvia. Forgive me.</c>

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.200
<c.white>I hope you get repaired 
and come back to me soon.</c>

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.260
<c.white>We can race together again.</c>

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.870
Yuichi, because you filled them full
 of bullshit, I get a visitor every day.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:37.600
That young Iketani guy with his
 arm in a cast limps back and forth.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.000
He's so pitiful.
 I can't stand watching him.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.460
Iketani is a nice guy.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.460
If you feel pity,
why don't you race for him ?

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.150
No thanks. Adults shouldn't 
meddle in fights between kids.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.800
That's my policy.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.400
You're still childish inside.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.430
Shut up.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:59.200
Well then, why don't you 
send a kid to a kids' fight ?

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.710
Are you talking about Takumi ?

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.150
Right.
 He's pretty good, isn't he ?

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.000
On the downhill, yeah.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.200
But not as good as me, though...

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.400
You get competitive so easily.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:18.440
I don't know how he got it, 
but he has a stubborn side...

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:22.960
...so he wouldn't race even if I told him to.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.000
Hey...

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.320
Can I use the car next Sunday ?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.900
Sunday ?

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.770
No.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.900
Why not ?
The shop is closed on Sunday.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.820
I need it because I have a commerce meeting.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.000
Seriously ? 
I really need to use the car that day.

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.000
I'll be in trouble if I can't use it, 
even though it's just a clunker.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.550
Man, this isn't good.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.600
It's about a girl, isn't it ?

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.230
So what ? I'll use the
 car without asking, okay ?

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.590
You can't drive a car without the key.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.380
Maybe I should hang it around my neck.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.150
You dirty old...

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:13.160
Well, if you're that desperate,
 I may reconsider.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.000
But I have a condition.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:16.740
A condition ?

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:24.780
Tomorrow night, you take the car and beat a
 big mouth who claims to be the fastest on Akagi...

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.850
...on the downhill of Akina.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.370
 Why ?

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.250
Then I'll let you use the
 car with no strings attached...

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.920
...with a full tank of gas to boot.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.400
Full tank of gas...

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.070
<c.white>Damn, that condition is so tempting.</c>

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.980
What ? Are you sure ?

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.570
I may be able to go to Mt. Akina tonight.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.450
Thank...

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.470
Thank you, Mr. Fujiwara.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.730
Hey, don't die on me.

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.700
The time attack begins 
at 10 o'clock. I'll be waiting.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.750
I can't guarantee it yet.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:16.000
If my Eight-Six doesn't show
 up on time, please give up.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.070
You'll have to resolve the matter yourself.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.500
I trust you.
 I know you've decided to go.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.570
Our entire team will be waiting for you, Mr. Fujiwara.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.610
Thank you !

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:35.600
If Takumi whines, maybe I should race.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.860
So many cars are headed for Mt. Akina.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.150
Akina versus Akagi.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:54.370
Akagi's fastest RX-7 and the
 unnamed downhill specialist of Akina...

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.160
This battle can't be missed.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.000
And then, hungry cars 
come one after another.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.860
 I'd better leave the station open late.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:34.840
The Red Suns have already
 dispatched their course marshals.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.350
Besides...

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:40.990
Look at the size of the gallery. 
I've never seen so many on Akina.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.730
Iketani, can we really trust 
your story about the Eight-Six ?

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:48.260
Yeah, he will come.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:54.870
Takahashi Keisuke's FD3S is easily making 350HP.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.700
Even on the downhill,
an Eight-Six is no match...

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.340
Trust me.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.250
What if he doesn't come ?

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.200
Then...

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.400
Kenji, you race.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.390
What ?!

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.200
See the gallery ?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.550
For the sake of the team,
 push hard, like there's no tomorrow.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.200
N...no way, this can't be happening...

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.100
I'm not very confident.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.650
Keisuke ! 

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.000
So cool !

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.700
He's so cool !

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.900
It's about time. 
Let's start the event.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.370
The time attack begins at 10 o'clock. 
Let's drive freely until then.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:43.800
Right.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:47.710
The size of the gallery seems big.
 So let's have fun.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.330
Show time, huh ?

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.410
There they are.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.540
The Red Suns guys are pretty good at drifting.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.040
They don't miss the clipping point.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.330
That's...

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.200
...the sound of a rotary. 
They're coming.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.740
Takahashi, the Rotary Brothers.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.780
It's pointed to the left before the right hander.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.480
Takahashi Keisuke's FD is so dynamic.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.920
Next is Takahashi Ryosuke's FC.

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.150
No way ! He began a
 straight drift from so far away !

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.120
Can he reach here ?

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.010
He kept the drift all through the corner.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.430
How did he do that ?

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.110
Not yet ?

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.190
What an awesome parallel drift.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.000
They're in perfect sync.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:25.000
Their claim of "the fastest in Akagi" 
isn't a sham. Their skills are real.

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.990
The Eight-Six hasn't arrived yet.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:36.150
<c.white>Please come, Mr. Fujiwara.</c>

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.650
<c.white>What a waste. 
These are just for show.</c>

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.650
<c.white>My driving is different when I go for time.</c>

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:51.500
<c.white>Akina doesn't have any worthy opponents.</c>

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.280
<c.white>Come out, Eight-Six, so I can prove it.</c>

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.200
No cup of water today ?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.500
Why would you need it ? 
You're not carrying tofu.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.400
Just enjoy it, okay ?

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:19.080
Enjoyment is supposed to be fun, right ?
 But I'm not really into this.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.440
What ? You aren't confident ?

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.500
I don't mean that.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.500
Just drive as usual, and you won't lose.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:28.210
Is that right ?

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.900
I'm off.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:45.800
Mr. Fujiwara...

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.200
Brother, the Eight-Six hasn't come.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.000
I thought it would show up,
 but what a disappointment.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
This pisses me off.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.140
Did you finish checking 
for debris on the course ?

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.400
Okay.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.500
So, shall we begin ?

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.490
Sure. Alright.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.740
It's time for the time attack.

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.640
Kenji, I'm sorry.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.330
It's alright, Iketani.
 I'll show them the pride of the locals.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.800
<c.white>A guy like him is my opponent ? 
This is ridiculous.</c>

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.350
This is the finish line. 
Can you hold the start for a while ?

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.040
What's wrong ?

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:41.000
<c.color8ffeff>A regular car just entered the mountain.</c>

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.090
<c.color8ffeff>It must be a spectator coming late,
 because the car was just an Eight-Six.</c>

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.310
Hey, was it really an Eight-Six ?

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.300
<c.color8ffeff>Yeah, an Eight-Six Trueno.</c>

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:52.400
What color ?

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.500
<c.color8ffeff>A black and white panda colored.</c>

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.250
Mr. Fujiwara...

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.700
Finally, Brother, my target has come.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.900
My opponent isn't this One-eighty, is it ?

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.600
Yeah, you're right.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.370
That Eight-Six driver is pretty good.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:27.620
The way he cleared the corner
 left an indescribable impression.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.200
Did it ?

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.200
It looked just like any
 Eight-Six kid on any mountain pass.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.600
<c.white>Only the ones in the know can see it.</c>

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:44.000
<c.white>Street racers who can control their cars
 like their own limbs give off a strong aura.</c>

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.350
<c.white>That wasn't an ordinary street racer.</c>

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.100
<c.white> I never expected to see
 someone like him on Akina.</c>

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:09.630
He's come.

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.490
That's it. 
That's the one, Brother.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.870
Kept us waiting for this long.
 Some kind of star, huh ?

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:24.050
Here. 
Turn around right here.

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.400
So he really came.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.130
Yeah. He came to protect the 
pride of Akina's street racers.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.990
Over here. Stop, stop.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:48.290
Akina's legendary fastest driver, 
Fujiwara Bunta, has come for real.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.810
Takumi...

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.470
Iketani, what's going on ?

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.090
There were tons of people on the way up.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.410
I feel like I'm in the wrong place.

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:15.260
Takumi, what's the meaning of this ?

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.050
Meaning ?

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.750
Dad told me to come here, so I did.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.040
Your father ?

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:22.800
Fujiwara...

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.400
Fujiwara Takumi...

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.560
Takumi, you're the son of the
 tofu shopkeeper, Mr. Fujiwara ?

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.600
Yes, I am.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.920
But why you ?

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:39.130
Dad told me to beat 
the RX-7 on Akina's downhill.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.730
Takumi !

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.430
You moron !

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.160
Ouch...
 Why did you do that, Itsuki ?

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:51.140
Don't you get it ? 
What're you going to do with this mood ?

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:54.490
You said you'd come later 
if you felt like it. But this late ?

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:57.200
On top of that, with an Eight-Six ?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.550
Eight-Six ?

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.780
This isn't an Eight-Six. It says Trueno.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:04.270
A Trueno is Eight-Six.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:09.540
The type AE86 Trueno and Levin
 are collectively called the Eight-Six.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.810
Huh ? Seriously ?

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.460
Just move the car, already. 
You're interfering with the time attack.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.300
Wait, Itsuki.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.550
Takumi, let me ask you one thing.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:23.300
Sure.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:27.150
Who's been delivering tofu to Akina Lake ?

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.000
I am, these days.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.110
Finally, I got it.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.690
Thanks for coming, Takumi. I owe you.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.470
I'll leave the downhill attack to you.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.600
What are you talking about, Iketani ?

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.350
If an amateur like him takes on Akina's downhill, he'll crash and die in an instant.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:56.260
Don't worry. 
You can do it, right, Takumi ?

00:44:57.830 --> 00:44:59.340
You look young.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.240
What's your name ?

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.750
Fujiwara Takumi.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.950
I'll remember.

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.210
I'm Takahashi Keisuke.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:19.680
It's time for the downhill time attack between 
the Akina Speed Stars and the Akagi Red Suns.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.780
Ten seconds to start.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.810
Nine...

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:25.650
Eight...

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.760
Seven...

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.650
Six...

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:28.680
Five...

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.660
Four...

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:30.710
Three...

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:31.570
Two...

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.590
One...

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.510
Go !

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.870
Go, Takumi ! Step on it !

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:41.800
Good. Keisuke took the lead.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.920
<c.white>It's not my style to beat you on
 a straightaway, but this is a time attack.</c>

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.080
<c.white>I'll create a large margin
 before the entry into the first corner.</c>

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.710
<c.white>The FD is Japan's best cornering machine. 
It can dominate in the corners.</c>

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:01.210
Amazing ! 
That FD is incredibly fast !

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:04.400
After all, the Eight-Six is no match for it.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.020
Did you see what that Eight-Six just did ?

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.710
Yeah. It zoomed by without
 touching the curve or the guardrail.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.230
I've never seen anyone 
who can clear a corner so fast.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.700
Incredible !
What's with that Eight-Six ?

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.000
It's scary fast !

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.700
<c.white>It's gaining on me ?</c>

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.890
<c.white>No way. That's impossible.</c>

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:50.730
<c.white>Watching the start dash, 
its power is just about 150HP.</c>

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:54.280
<c.white>It's not the monster machine Keisuke described.</c>

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.120
<c.white>The shift point is quick because it's got a close-ratio transmission for rallying.</c>

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:05.500
<c.white>Even so, I can't think of any 
reason for Keisuke's FD to lose.</c>

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.550
<c.white>If it happens,
 what's monstrous isn't the car...</c>

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.650
<c.white>...it's the driver.</c>

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:22.690
It went by at incredible speed.

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:25.050
It could go off the course at any time.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:27.870
The driver doesn't have any fear of the downhill ?

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:31.300
Are you serious ?

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.900
Takumi's father is a legendary street racer ?

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.100
Yeah.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.450
But he's just a blunt tofu shopkeeper.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.470
I'm not mistaken.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.000
And he sent out Takumi, which means...

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.750
I still can't believe this because Takumi 
didn't even know what an Eight-Six was.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:04.350
He kept the tail out through the
 straightaway between the corners.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.890
What the hell ?
 It's not the type of drift we know.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.010
<c.white>It's art in its own right.</c>

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.330
<c.white>It's a full-throttle four-wheel drift
 with minimal counter steer.</c>

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:23.000
<c.white>He's controlling his Eight-Six at
 its limit as if it's a part of his body.</c>

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:29.300
<c.white>If the underpowered Eight-Six loses momentum,
 it takes time to pick up speed.</c>

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.110
<c.white>He doesn't do any wasteful braking, 
and takes the shortest path.</c>

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:35.210
<c.white>It's on my tail !</c>

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.040
What ? Keisuke is ?

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.200
<c.color8ffeff>Yeah, he's being tailgated.</c>

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.960
<c.color8ffeff>Akina's Eight-Six is extraordinary. 
It's so fast !</c>

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.900
It can't be. 
How can Keisuke be tailgated ?

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.950
Takumi caught up with the FD.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.150
Takumi did ? For real ?

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:56.710
I can't believe this.

00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:02.770
The rest of the course is steeper with fewer
 straightaways and more tight hairpins.

00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:04.700
Keisuke should be alright.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.000
<c.white>I miscalculated.
 I didn't expect him to be this good.</c>

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.710
<c.white>In mountain passes, the downhill
 is decisively harder to drive.</c>

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:19.820
<c.white>On the uphill, you can recover from an error,
 but any mistake on the downhill will lead to an accident.</c>

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:22.500
<c.white>And Akina's slope is particularly steep...</c>

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.340
<c.white>...so the fear is immeasurable.</c>

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.150
<c.white>The one who dominates on the downhill...</c>

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:32.860
<c.white>...the downhill specialist, 
is the fastest street racer.</c>

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.000
<c.white>What's going on ? 
Why am I being chased around like this ?</c>

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.800
<c.white>He leaves less room than before.</c>

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.610
<c.white>The second gear acceleration is almost 
equal, but I fall behind on the straightaway.</c>

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.600
Man, what an incredible braking drift !

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.980
He's tailgating Takahashi Keisuke !

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:10.250
How can an Eight-Six be that
 fast on this difficult Akina course ?

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.200
He's super cool !

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.500
<c.white>That shitty old man probably won't recognize
 my win unless I overtake my opponent.</c>

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.200
<c.white>I have no choice. I have to do it.</c>

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.550
<c.white>I'll make my move in the five hairpin curves.</c>

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:38.140
There they are.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:44.000
<c.white>Even if I pull away on the
 straightaway, he still catches me...</c>

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.800
<c.white>...which means his cornering work is better.</c>

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.840
<c.white>I can never accept that !</c>

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.260
<c.white>Getting pressured by an 
underpowered car in corners...</c>

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:56.500
<c.white>That's the most humiliating
 disgrace for a street racer !</c>

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.960
<c.white>Goddammit !</c>

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.620
The FD is ahead.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:03.820
Well, that's expected.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:05.740
What the...?

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.960
The Eight-Six isn't braking.

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.500
There's a right hairpin curve ahead !

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.380
Are his brakes out ?!

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:22.820
What the hell ?!

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.900
What just happened ?

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:35.710
I don't know. That Eight-Six 
couldn't have cleared the corner.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:43.620
<c.white>He let the tires grab the gutter 
and turned at an abnormal speed.</c>

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.890
<c.white>It's a simple idea, but not
 a trick anyone can pull off.</c>

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.000
<c.white>There're some over-the-top
 crazy drivers out there.</c>

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.430
<c.white>I've found some more fun.</c>

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.650
Here it comes.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:00.280
Which one ?

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.600
The Eight-Six...?

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.850
That air-headed Takumi won !

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:30.070
With seven seconds of advantage. 
This's way too cool.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.330
I felt myself going pale, and now
 I have goose bumps all over.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.310
Why are you crying, you idiot ?

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.150
I don't know, but I'm just so happy.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:46.530
We should ask Takumi all kinds of stuff,
 like drift control and line taking.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:47.240
Right.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.900
We should put a Speed Stars sticker 
on the Eight-Six before he notices.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.100
I'll be honored to do that.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.750
Really ? Okay, you do it.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:58.040
How could Keisuke lose ?

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:02.800
We assembled this gallery to promote 
the Red Suns, but it backfired, didn't it ?

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.400
We underestimated Akina.
 I didn't expect a street racer like him.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.630
The rumors will spread tomorrow.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.650
Yeah, we'll win on the uphill...

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:16.700
...but this event essentially
 ends with a Red Suns defeat.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.000
<c.white>I must admit, things like this
 do happen in mountain passes.</c>

00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:28.670
<c.white>That Eight-Six is interesting.</c>

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.300
I accept my defeat.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.150
You must keep winning.

00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:01.970
You can't lose to any street
 racers until I beat you. Got it ?

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.650
I have no reason to take orders from you.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:07.360
Besides, I'm not a street racer.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.100
Are you being sarcastic ?

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.990
You must have practiced really
 hard to achieve that level of skill.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.630
You wouldn't have done that, unless you like it.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:17.200
I don't drive because I like it.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.650
I have no choice because I have 
to help my father's business.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.650
I had to find something interesting
 to do because it's boring.

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:26.000
I also want to return home quickly, 
so I drive as fast as possible.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:30.900
So I never wanted to 
improve my driving skills.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.470
 You don't understand.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.200
Don't be ridiculous !

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.250
You're the one who doesn't get it !

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.400
You must like driving !

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.450
You should realize it after tonight.

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:49.000
If you like to drive a car, 
that's enough to be a street racer.

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.200
If you're a street racer, 
be proud of the skills you've got !

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.210
I like to drive a car...?

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.210
<c.white>That was strange.</c>

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:40.320
<c.white>The RX-7 in front of me
 was getting closer and closer.</c>

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.520
<c.white>Before I knew it I was enjoying the chase.</c>

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.470
I had enough fun swimming.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:52.110
The ocean is definitely 
better than the swimming pool.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.000
Did you have fun, Takumi ?

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.500
Yeah.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:57.920
It's nice that we came, right ?

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:05.810
Takumi, you're pretty good at driving.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:06.760
Am I ?

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.650
I tend to get motion sick.

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:15.030
 But your driving didn't make me feel sick.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.850
I like this car.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:22.550
It's little and cute.

00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:23.700
What's it called ?

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.550
Trueno.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:26.600
Trueno ?

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.920
Let me ride in your Trueno again.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.410
Sure.

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.260
Cute, she says. 
What're you gonna do ?

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:57.540
I heard Takumi was extraordinary.

00:56:57.540 --> 00:57:01.900
Iketani and the others were going
 on and on about it all morning.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.900
He's nothing special.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:07.840
The level of the kids these days must be low.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.900
I'm looking forward to his future.

00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.970
You might not be able to 
stay so confident much longer.

00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:19.200
That's impossible.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.610
Oh, really ?

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:29.560
Here ya go.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:34.800
Dad.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:41.860
When I drove this car, 
everyone seemed happy.

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:51.500
Maybe I didn't know I liked cars.

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.550
Is that right ?

00:57:55.120 --> 00:58:01.450
I might become a better driver 
than you in two or three years.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:03.400
You're ten years too early to say that.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.920
I'm off.

00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:10.860
Okay.

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.450
I'm counting on you today, too.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:19.250
 So often, many morning mists, I would drive...

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.600
 ...as I slice through the wind...

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:31.000
 ...with a bright hope for the future.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:50.100
 I felt like I could escape the quiet and dull scenery.

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:57.200
 Excitement in my heart grows stronger.

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:03.650
 Now your song of time becomes...

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:13.000
 ...more irresistible and everlasting, every morning.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:31.200
  You spoke of my true desire, which I was unaware of.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:39.400
 If it reaches the beyond, I'm not afraid.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:51.600
 Like when I hold you and wait for the dawn...

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:58.800
 ...I embrace it with that same warmth.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:05.600
  Excitement in my heart grows stronger.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:11.900
 Now I leave you and my past behind.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:21.600
 As my passion begins to race forward it's unstoppable.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.100
 Forever.

I want to drive like Takumi.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.410
That's a GT-R R32.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:41.250
I pay respect to the R badge, but I won't yield.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.180
