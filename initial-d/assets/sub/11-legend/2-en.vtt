00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.700
What the hell are they thinking ?! 
This straightaway's too short for that !

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.900
Hey, that's Takahashi Ryosuke's white FC !

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800
Are they battling ?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
An R32 GT-R.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.450
<c.white>He's better than I thought.</c>

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.360
<c.white>I can keep up with Takahashi Ryosuke.</c>

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.500
Young Magazine 35th Anniversary Production

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.850
As I thought, you're Takahashi
 Ryosuke of the Akagi Red Suns.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.200
And you ?

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.350
I'm Nakazato Takeshi of the Myogi Night Kids

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.200
Nakazato...

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.900
I've heard your name at least.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.760
So, what's a Myogi street racer doing in Akina ?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.700
Look who's talking. 
You're an Akagi street racer.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.300
Both of us have the same objective.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.000
I never expected someone like that in Akina.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.600
A driver of a GT-R tuned to 380 HP
 is planning to challenge Akina's Eight-Six ?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.900
How did you know the power of my car's engine ?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.610
The battle will be very one-sided, and the outcome is obvious before you even try.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.500
The GT-R will win hands down on 
the uphill, thanks to its power, but...

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000
...you can't beat that Eight-Six on the
 downhill, no matter how hard you try.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.100
Say what ?!

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.000
Don't get me wrong. 
I just spoke my mind.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.250
Don't screw around with me.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.400
If you put it that way, 
I can't back off no matter what.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.520
I'll beat that Eight-Six and
 make you eat your words.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.550
The R32 Skyline GT-R and I will
 humiliate Akina's downhill specialist !

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.240
You'll understand once you race against it.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.400

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.700
Don't spill it, or you'll squish the tofu.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.200
More than usual ?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.600
You have a big load today.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.390
I thought he had changed a bit, 
but maybe it's just my imagination.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.550
GENERAL

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.490
This way, please.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.890
Thank you so much.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.330
Takahashi Ryosuke was in Akina, huh ?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.650
He had super precise drift.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.930
But what surprised me more was the GT-R.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.460
The driver showed excellent grip,
 and stayed right on the FC's tail.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.400
I don't know who it was, but he's amazing.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.920
Well, drifting is flashy, but some say
 it's slower than driving with grip.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.530
Is that so, Iketani ?

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.900
But real drifting is fast, and Takumi proved it.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.600
Did you think about it, Takumi ?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.400
Well...

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.450
I beg you. I got carried away, and said your 
Eight-Six was the Akina Speed Stars' secret weapon.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.010
I already blew my horn.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.790
Same here.
 We'll be embarrassed if you don't join.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.160
You have to join, Takumi. 
I'm a part of the deal.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.800
I don't mind joining your team, 
but it's for street racers, right ?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.200
But I'm not a street racer, so...

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.680
What the hell are you talking about ?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.100
Nobody drives faster than you in Akina.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.460
Is that so...?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.700
It is. If you're not a 
street racer, what are you ?!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.100
<c.white>A cup of water is a nice idea.</c>

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:25.120
<c.white>I thought Takumi's superb driving was because of his
 experience in driving Akina's downhill for so long, but...</c>

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.650
<c.white>...I was wrong.</c>

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.050
<c.white>The uphill drive was more important.</c>

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.200
<c.white>The load shift is one of the basics of controlling a car.</c>

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.800
<c.white>If you try not to spill water in a cup,
 you'll learn extremely sensitive load shifting.</c>

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800
<c.white>You're amazing, Bunta.</c>

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.800
<c.white>You've trained him into a 
completely new type of driver. </c>

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.920
 Thank you.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.700
<c.white>That was quite a circus.</c>

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.850
<c.white>I hate drifters...</c>

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.040
<c.white>...but that Eight-Six was fast.</c>

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.570
<c.white>I need a neck and neck battle 
where I can lose myself completely.</c>

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.300
<c.white>You'll be a worthy opponent...</c>

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.950
<c.white>...Akina's Eight-Six.</c>

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.390
So hot...

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:39.300
I wish I could take deliveries in an
 air-conditioned car, like Iketani and Takumi.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.800
I just don't understand Takumi.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.250
He totally owned Takahashi 
Keisuke of the Akagi Red Suns.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.210
But he hasn't changed a bit, and doesn't
 even think of himself as a street racer.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.290
I'd be so hyped up, telling everyone
 in school how I did this and...

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Welcome.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.570
A GT-R ! How awesome !

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.700
I'm Nakazato of the Myogi Night Kids.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.800
I was told by the locals that I could 
contact the Akina Speed Stars here.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.000
You're a member, aren't you ?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.690
Huh ?

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.380
Can you tell me when I should visit 
Akina to see that famous Eight-Six ?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.900
<c.white>A Speed Stars member...</c>

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.060
<c.white>That sounds so cool.</c>

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.650
Hey, do you know what I'm talking about ?

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.490
Maybe this's the wrong gas station.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.750
No, you got the right station.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.620
In fact, the Eight-Six driver
 is a close friend of mine.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:51.680
Really ?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.390
He and I are the fastest 
Eight-Six duo among the members.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.300
Is that right ?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.900
Many Eight-Six drivers are very skilled, 
and I hear good things about the Speed Stars.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.670
I'm so honored.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.700
Anyway, I can get a hold of him.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.250
He's my best friend after all.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.040
Thanks. 
Make sure you tell him...

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.150
...Nakazato of the Night Kids will be waiting on Mt. Akina at 10 pm next Saturday...

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.570
...for one downhill match.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.630
Wha...? 
W...wait ! Please...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.200
<c.white>Holy crap...</c>

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.100
<c.white>That was...</c>

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.700
...a declaration of challenge !

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.900
I'm sorry ! 
So sorry, really sorry !

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.000
I apologize !

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.750
What a pain.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.200
It must be the black GT-R we saw on Akina.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.700
It's gotta be.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:06.000
It makes sense. Nakazato of the Night Kids can stack up against Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.500
Takumi, I'm not in a place to be asking this,
 but will you accept his challenge ?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.150
Otherwise, I'll be a burden to them.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.600
I don't get it. Why would you be
 a burden to them if I don't go ?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.080
People'll speak bad about the 
Speed Stars for running away.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.200
Street racers...

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.370
When it comes to a car race, 
street racers must accept challenges !

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.430
<c.colora7feff>If you like to drive a car,
 that's enough to be a street racer !</c>

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:45.660
That may be true for street racers, 
but I'm not a street racer.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.730
Welcome.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.730
Hey, Takumi...

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:58.010
Iketani, what should we do ?
 We'll be in trouble if Takumi doesn't go.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:04.820
Well, the GT-R would be
 too tough, even for Takumi.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:12.430
Besides, Nakazato of Myogi is a famous street racer just like Akagi's Takahashi brothers.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.330
Given the circumstances,
 I can't force him into this.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.260
Dad, is the GT-R really that good ?

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.180
Yeah, it is.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.520
Could you beat it on the downhill ?

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.040
I could.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.000
It's a piece of cake, 
whether it's a GT-R or a Porsche.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.500
You think I can defeat it ?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.300
You want me to lend you my car ?

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.000
No, it's okay.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.870
I see.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.010
Thanks for the food.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.910
So a GT-R will be next, huh ?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.500
Nakazato's GT-R is here again today !

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.000
Its exit acceleration is incredible !
 How much horsepower does it have ?

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.360
It's going to race against the Speed Star's Eight-Six tomorrow, right ? That's all they're talking about.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.200
I smell trouble.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:17.200
The Night Kids' Nakazato is challenging the Eight-Six, which defeated the Red Suns' Takahashi Keisuke.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.630
It's going to be a clash of pride between
 the two large factions of Akagi and Myogi.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.110
Akina's nights are gonna
 be super exciting this summer.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.670
That Civic that just went by was really fast.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.200
<c.white>Sure, the GT-R is a monster, but it's not invincible.</c>

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.350
Itsuki, I've thought about it since then.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.600
I'm going to ask Takumi to race tonight.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.600
Even if his opponent is a GT-R, the Eight-Six 
becomes something else with Takumi behind the wheel.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.000
It turns into an amazing super machine.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.400
I don't think he'll listen.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.310
What ?

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:21.800
He's hated being forced or told
 what to do since he was little.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.500
He looks reserved, but he's really stubborn.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.180
He's that type.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400
I see.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.600
Iketani, I'll go to Mt. Akina tonight, 
and apologize to the GT-R driver.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.300
Itsuki...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.300
I'll explain the circumstances, 
and kneel down on the ground or whatever.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.950
From the beginning, the
 Speed Stars had nothing to do with this.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.600
Alright, we'll go too.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.000
Don't mention this to Takumi.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.280
He must have forgotten about it already.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.670
Speaking of which, where's Takumi ?

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.300
Oh, he's in the office.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.010
The Manager had something to discuss with him.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.590
Let me make this clear, Takumi.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
You shouldn't do this because
 the GT-R is a nasty opponent.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:15.900
You're only doing this
to save face for Itsuki, right?

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.650
If so, you shouldn't.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:24.900
You're clueless about cars, so you don't know how great the GT-R is, like a class of its own.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:32.810
It's got the combined advantage of FR and 4WD thanks to the electrically-controlled torque-split 4WD system.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.680
It's also fast on the downhill because of superb stability.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.240
The RB26 twin turbo engine is monstrous.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:48.500
It was originally designed to make 600 HP for racing,
 so you can easily obtain power with a minor modification. 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.020
The Eight-Six is totally outclassed.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.500
Besides, your opponent is a famous
 street racer. This race is really unfair.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.870
You made a name by defeating the
 Akagi Red Suns, so you'd better cherish it.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.530
You gain nothing by participating in
 a race you have no chance of winning.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.950
Listen to your elders, okay ?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.250
Thank you for your advice, but...

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
...I'm not really interested in being a 
famous street racer or anything like that.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.600
So you're not going to back down ?

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.790
I won't.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:41.500
If you hype it up like that, I want to
 find out how great that car really is.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.920
Manager, I'm not afraid of the GT-R.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.400
<c.white>He bought it.</c>

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.450
<c.white>I can't remember how many
 times I fooled Bunta this way.</c>

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.550
<c.white>They're so alike, right 
down to their personality.</c>

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.650
<c.white>This is going to be fun.</c>

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.800
Temporarily Closed 
for Personal Reasons
 -Fujiwara Tofu Shop

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.350
Temporarily closed, what the hell ?

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.600
I didn't know about this.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.070
We're poor, you can't be slacking off.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.010
Where is the car ?

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.140
Dad ?

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.900
I can't do anything without the car.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.510
Such a huge gallery.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.540
It looks bigger than the one during the race against Takahashi Keisuke the other day.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.000
I didn't expect this to become such a huge event.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.760
The black GT-R's Nakazato...

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.070
A huge group of the Night Kids members came.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:46.480
This isn't the atmosphere for admitting mistakes.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.900
The Takahashi brothers have come.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.290
Hurry up !
Keisuke is so cool !

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.760
Ryosuke, you're so gorgeous !

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.110
Takahashi Ryosuke and Keisuke have come, too ?

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.000
That makes it even harder to back off. 
What should we do ?

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.830
<c.white>Why am I so irritated ?
 I want to go so bad.</c>

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.490
<c.colora7feff>If you like to drive a car,
 that's enough to be a street racer !</c>

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.760
<c.colora7feff>If you're a street racer, 
be proud of the skills you've got !</c>

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.900
<c.white>I don't know if I like to drive or not, but...</c>

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.950
<c.white>...I am proud of the skills I've learned by myself.</c>

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.730
<c.white>At least, I feel like that, and I want 
to test my skills to the limit.</c>

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:14.030
<c.white>I want to challenge the GT-R 
by throwing everything I've got at it.</c>

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.790
<c.white>I've never felt this way.
 I'm getting eager to drive.</c>

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.850
<c.white>Dad, please come home.</c>

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.370
<c.white>That's...</c>

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:42.790
<c.white>That sound.</c>

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.060
I'm off, Dad !

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.140
His eyes looked different.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.400
The Takahashi brothers have come as expected.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.920
They must be concerned.
 I was assured I'd lose.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:20.610
This's a great opportunity for us to show the gallery that drifting can never be faster than gripping.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.060
Oh man. Here comes 
Takeshi's tunnel-minded opinion.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.000
Shut up. You know it's true.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.110
Drift is just a performance to please the gallery.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.500
It's meaningless to be a street 
 racer if you don't try to drive fast.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.140
I know it because I used to drift.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:45.700
Once you're done with drifting and start
 driving with grip, you'll know it's better.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.490
The time of the drifting FR is over.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.540
I'll put an end to Akina's Eight-Six.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.800
Itsuki, let's go.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.900
We'll be with you.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.200
I don't know what they're 
going to do to you, but...

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.200
<c.white>They'll kill me if I say the Eight-Six won't come.</c>

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.400
<c.white>Father, Mother...
 God help me, please.</c>

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.650
<c.white>I've never slept with a girl !</c>

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.390
<c.white>I don't wanna die !</c>

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.170
Why are you kneeling down
right in the middle of the road ?

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.350
Takumi...

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.680
Takumi, you came.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.060
Sorry I'm late, Itsuki.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.700
When it comes to a car race, 
street racers must accept challenges, right ?

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.850
Takumi !

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.230
There he is, Takeshi.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:18.420
So pretentious, showing up at the last moment.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.600
<c.white>I thought he'd be older.</c>

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.390
<c.white>How did a kid like him acquire such technique ?</c>

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.400
Your Eight-Six is gone.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.680
Yuichi ?!

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.430
Takumi went to Mt. Akina ?

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:49.190
Yeah, he took off looking really uptight.
 I don't know what's going on.

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.100
I never expected him to go
 to the mountain pass himself.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.300
Like father, like son, after all.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.250
Bunta, he'll be racing against a GT-R. 
Did you give him any advice ?

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.390
Nothing really.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.300
But...

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.660
But what ?

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.000
This is the goal. 
All marshals are in position.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.210
<c.colora7feff>Nobody's entered the mountain pass. 
We can start any time.</c>

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.900
Roger that. 
Let us know if someone else enters.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.500
<c.colora7feff>Got it.</c>

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.650
I'm Nakazato of the Myogi Night Kids.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.550
Your name ?

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.880
Fujiwara Takumi.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.700
I'll remember your name.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.650
Start counting down in five...

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:50.550
Four...

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.490
Three...

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.370
Two...

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.380
One...

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:54.030
Go !

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.150
Takumi, go for it !

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.550
I'll let you enjoy the Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour from the best seat in the house, Keisuke.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.700
Nakazato's going easy on the
 gas to wait for the Eight-Six.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.000
<c.white>It's meaningless to 
out-accelerate him on a straightaway.</c>

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.460
<c.white>I want a battle.
 The real start begins in the corner.</c>

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.000
<c.white>You've gotta be kidding !</c>

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.670
<c.white>There's no way you can stay behind me with that overly showy crab-like driving !</c>

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.000
I'm impressed.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.350
Watching his driving this close,
 it reminds me that his drift is an art.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.900
Even I can't control my FC like that at the limit.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.090
But wouldn't a non-turbo Eight-Six eventually lose because of the lack of power ?

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:17.160
A turbo is a powerful aid in straightaways, but its
 power will make the car unstable at the exit of corners.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.170
It's a double-edge sword.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.150
But once you get the Eight-Six at the right angle, you can step on the gas as you like.

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:30.990
In a technical course, an under-powered car can be faster if you can be aggressive on the accelerator.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:40.100
Come to think of it, I could barely use the full 
throttle of my 350 HP engine on Akina's downhill.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.100
You go boom, and you have to brake right after.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.200
It was also frustrating that I had 
to use partial throttle so often.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.650
That's the nature of the FR layout.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.000
Nature of the FR ?

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.100
 Wait, Brother ! 
What about the GT-R's 4WD ?!

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:03.060
Its ATTESA E-TS can let you step on the gas without losing control, so you can use the turbo power as much as you like.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.900
<c.white>This is it.</c>

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:21.000
<c.white>This feeling of high tension, like
 the blood in my entire body is boiling.</c>

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.500
<c.white>This is a battle !</c>

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.050
The Eight-Six is falling behind.

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.500
Nakazato may be a big talker, but he's good.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.500
He minimizes the under-steer by 
transferring the weight skillfully.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.500
It's the type of driving that
makes use of the GT-R's power.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.000
It looks boring, but he doesn't drive wastefully, giving no overtaking opportunities.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.590
You can't be so relaxed, Brother.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:50.870
It'd be humiliating to allow the 
Night Kids to defeat the Eight-Six.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.970
I doubt that will happen.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.750
The first half has many 
straightaways and the slopes are mild.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:03.620
The slope is steep in the second half, and that's where the downhill specialist will show his true potential.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.780
What amazing drift !

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.820
That's Akina's Eight-Six.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.990
Incredible.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.670
This must be a dream !

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.150
Takahashi Ryosuke's FC ?!

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.460
What's going on ? 
A three-way match ?

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.430
Is this going to determine
 who's the fastest in Gunma ?!

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.400
<c.white>Low-speed hairpin curves 
are the GT-R's area of specialty.</c>

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.390
<c.white>If you can use the powerful
 brakes to slow down like you should...</c>

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.710
<c.white>...the weight will shift to the front regardless.</c>

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.900
<c.white>The biggest weakness of losing 
front tire grip can be minimized. </c>

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:59.520
<c.white>And this is the moment of truth.</c>

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:05.880
<c.white>This acceleration from the low gear is unmatched, and the stiff body is steady as a rock.</c>

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.360
<c.white>The fastest machine on the circuit
 is the fastest on the public roads.</c>

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.300
<c.white>The R badge on the rear right 
symbolizes the R's unbeaten legend.</c>

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.850
<c.white>Can you keep up with my R, Eight-Six ?</c>

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.000
<c.white>It's different...</c>

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.040
<c.white>Something's different.</c>

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.850
You changed the suspension setting ?

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.460
Heavy under-steer when you open the throttle.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.620
Heavy under-steer ? 
What're you thinking, Bunta ?

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.860
Takumi will have to drift. 
If the suspension is...

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.760
You don't know anything.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:47.000
When it comes to the FR, a skilled driver can 
maintain full throttle longer because of under-steering.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:49.650
It's even more true when drifting.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.210
I didn't tell Takumi about it, though...

00:28:55.210 --> 00:29:01.060
You didn't ? He must be freaked out by 
now because of it's different handling.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:09.460
It's pointless to tell him because he's not smart enough to change his driving style after thinking it through.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.000
If that's the case...

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:16.630
He may not be smart, but what
 he's learned with his body is real.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:20.480
Minor modifications to the 
suspension won't bother him.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.910
Bunta...

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.440
Takumi should be able to figure it out.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.650
The Eight-Six is the type of car 
that can train the driver after all.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.040
<c.white>It's different.
 It's definitely different.</c>

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.650
<c.white>The car remains stable when
 I'm pressing harder on the pedal.</c>

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:42.760
<c.white>I can start pressing the pedal a bit earlier.</c>

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.680
<c.white>I don't have to hesitate because
 the car doesn't skid too much.</c>

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.800
<c.white>I see it, Dad.</c>

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.500
<c.white>This is why you closed the shop.</c>

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.390
<c.white>I don't know how it works, but it feels good.</c>

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.950
Amazing. 
My eyes can barely keep up.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.000
<c.white>I lost to that technique.</c>

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.500
<c.white>He started to drop the
 inside tire into the gutter.</c>

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.310
He must have gotten serious. 
He's going nuts.

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.850
<c.white>The Eight-Six is gaining on me !</c>

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.150
<c.white> Ridiculous !</c>

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:32.990
<c.white>That's impossible !</c>

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.400
<c.white>Very well done.</c>

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:54.320
<c.white>My presumption about the Eight-Six being an
 under-powered classic is gone if you can push it that hard.</c>

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.000
<c.white>It's a wonderful machine with
top-notch combat potential.</c>

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.650
<c.white>I'm so thrilled.</c>

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:05.540
<c.white>I haven't had an exciting battle 
like this since I switched to this car.</c>

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.550
In low-speed corners, even though the Eight-Six can almost bite the GT-R's tail during the entry...

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.650
...the gap widens at the exit because
 of the difference in initial acceleration.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.800
But in high-speed corners,
 the Eight-Six can narrow the gap.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.250
The street racers all talk about having to aim at the very inside of the corners, but he's extraordinary.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.800
<c.white>The bumper almost rubs the guard rails...</c>

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.700
<c.white>...as the car takes the shortest path while 
drifting with four wheels at its limit.</c>

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:54.400
<c.white>In order for the under-powered Eight-Six to
 maintain speed he avoids wasteful deceleration.</c>

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.720
<c.white>That's why he uses drift.</c>

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.440
<c.white>He's in a class of his own. This has 
nothing to do with vehicle performance.</c>

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.990
<c.white>That bastard must have a few screws loose !</c>

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.290
<c.white>His pressure is tremendous.</c>

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.320
<c.white>Why can't I shake it ?</c>

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.760
Dammit !
 I'm so glad to be alive !

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.730
I wonder where Takumi is at right now ?

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:36.000
Given the incredible speed,
 he must have gone down quite far.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.060
<c.white>If that Eight-Six turns out
 to be a worthy opponent...</c>

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:47.000
<c.white>...the GT-R's weakness will 
hit Takeshi just about now.</c>

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.610
The GT-R's weakness ? What's that ?

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.560
Simply put, the body weight.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.000
Body weight ?

00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:03.430
The GT-R's weakness is under-steering
 because of its super heavy front section.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.150
Even if you try to mitigate it 
with tuning or driving technique...

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.360
...you can't change the basic characteristics.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:14.720
If you continue a forceful steering manner as you use the ABS on the hard downhill...

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.150
...the front tires and brakes will lose their grip.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:25.720
By the time you reach the bottom, you'll be 
fighting under-steering at the entrance of corners.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.440
Even with a well-tuned brake system.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.870
The response from the front has become dull. 
It's slightly under-steering.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.250
The stress to the front 
tires was greater than expected.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.110
This is gonna be tough.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.480
But I must not lose !

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600
They're here !

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.900
The Eight-Six is right on its tail !

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.510
Nakazato's the fastest in Myogi, 
but he's being pressed hard !

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.900
I saw you overtake Takahashi 
Keisuke in these five hairpin curves.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.820
You only have to keep the inside closed. I'll never open the inside no matter what.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.200
What the...?

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.210
From the outside ?!

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.030
<c.white>Don't screw around with me, you brat !</c>

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:30.070
Did you see that ?

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.790
That was insane. 
It drifted through this narrow road.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.040
<c.white>From the outside again ?</c>

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.040
<c.white>It's so annoying !</c>

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:45.170
The GT-R's motion is unstable. 
Nakazato must be losing concentration.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.500
Keisuke, the Eight-Six's going
 to overtake, so don't miss it !

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:55.650
<c.white>I see.</c>

00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.900
<c.white>
Because I'm trying to block the inside too much, I'm not 
braking hard enough and I'm not taking the ideal cornering line.</c>

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.950
<c.white>I can enter the corners a little faster if I leave just enough space that's too narrow for him to pass.</c>

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.700
<c.white>He's taking the outer line, 
which means he won't take the inside !</c>

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.580
<c.white>It's gone. Where...where is it?</c>

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.000
<c.white>The outer line was a feint motion !</c>

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.490
<c.white> He changed his line while full braking ?!</c>

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.100
That was a brilliant move, but...

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.300
...starting from side-by-side, I can still pull 
ahead using full acceleration in second gear.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.460
I'll show you the true potential of the RB26 !

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:04.160
<c.white>It lost...?
The GT-R lost...</c>

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.900
<c.white>No, that's not it. 
I'm the one who lost.</c>

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.660
<c.white>The GT-R didn't lose to the Eight-Six.</c>

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.120
<c.white>It's a shock, but somehow it feels good.</c>

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.700
<c.white>I did everything I could.</c>

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.590
<c.white>There're plenty of great drivers out there.</c>

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.200
<c.white>And there's quite a few of them
 driving the mountain passes. </c>

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.370
That was fun, wasn't it, Keisuke ?

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.100
That was great.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.800
It pressured the GT-R really 
hard during braking on the downhill.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.100
The Eight-Six must have
high-performance ABS.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.700
What're you talking about ? 
You think the Eight-Six has ABS ?

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.400
The driver's right foot is superior
to machine-controlled ABS.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:02.600
I haven't been this excited in a long time. 
I have to rewrite a big chunk of my paper.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.800
That Eight-Six is a really worthy target to defeat.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.760
Brother...

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.660
T...Takumi...

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.630
...won ?!

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.590
Are you serious ?

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.900
I'm checking now.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.130
Apparently, it's true.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.090
It can't be true.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:24.210
No way.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:50.210
<c.white>Looks like you are the one
 who was humiliated, Takeshi.</c>

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.130
<c.white>You can't act tough for quite a while.</c>

00:37:53.130 --> 00:38:00.000
<c.white>When I defeat the Eight-Six, then I, Shoji Shingo, will become the leader of the Night Kids.</c>

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:07.560
<c.white>Just wait, Eight-Six. I'll send you to the junk yard by fighting under emotional, yet dangerous rules.</c>

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.000
Eat one.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.630
Thank you.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.000
Hot...

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:35.120
This is awkward.
 I've begun to look at you differently.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.150
Huh ? What do you mean ?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.120
Right now, you're the usual Takumi.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.500
But once you get in the Eight-Six and are 
thrust into the night mountain pass...

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.310
...you become an admirable
 hero of Akina's street racers.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.650
Huh ? Really ?

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:53.950
That's what this is all about ?
 You make me feel embarrassed, Itsuki.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.210
Although you're just an airhead
 munching on a sweet bun right now.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.800
"Airhead," you say ?

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.060
I feel awkward, too.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:10.700
But if someone becomes happy because of what I do, that makes me really happy.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:15.700
I see. I didn't know you were the
 type who'd do things for others.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:20.000
Driving is slowly becoming fun.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.830
Iketani's car is repaired.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.450
That's good.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.330
Let's go to Akina tonight.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:30.070
Sure. 

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.870
You look happy.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.800
Of course. 
I finally got my baby back.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.500
The S13 Silvia, that is.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.750
When did it...?!

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.430
It tapped my bumper.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.800
You want me to move because I'm too slow ?

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:31.700
Screw you !

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.090
T...Takumi...

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.780
Itsuki, Iketani, are you alright ?

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.300
I'm fine, more or less.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.630
Apologize ? 
You've gotta be kidding.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.700
Don't screw around with us !

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.160
You hit us on purpose !
 You could have injured us really bad !

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:44.650
Like I said before, it was your fault.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.870
I didn't expect your corner entry to be so slow.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.170
No one could react fast 
enough to avoid a little bonk.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.660
Say what ?

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.420
He's rubbing our nose in it.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:05.650
If you insist, I will kneel down and apologize only if
 you can defeat us in a downhill battle under our rules.

00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:10.660
I don't mind if that Eight-Six
 driver over there is my opponent.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.400
You're good at the downhill, right ?

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.240
What're you going to do ?

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.000
So, are you Speed Stars boys in or not ?

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:28.000
If you lose, you'll kneel 
down and apologize, right ?

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:32.400
He's only provoking you, Takumi. 
You don't know what he might do.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.200
I won't lose to a guy like him, Iketani.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.210
Wait, you said something about rules.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.000
It's really not a big deal.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.140
We call it the gum tape death match.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:02.000
You tape your right hand
 to the steering wheel and race.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.300
That's all.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.880
Stop. Don't do this, Takumi.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.120
This's insane. It's so risky.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.200
You know what this means ?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.000
You can't steer as much !

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:30.650
If you can't do that how are you
 going to clear the corners ?!

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.510
But the conditions will be equal.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:37.930
He must have practiced !
That's why he brought up a rule like this !

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.670
This's just too risky, even for you !
Please don't, Takumi !

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.300
I won't quit, Iketani.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.060
I don't know why, but I don't want 
to lose to that guy no matter what.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.170
Takumi...

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.300
You can go first, Eight-Six boy.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.000
Go !

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.520
They're off.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.700
We've gotta go, too !

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.420
Impossible !
 We'll never catch them !

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.150
I'm not thinking about catching them !

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.530
If Takumi crashes, I want to
 help him as soon as possible !

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.300
There's no need for two downhill specialists.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:27.800
This EG6 Civic driver Shoji Shingo of the Myogi 
Night Kids is the fastest downhill driver in Gunma.

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.300
Let's see how many corners you can clear.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.250
<c.white>You're done.</c>

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.750
<c.white>Damn, how did he recover from that ?</c>

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.100
<c.white>But it's only a matter of time.</c>

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:09.600
No matter how good the driver is, you must apply a 
counter-steer to stop the over-steering of an FR car.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.480
Right, but the Civic is an FF, so...

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:17.700
...you can stop over-steering with the accelerator, 
so you can dive into corners more aggressively.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.550
And you can mitigate under-steering 
by pulling the parking brake.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.050
Under this rule, you'll crash
 unless you drive an FF car.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:30.010
If someone can avoid an accident
 in an FR car, he must be a monster.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:40.550
I feel so uneasy after every corner because
 I might see a wrecked Eight-Six at any moment.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.750
<c.white>I feel like he's gonna be alright.
 It's Takumi, after all.</c>

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.590
<c.white>Why ? Why can he turn ?</c>

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.200
<c.white>The gum tape death match is not
 easy for a first timer to manage.</c>

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.810
<c.white>See ? I can pass you
 any time if I want to.</c>

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.480
<c.white>Why don't you feel the heat ?
 Attack harder and crash.</c>

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.650
<c.white>I can go...</c>

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.090
<c.white>...faster than usual.</c>

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.600
<c.white>I can go faster if I depend less on the steering.</c>

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.650
<c.white>What the hell ?</c>

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.350
<c.white>No matter how much pressure 
I put on him, he remains stable.</c>

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:59.600
<c.white>In fact, he's getting faster.</c>

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:13.630
I don't give a damn ! 
Victory is all that matters in a battle...

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.650
...regardless of how !

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.100
Damn, what a lucky ass brat.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.760
Well then, I'll just pull away right here !

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.300
<c.white>This is it. The sound of the engine
 revving all the way up to the red zone.</c>

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.600
<c.white>I just can't get enough 
of this intoxicating feeling !</c>

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.200
<c.white>You did that on purpose.</c>

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:06.750
I will not lose to a scumbag
 like you, no matter what !

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:30.000
No way ! 
How can he keep up ?!

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.850
I'm driving at my ultimate speed !

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.500
<c.white>What's going on with that Eight-Six ?</c>

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.900
<c.white>He's not using the steering...</c>

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:49.000
<c.white>...but turning by only shifting the weight !</c>

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:20.230
What the hell was that ?! 
How did he pass me in a place like that ?!

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:38.000
<c.white>If I lose the very gum 
tape death match I set up...</c>

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.820
<c.white>...I'll be a laughingstock among my team members, and never be able to redeem myself.</c>

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.000
<c.white>I have to save my rep even 
if that means I have to resort to a tie.</c>

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:56.240
The end of this battle is a double crash !

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:50.370
<c.white>My EG6...</c>

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.400
Ouch. You really blew it.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.760
Hey, are you alright ? Are you hurt ?

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.500
I think my right arm is broken because
 of the kickback from the steering wheel.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:33.070
Hop in. I'll take you to the hospital. 
It's faster than calling an ambulance.

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.370
I can't owe you that much.

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:37.450
Don't be so hard on yourself.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.350
 It hurts, right ? 
 We'll take care of the mess here.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.200
We're used to things like this.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.450
Don't be a stranger.
 Crashes happen to anyone.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.210
We are locals, so we know
 the emergency hospital.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.870
As he says.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.350
Thanks, I owe you one.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.180
So Takumi won.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.000
He's incredible, isn't he ?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.300
I ended up facing a really annoying a-hole, 
and I snapped during the race.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.950
After that, I don't remember what happened.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:51.800
When we lose ourselves, both you
 and I don't know when to stop.

00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:55.850
But I'd never damage the car.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.000
So, did you win ?

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:02.820
Yeah. 

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:07.150
I see.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:19.650
Like Itsuki and Iketani say, street racers 
love cars and take good care of them, but I...

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:27.550
I'm sorry.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.500
It's worn out real bad.

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.900
I might as well replace it while
 the car's in the body shop.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.510
It's hot again today.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:09.800
You're incredible.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:15.460
No street racer will challenge
 you to a downhill battle in Akina.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:16.920
I don't think so.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:22.710
There're plenty of good drivers in
 Gunma, because its skill level is high.

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.310
I don't think Takahashi Ryosuke
 of the Red Suns can remain quiet.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.800
Takahashi Ryosuke, huh ?

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:34.000
Speaking of which, he's fast.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:40.200
 When I was fighting the GT-R,
 a white RX7 was right on my tail.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:45.300
I was occupied chasing the GT-R at the time...

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.250
...but looking back on it, he concerns me.

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:55.050
I know for sure. He's really fast,
 faster than anyone we've ever seen.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:58.590
I see. Probably so.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:05.570
Hey, Takumi, what would you do if 
a great racer like him challenged you ?

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.550
You won't accept, right ?

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:14.600
If that happens...

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:18.070
...I'll take a shot.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.620
I finally found you !

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:29.200
Mogi...?

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.600
Why are you here ?

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:39.430
You only mentioned "gas station," so I've been looking for your work place for a long time.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.200
Why ?

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.400
Because I wanted to see you at work.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.560
Itsuki, who is she ?

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.000
A classmate, but um...

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:53.570
Your bellybutton's showing.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.000
That's fine.
 This's how it's supposed to look.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:02.150
Hello. I have a flower delivery,
 and need your signature.

00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:07.150
It's addressed to Mr. Panda Trueno.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:09.040
Panda Trueno...?

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.660
Takumi, that must be you.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:12.580
Me ?

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:16.000
A bouquet for Takumi ?

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.450
From who ?

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:20.900
There. A letter.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.250
Open it quickly.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000
From who ? Who is it ?

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.360
So who sent it ?

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.200
August 27th at 10PM

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.200
 Will be waiting at the peak of Mt. Akina

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.200

Even when my ears are covered, I hear the heartbeat getting...

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:19.200
...faster and faster.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:25.000
Try to find the right answer, but there's no such thing.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.300
Hey daddy, tell me... I wonder why those people fight.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:41.850
For their name ? For their cash, or for their pride ?

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:44.400
Those piercingly honest eyes of yours.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.200
I'm going down. (I'm going down.)

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.500
But everybody's saying, "We're right all the time."

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.300
`cuz they want to stick to absolute justice.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.800
They're never turning back. Never want to be denied.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.200
But it's falling down. (It's falling down)

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.400
Patching up the open wounds with the past.

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:08.650
Remembering the pain that never fades away.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:12.650
I draw my blade.

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:18.650
It's not about becoming a hero to save the world.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:23.200
Instead, until my voice wears thin...

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:33.000
...I want to sing of the future when the crybaby next to me only smiles.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.650
 I continue to fight.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.250
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to ? Dumb ass !

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.900
"Don't get carried away," says a snot-nose brat.

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.500
Gutsy, for now, and goes "Should I kick `eem asses?"

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.200
With a faint voice. "Whacha say, huh ?"

00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:04.650
When I close my eyes, I see your tears burnt into mine.

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:10.050
I swear to myself. I'll never back down.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:17.650
It's not about becoming a hero to save the world.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.500
Instead, until my voice wears thin...

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:32.900
...I want to sing of the future when the crybaby next to me only smiles.

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.050
Someday, I want our future to be...

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:43.650
...the place where we can laugh away our tough times.

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:53.350
In the pouring rain, I long for your heart to be as open as the sunny sky.

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:55.550
I continue to fight.
