Ordered to help with the family business - his
father's tofu shop - Takumi Fujiwara began
delivering tofu by car in his first year of middle school.
Initially he did not want to start driving. However,
without realizing it, he began to acquire marvelous
driving techniques from his daily runs.
In his third year of high school, as he was coming
down Akina after completing a delivery like he
always did, Ryosuke Takashi of the Akagi
Red Suns appeared before him.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:28.990 line:50 %
After his unexpected battle debut at the cape,
written challenges came to Takumi one after
another.
During the challenges, his meetings with the Red
Suns Ryosuke Takahashi - who touted the
"theory of the maximum speed on highways" and
aimed to dominate Gunma - influenced Takumi's
course greatly.
When he graduated, Takumi decided to join
the out-of-province visitation team "Project D"
 led by Ryosuke.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.660 line:50 %
Project D's very first Kanto visitation stage
was Tochigi. This battle's opponent is the
Tochigi Seven Star Leaf's kamikaze downhiller,
Toru Suetsugu/ Receiving Ryosouke's advice - that
overcoming the coverless gutters is key to
winning - the battle begins in a front-lead,
rear-chase style.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.590
Choosing the lead was right for me.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.740
After all, having your rhythm broken while going downhill spells your end.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.480
Using every last bit of my skill is more important than winning.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.050
I can win this battle!

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.160
H–He’s right on me!

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.540
How?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.500
I’m on a roll. This is my best race ever.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.400
What the hell is going on?

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.560
His charge-in is amazing.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.090
He knows everything about this course.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.990
However,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.740
the 86 is faster while he recovers from a corner and the next time he brakes.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.830
He’s an extraordinary driver.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.350
I can’t lose him!

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.090
I need to see how he drives from behind him.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.340
What kind of driver is he?

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.800
I want to see how he tackles my home course,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.020
how he does it differently.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.660
I’ll make this go into a second round.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.560
I need to see his technique!

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.560
I can see the line!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.050
Bastard!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.570
Aren’t you afraid of the uncovered gutters at all?!

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.000
Shit!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.230
I won’t let you have it!

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.050
If I get ahead by at least a third, then I’ll have control!

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.730
I won’t give you the space!

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.280
I won’t let you pass!

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.680
What the hell?!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.790
Impossible!

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.170
I haven’t given him enough room.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.260
There’s no road there!

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.300
What is he driving on?!

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.810
He passed me!

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.560
Am I dreaming or something?!

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.980
What just happened?

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.610
Shit!

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.400
If an 86 can do it, then so can my car!

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.900
No! I can’t get back!

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:40.640 line:50 %
Atsurou Kawai feels intimidated by Keisuke,
who's calm even though he's facing an opponent
of unknown skill on a brand new course. Following
Toru's advice of "protect your own pace," the hill
climb battle begins.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.480
Two!

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.720
One!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.390
Go!

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.700
He’s pulling ahead on the straights.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.610
His engine is powerful,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.160
but the issue is how much of that power he can use.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.090
I won’t use the same trick as Fujiwara.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.130
I’ll leave the circus tricks to him.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.880
I’m going to do things my own way.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.390
I’m D’s ace!

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.410
The 34 isn’t light by any means, but it has the heart to pull it through.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.620
The only thing it needs is power!

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.130
You don’t have to take control of the inside so much.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.130
I don’t plan on going that way.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.640
I already decided not to use the same method as him.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.150
Pass me if you can, pretty boy.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.400
Don’t get so cocky.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.900
I know your weakness!

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.660
I have a greater ability to recover.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.870
I can pull ahead faster on the straightaways.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.130
I’ve got it!

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.920
I can break away from him in the first round!

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.920
That was some messed up cornering.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.130
Your driving isn’t interesting in the least.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.680
You just rely on power and mash the gas as much as you can, whenever you can.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.680
It's not so simple to deal with the mountain pass.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.690
But if you ask me, that kind of driving is weak.

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.690
Even an idiot can accelerate on a straight course.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.690
I wasn’t trained by my theory-loving brother for nothing!

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.200
I’ll show you!

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:01.200
The real maximum speed theory learned directly from Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.760
Even if you stick to my ass in the corners,
I can lose you as much as I want on the straights!

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.520
What?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.020
What’s this?!

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.530
I told you that you were weak.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:41.030
A straightaway’s top speed acceleration relies on how a driver recovers from a corner.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.040
It’s cornering that emphasizes recovery.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:11:00.860 line:50 %
The Todo School: a driving technique training class
set up by former rally racer Todo to find and train
a successor. The current best driver at Todo school,
where even pros attend, is Daiku Ninojima. Daiku loses
interest when he finds out his opponent is an 86 and
chooses to take the rear in the front-lead, rear-chase.
Takumi receives two pieces of advice from Ryosuke
and starts.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.580
Go!

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.230
Oh?

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:34.720
Does the Todo School even have someone who could drive at this level after spending only one night on the course?

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.750
And his car…

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.240
I don’t know how he tuned it,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.910
but it can accelerate as quickly as the B16B engine,
and on top of that, it corners well.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.720
That’s no 86.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.020
I need to break past him somewhere.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:02.500
Everyone knows that an FR is faster than an FF in this class.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.120
And this is the ultimate Type-R.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.830
I can’t stay behind an 86 forever.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.540
I’ll end this in one round no matter what!

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:50.120
I can tell that he’s stuck right on me without looking into my rearview.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.830
I feel the pressure tingling painfully on my back,

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.630
but I can concentrate pretty well since I decided not to look behind me.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.700
I screwed up.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.400
I made a mistake by choosing to be the chaser in the first round.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.590
It’s like I’m the one having a hard time here.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.040
Okay, round two!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.090
No one can keep up with my speed! I’ll end this right away!

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.750
He’s fast!

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.610
There’s no room. He’s right at the limit.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.320
He’s faster than he was in the first round!

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.080
I’m frightened.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.800
If I get off the accelerator, I’m done.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.750
But it’d make this so much easier.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.690
Another part of myself is telling me "Don't aim for it!"

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.830
I can’t lose him!

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.780
He’s sticking to this pace, even though it’s several levels faster than the first round’s!

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.310
Hell of a thing to do…

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.190
That was a big mistake.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.080
I put unnecessary stress on my tires!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.310
It’s not just my imagination.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.890
His lead-in is getting slower.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.510
His tires?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.280
His tires are losing traction due to heat.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.750
Right now, my tires are still intact.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.660
I’ll break past this fast EK and end this!

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.050
What?!

Particular about FF cars, Sakai drives an aftermarket
turbocharged integra. He's been given the nickname
"Smiley" because he seems to smile when he's
concentrating and tense. Sakai swears to avenge Daiki.
The battle rages on, using tactics to screw up the
FD's rhythm.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.300
He’s fast.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.510
So, an FF can get this much traction going uphill.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.530
He’s fast!

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.030
Is he stupid?!

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.790
Combining the Integra Type-R with a turbocharger was the right way to go.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:56.330
In addition to this car’s mobility, it adds enough torque to accelerate uphill.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.530
Now, follow me.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.080
The trap I set is already in motion.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.560
I’ll show you the Todo School’s indecent side.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.560
I’ll avenge Daiki.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.570
He’s really driving hard.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:21.070
I thought the locals here were pretty good,
but I’m beginning to understand his rhythm.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.830
He’s a good driver.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.830
He’s got a hang of the line and timing,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.040
but that’s going to cost him.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.040
The open maw of a pitfall is waiting for you.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.570
What?!

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.840
Son of a bitch, he got me!

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.840
He’s using my time lag between slowing down and boosting back up to his advantage.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.340
He’s still green.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.850
Feints using the brake lights are used every day at the Todo School.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.350
A battle isn’t just about fairly competing with speed.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.860
The Todo School’s tactics are for the mastery of disrupting the opponent’s rhythm.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:39.370
Just remember that there are many different kinds of techniques for winning.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.970
I won’t let you go!

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.570
I’ll definitely catch up!

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.310
Damn it!

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.930
I got caught in his rhythm and charged in too much!

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.830
Don’t go!

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.260
Not that way!

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.340
Come back!

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.460
Please, come back!

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.050
Yeah!

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.440
I got through!

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.790
W–What?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.230
That was a double-layered trap;

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.690
muddling his rhythm with the brake light, and then forcing him to be impatient.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.830
He recovered from that?

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.250
He’s catching up.

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.250
I can’t lose, for the sake of the Todo School’s reputation.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.290
No matter what, I’ll reach the goal first!

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.600
Come on, B18C turbo!

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.320
Hell of a thing to happen.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.170
Normally, this corner alone isn’t a problem,

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:54.950
but just having another car present while trying to control my racing line is killing my speed.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:00.500
I never imagined a new, low-speed corner would be created just because of him.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:31.620 line:50 %
Tomoyuki Tachi is a professional driver who got
his start at the Todo School. When he hit a wall in
his racing activities, Todo tells him "try street
racing again." A rematch of the 86 - which now
has a carbon fiber hood to make the car
lighter - and the EK9, the Todo Shop's demo car,
is about to begin.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.080
Go!

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.770
The narrow, hard-to-predict road suddenly changes after this point.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:12.700
The brand new second section that just underwent widening…

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.830
It looks pretty, but the surface is horrible.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.830
The asphalt’s joints are bumpy and bounce the car.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:26.130
He seems to have the power, but how long will the 86’s old suspension hold up?

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.360
Now we start the third section, a tight downhill.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.580
I can’t play with you for too long.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.920
I have to save face as a pro.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.940
He’s passing me <i>here?!</i>

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.180
It’s uphill after this bridge.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.860
If my car doesn’t have enough power, I won’t be able to keep up.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:35.920
Come on, 86!

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.910
I’m counting on your heart!

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.040
What?!

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.550
I can't shake him. It's a little embarassing.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.160
Adjusting the gear ratio to make the best

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.560
of the top-speed portion on this course to counter the FD, which gains speed on straights,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.320
is working against me here.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.510
My gear ratio isn’t suited for low-speed, uphill corners.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.660
It’s hard to notice going downhill, but it shows on the uphill.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.880
The gears on the 86 behind me are working together better.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:37.930
But more importantly, since being overtaken, this 86 is more focused.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.520
At this rate, there’ll never be any space for me to pass.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.000
What do I do?!

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.500
I can do it if he can’t see me!

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.540
I’ll just have to try it!

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.210
Now!

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.050
He’s gone.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.060
The 86 disappeared from my mirrors!

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.520
This isn’t the sound of my car.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.060
Are you right there?!

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.980
What?!

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.810
He got me.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:44.370
This is the first time I’ve been passed by a car I passed earlier.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.980
But I won’t hold back anymore!

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.710
We’re headed to snake hairpin number 4.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:03.720
I’ll teach you that old-school races had this kind of passing.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.110
I didn’t bump you hard enough to spin you.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.780
It’s just enough to break an opponent’s posture.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.950
The goal is getting close.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.410
That again?

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.370
Don’t be foolish!

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.420
Do you think you can drive through this pass in the dark?!

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.680
There’s nowhere to pass in this last section, though.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.390
I’m going to win!

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.880
I won’t give up.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.150
I’ll get it next time.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:35.980 line:50 %
Finishing the battles in Tochigi, Project D completed
their first step towards dominating Kanto. Still tired
from the previous day's battle, Takumi delivers tofu
as usual, but a set of headlights follow him.
Without even knowing who the driver is,
Takumi does his best to escape...

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.910
Someone’s following me.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.130
He’s fast.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.520
I don’t really feel like yielding.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.350
Besides, we’re going downhill on Akina.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.800
This guy’s amazing!

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.220
One hell of a driver’s come out of nowhere!

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:53.770
He may be the best I’ve seen on Akina.

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.120
I’ll just have to lose him with this trick.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.420
I don’t believe it!

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:03.000
No way… I can’t even lift a finger against someone I can’t beat with braking.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:15.130 line:50 %
Takumi takes Itsuki's turbocharged 85 out for the
first time in a while, along with Iketani's S13.
There, an S15 passes them both. A confident duo
from Tokyo waited, and challenged them to a battle.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.200
Okay.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.610
I’ll get going too!

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:44.380
I trained at the circuit driving club.
I won’t lose on the uphill or downhill.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.760
It’s my first battle in a long time.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.980
I’ve gotten confident in my technique all over again.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.760
I really am fast.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.990
I might be pretty cool.

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.370
Not good. You’re about to be passed, Iketani.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.370
For real?

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.290
On the straightaway after this corner.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.300
Idiots!

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.510
That’s all there is to it.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.430
You can’t keep up with me!

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.850
I learned full braking at the circuit!

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.460
How about that?

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.250
A full-brake charge after maxing out my speed.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.870
There’s no way they could keep up–

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.860
Cocky bastards! You’re just an S13!

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.550
You’re wrong if you think you can keep up with me!

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:22.600
The braking I trained for at the circuit is being defeated by a street racer?!

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.830
Impossible!

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.900
That’s not possible!

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.710
Um…

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.960
After taking a close look, the car behind us isn’t an S13–

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.860
Sorry! Don’t talk to me for a while.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.450
I can’t concentrate.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.660
You’re about to do “it,” aren’t you?

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.160
Yeah.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.540
Now!

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.340
Here it comes, my ultimate skill:

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.340
Extreme Ultra Super Late Braking!

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.540
Not good!

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.270
We’re about to crash!

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:32.320 line:50 %
Keisuke - who came to inspect the next stage, the
Saitama pass - happens to meet the local hill-climb
ace, Kyoko Iwase. Without knowing who her opponent
would be, Kyoko fell head over heels for Keisuke. On
the day of the battle, Kyoko wavers after finding out
that her opponent is Keisuke. With mixed feelings in
her heart, a battle between FD's is about to begin.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.220
We’re about to start!

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:45.810
Go!

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:54.850
She’s good.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.530
She’s good, but why?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.980
Is she good enough to give me a challenge?

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.120
Right now, I’m all that he’s thinking about.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.120
That’s enough to make me happy.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:12.150
Just watch, darling. This is who I am.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.340
I’m surprised. She’s fast.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.220
Let’s go, my 13B turbo! Roar!

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.520
No matter how you look at it,
I’m the one having trouble accelerating.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.770
She said she had a single turbine.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.560
What does that mean?

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:37.040
I’ve never faced such delicate acceleration before.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.200
This is amazing.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.570
I feel sparks.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.790
I feel his hot gaze burning into my back.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.270
I want to keep driving like this forever.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.970
The goal is already near.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.970
If I can keep this up, we’ll go into a second round.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.060
I see!

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.410
I got it, Bro!

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.550
The single turbine’s weakness!

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.360
How pathetic. Why didn’t I realize it sooner?

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.920
It’s really fast when it can drive smoothly.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.670
The moment it’s disrupted is when it shows its fragility.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.670
A single turbo setup is peaky!

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:21.880
She can’t hit her accelerator, and her boost level is low!

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.380
Now!

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.010
It’s time for the lag-less twin turbo to shine!

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.480
Don’t pass me!

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.580
I want to keep going!

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.380
I don’t want to end this!

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.360
Don’t go, darling!

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:57.510 line:50 %
His downhill opponent, Nobuhiko, was a cousin of his
past opponent Wataru. Nobuhiko chose the rear to
study the 86's driving in order to pass it along to the
Saitama showdown's second round driver. On the
other side, Takumi is advised by Ryosuke to stick with
his opponent's pace until the first hairpin.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.590
I’m aware that I won’t be able to keep up,

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:13.390
but I need to study this 86’s driving as much as possible.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:14.630
Five seconds to go!

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.780
Four!

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.800
Three!

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.880
Two!

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.900
One!

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.400
Go!

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.650
Amazing. I mean, how risky.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:38.570
What a charge.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.270
I’ll put all five of my senses into overdrive.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.780
I’ll make my body memorize it –

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.460
the essence of his superhuman speed and technique!

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:57.660 line:50 %
Saitama finals, round 2. Nobuhiko devised a plan to
beat the 86 from his experience in his last race.
It was a plan that used the greatest weapon in a
downhill race: "lightness." Giving Sakamoto - a rally
racer he'd been introduced to by Wataru - his final
weapon, the "Cappucino," the final battle began in
the rain.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.890
Five seconds until we start!

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.130
Four!

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.130
Three!

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.090
Two!

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:10.730
One!

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:11.340
Go!

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:28.830
He’s fast.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.860
He’s insanely fast!

00:40:55.850 --> 00:40:57.890
What do I do?!

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:04.480
I’ve never been unable to enter a corner as fast as the car ahead of me.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.120
The ratio between the contact of the tires and road, and the friction…

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.960
The lower the <font face="Arial" size="30">μ is, the more extreme it will be over or under.</c>

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.140
It can be pulled off as long as the car is neutral.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.570
There’s no such car in this world.

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:43.100
But, if you start by making an uncontrollable under-steer or over-steer…

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.430
That’s how I do it.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.350
Four-wheel drifting is basic in rallies where you run rough roads.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.330
During the straightaways in the second half, I can catch up some.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:10.190
Meaning that, during straights, I’m faster.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.540
This really is a first.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.800
I’m winning in power but losing on corners.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:22.750
I want to catch up and put pressure on him!

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.010
I know!

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:29.730
Is this Mr. Kyoichi’s technique?

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.320
I need to shorten this gap if I’m going to make it work!

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.190
I’ll catch up no matter what!

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.450
I’ll catch him no matter what!

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.710
He’s catching up?!

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.330
Damn it.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.400
What the hell are you?!

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.760
He’s making me sick. He’s getting closer and closer!

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.440
When facing an opponent who can beat you at cornering,
give up the fight at the corner.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.870
Lower your speed. Get in a position to get at your acceleration timing quicker.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.160
Increase the time you’re hitting the accelerator by as much as possible.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.110
Isn’t he afraid of anything?

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.430
When you’re this close, the water spray cuts into your headlights.

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.940
It’s already hard enough to see through the rain at night.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:48.520
Now he can’t even see a thing because of what my tires spray up!

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.150
He’s right behind me!

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.090
I’ll catch you!

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:10.410
I won’t let you lose me until I get my chance to counterattack!

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.930
No matter how close he may get,
he won’t be able to pass me.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.020
I just need to switch over to the plan that can’t lose!

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.980
This is it!

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.630
What?!

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:52.580
Don’t get cocky!

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.530
No!

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:58.000
I guess I can’t counter an opponent that’s better at cornering than I am.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.220
No. One more time.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:03.590
I’ll try again at one of these upcoming consecutive corners.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.060
The next will be my last chance!

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.930
Go!

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.590
Idiot! He charged in too deep!

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.610
He dug his own grave!

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.650
I’m going to fall!

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.220
I’m safe.

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.420
I don’t know what happened, but it was incredibly lucky.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.090
But because of that mistake, there’s a gap again.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:42.050
Counters just aren’t going to work.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.510
Then, if I don’t use a counterattack…

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:54.600
This upcoming flat straight is the worst place for me.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.900
I can’t allow him to pass me here!

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.140
I’ll drag this into the second round!

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:06.210
This place has a straight right before the goal?

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.370
If I try, I’ll have a chance.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:11.330
But something’s not right.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.370
What do I do?

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.250
Do I go,

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.730
or do I let him be and take it into the second round?

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.250
What’s the right thing to do?!

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.880
Will he come from the right or the left?!

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.890
I can’t use this car’s little body in a situation like this.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:34.370
Even if I stay in the middle of the road,
there’s space on the left and the right.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.620
I don’t really like this technique, but I won’t give you room to pass!

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.890
The left!

00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.320
I won’t let you get in front of me!

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.540
I’ve got to save face!

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.820
So, you want to win that badly.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.990
If that’s the way you want it…

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:54.420
He disappeared?!

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.870
The 86 disappeared from my mirrors!

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.870
His headlights were right behind me a moment ago!

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:01.170
What’s going on?!

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.880
What the hell?!

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:55.130 line:50 %
Wataru's 86 has been upgraded from it's old turbo
tune to a supercharged one. Wataru believes that he
can find victory in a prolonged battle, while Keisuke
continues to master the acceleration techniques taught
to him by Ryosuke. The battle continues in the rain.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.110
Five seconds until we start!

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.780
Four!

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.960
Three!

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.190
Two!

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.450
One!

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:11.530
Go!

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.680
Once we get to the mid-low speed section,

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:36.740
he won’t be able to use all of his power
no matter how much of it he’s got.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:39.700
It’s a match between drivers!

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.760
The one with the stronger heart wins the street fight!

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.820
The time trials are going to be canceled in this rain anyway.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.160
Prepare for it and go!

00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:29.070
I’m impressed that he’s kept up.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.900
Wet roads are hard to drive on with a high-power turbo car.

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.900
Despite being my enemy, I have to respect his skills.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.690
We’re about to begin round 2!

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.190
Two!

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.190
Let’s do this second round!

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.190
One!

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.190
Yeah!

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.370
No wonder.

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:36.920
With his μ so low, he can’t even use half of his engine’s power.

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.400
I just need to be patient.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.750
My chance will definitely come.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:55.490
He’s right on my ass.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:03.950
This car’s greatest merit is that it gains power by linearly coupling engine rotation.

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:07.790
As long as I hit the accelerator, it will give me stable power.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:16.120
On a winding road with a low average speed,
the supercharger is stronger than a turbo!

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.170
Go!

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.600
Damn it!

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.770
I won’t lose!

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:42.030
Little by little, the Levin’s starting to move funny.

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.950
I guess it’s time for me to make a move.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.910
Not good.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:09.430
I’m beginning to lose control.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.200
I can’t see!

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:31.660
A mid-low speed left corner should be up ahead.

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:10.440 line:50 %
The last battle opponents remaining in the Saitama
area risked money, believing that defeating Project D
with their Evo V and Evo VI would be good
advertisement for their shop. The two would do
anything to win, and laid oil on the road during
Project D's practice, putting the FD out of commission.
Keisuke went into battle with an FD loaned to him by
Kyoko.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:19.650
Two!

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.840
One!

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.960
Go!

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:35.060
I’ll break away from him while he’s getting used to driving a new car.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:37.840
That’s why I took the lead in the first round.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.560
I’ll be taking the win here for sure.

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.330
This is a great car!

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.470
My darling really is special.

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:58.750
Don’t lose, darling!

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.870
A journalist wrote in a car magazine,

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:13.310
“For standard driving, the fastest car in the world is a LanEvo.”

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.310
There’s no place for an FD here.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.570
The era of shaking your ass and playing around is over!

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:28.870
Get the hell out of here!

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.280
I’m not losing him.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.550
Why not?

00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:59.840
I don’t like it.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:02.480
I’m in a LanEvo.

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.970
I’m scared out of my mind and hitting the accelerator around corners.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:11.750
How can a guy who hasn’t even practiced keep up with me?!

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:14.790
Don’t drive so slow!

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.470
You’re going to make your LanEvo cry!

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:39.610
He takes an orthodox S-shaped line that expands to the center of the lane.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.130
I’ll counter it by sticking tight to the inside.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:46.110
It’s tight, but the LanEvo’s tail moves away slightly.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.780
At the next left corner, I’ll increase my cornering speed by taking a wide course,

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.910
and then I’ll break past him on this course’s longest straight!

00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:57.200
Idiot! Doesn’t he know?!

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:02.190
There’s a road construction barricade ahead of here, and the path gets smaller!

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.730
We can’t pass side by side!

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.260
Don’t get any closer!

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.970
I’m already out of space!

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.220
Dumbass!

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.410
What was that?

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:37.620 line:50 %
The LanEvo lost to the FD and must win the next race,
so they put pressure on Takumi before the race. This
time, Ryosuke intentionally does not give him advice,
and lets him run free.

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.970
Five seconds until we start!

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.220
Four!

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:53.340
Three!

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:54.570
Two!

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:55.640
One!

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.740
Go!

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.540
Amazing!

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:43.020
He’s already right behind him!

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:57.070
My speed range is completely different than an 86’s!

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.180
I can keep up.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.260
He isn’t bad, but I don’t feel like I’ll lose.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.430
His braking isn’t any good.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.350
His weakness is braking!

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:38.780
Too easy!

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.450
A little more.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.840
If I get past one more,

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.790
there’s a section where I can take a big lead!

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:56.790
What the hell?!

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.930
My front tire isn’t gripping at all!

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:02.970
All right!

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:07.370
Damn it!

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.980
It’s oil!

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.270
We put it too close to the inside, and I slipped on what was left!

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:22.250
One more!

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.580
I just need to pass him one more time!

00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:32.960
I can take back the win during the next power section with my abilities!

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.040
Just you watch!

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.750
This car has the max speed two-liter turbo!

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.680
It’s not going to lose to a weak 86!

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:56.530
Damn it!

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:57.340
I won’t–

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.980
He charged in with no brakes?!

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:06.900 line:50 %
Keisuke's FD had been repaired and increased it's
capabilities. The stage moves to Ibaraki. The
opponents are Purple Shadow. The master of
acceleration techniques, God Foot Kozo Hoshino.
Hoshino, wanting to race personally rather than leave
the battle in the hands of the current drivers,
proposes a complex stage. The advice given to
Keisuke from Ryosuke is "give your opponent about
a seven second margin at the turning point."
With a type of advice he's never gotten
before in his heart, the battle begins.

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:16.770
Three!

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:17.780
Two!

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:18.900
One!

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.070
Go!

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.660
Three.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.500
Two.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.540
One.

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:49.470
He’s pretty agile for having such a huge body.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.270
Damn, he’s fast.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:29.460
Should I really be giving such a fast opponent a seven second lead?!

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:33.760
If I can’t take it back on the downhill, that’s the end!

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.730
The content of the seven seconds is the problem.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.550
Did he lose me?

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:20.210
No, I feel him.

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.620
He’s just ahead!

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.240
I see him!

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:05.080
So, he’s already come this far.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.540
He’s better than I thought.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.550
Now it’s time to play tag, to see if I can outrun him to the goal!

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:15.890
The battle starts now!

01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:27.610
Goddamn it.

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.270
Half the tires’ widths are half worn!

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:32.490
This car’s heavy body is finally taking its toll!

01:05:59.630 --> 01:06:01.060
Just one more.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.060
I’ll charge in with everything I’ve got!

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.560
Son of a bitch!

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.770
So, I couldn’t do it…

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.760
Go!

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.840
That’s low, old man.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.490
I already know that you’ve got good traction.

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:39.850
What’s the matter?!

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:41.840
Is that all you got?!

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.810
Is that all the rotary rocket’s power?!

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.730
No matter how many times you try to poke,
I just need to keep you from passing.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.220
If I keep ahead until the turnaround, then the battle’s mine.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.950
I won’t lose going downhill!

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:11.070
Can’t be done.

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.460
You can’t pass me in a place like this!

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.050
So, that’s how it is.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:21.250
I got a feel for it.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:25.420
I’m almost at the summit.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.060
I’m almost done climbing!

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.100
This battle’s mine!

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.920
What’s with this?!

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.820
I didn’t plan on doing any flashy driving,

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:24.650
but I can’t back down if my opponent’s putting up a fight.

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:28.040
This race is already beyond reason.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:43.540
My tires…

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.040
Goddamn it… They’re expanding on their own!

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:07.460 line:50 %
Takumi's opponent is a one-hand steering
master. Toshiya Joujima, who is known as God Hand.
Joujima was interested by the fact that Takumi drives
an 86 and feels a sense of affinity when he hears that
it was what Takumi's father drove. Ryosuke sees a
long race ahead and advises him to endure. Without
really understanding the words "watch the course and
try not to watch your opponent," the race starts with
Takumi in the lead.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.020
Three!

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.250
Two!

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.230
One!

01:10:19.230 --> 01:10:20.190
Go!

01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.080
This is tough.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.650
I’ve had about enough of this.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:52.010
I didn’t notice when I was leading, but his racing line’s different!

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:55.990
There are different ways to drive this course from what I considered the best line.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.850
His timing for taking the inside is sooner or later than I would take it.

01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:02.320
It differs from traditional theories.

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.570
Is this the right way to do it here?

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:09.810
If not, then there’s no explanation for his speed.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.090
This time, too!

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:46.370
His line changes with every corner.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.420
I don’t get it.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.920
Is this the way he drives to get his times?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.750
If this produces record times,
then I don’t even know why we have racing lines!

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.260
We’re starting the seventh round!

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:26.860
This is no joking matter.

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.400
I’m having to drive like hell,

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.660
and he hasn’t even gone full speed!

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.230
My tires have about had it!

01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:38.910
I don’t know what I should do.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:53.160
It was worth dragging the race out this long.

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:58.580
Driving behind the 86 for so long now, I can tell.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:02.770
I can win this smartly, utilizing the difference in our tires.

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:06.500
I don’t have a lot of wiggle room.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.760
My tires have about had it, too,

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.920
but I will win smart.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.100
That’s the way adults win.

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.660
There it is!

01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:59.760
There’s nothing to be ashamed of.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.580
It’s not that you’re unskilled at all.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:09.390
Rather, considering the 86’s abilities,
this was a miraculous fight you put up.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.420
Now, I better run.

01:14:12.890 --> 01:14:15.730
There’s no more need to save my tires.

01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:21.040
Don’t be fooled by his tricks.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.890
He’s trying to confuse your lines.

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.400
Don’t be fooled by his lines. Trust your own.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.860
It couldn’t be!

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.820
I haven’t widened the gap at all.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.180
This isn’t possible.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:02.120
What is he doing?

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.600
He disappeared?!

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.000
Nonsense!

01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:52.410
How was that possible?

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:28.850 line:50 %
After completing the battle with Purple Shadow,
Takumi rode along with God Hand Jyojima at Ryosuke's
request and acknowledged that there were many more
problems he had to overcome. Project D has conquered
Gunma, Tochigi, Saitama, and Ibaraki. As they move on
toward the next stage to dominate Kansai, Project D's
battles still continue...
