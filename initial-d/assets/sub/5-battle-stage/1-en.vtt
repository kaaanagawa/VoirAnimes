00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.610
Takumi Fujiwara has been forced by his father, Bunta, to deliver
tofu every morning since Takumi's first year of junior high school.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.720
Though he reluctantly began driving at this early age, without
even realizing it he gained miraculous driving technique each day.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.450
Then one day, while descending Mt. Akina upon
completing his morning deliveries, Keisuke Takahashi
of the Akagi RedSuns appeared before him.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.890
Finally caught up, huh?

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.330
That's not from our team...

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.100
An MR2? A 180?

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.340
So you're pretty good, huh?

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.080
After two corners...

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.580
...you'll disappear from my rearview mirror!

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.120
It's an 86!?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.560
Don't screw with me!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.490
My FD can't outrun an old 86!?

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.490
Am I having a nightmare?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.290
I'm the Akagi RedSuns number two!

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.130
Doesn't he know what's ahead?

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.600
After this slow right, there's a sharp left.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340
If you don't slow down, you'll go right into the ravine!

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.570
I warned you!

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.210
You're going too fast!

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880
There isn't any more space to slow down!

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.420
What!?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.190
An Inertial Drift?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.070
I can't believe it...

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.470
Did I see the ghost of a racer who died on this pass?

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
Aiming to be the fastest team in Gunma,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
the RedSuns challenge the Akina SpeedStars.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
Knowing that the 86 is driven by

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
Takumi Fujiwara,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
a shocked gallery looks on

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.180 line:50 %
as the battle for revenge begins.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.430
Go!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.680
I'm not going to hold back!

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.580
Pulling ahead in the'straights is low...

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.590
...but this is a time attack.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.320
That 86 isn't going to be in my rearview mirror again!

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.320
What!?

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.830
The gap is shortening?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.730
His car's getting closer?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.900
It's just my imagination...

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.830
No way could something that impossible happen.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.480
He caught up!?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.320
What's happening?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.790
I feel like I'm going insane!

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.790
To be caught by a less powerful car...

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.590
...is the biggest disgrace for a racer!

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.190
Shit!

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.090
Shit...

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.820
What's wrong?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.820
Today of all days, the FD feels awfully slow!

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.590
Has the'secondary turbine stopped spooling!?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.570
It's a hairpin turn and he's not slowing down?

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.740
What's he thinking!?

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.380
What was that, just now?

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.200 line:50 %
The racer who watched the battle was

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.200 line:50 %
Myogi Night Kids, Takeshi Nakazato.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.200 line:50 %
Believing in the power of grip driving,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.200 line:50 %
he challenges drifter Takumi and his 86

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.200 line:50 %
to a battle.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.950
Can you keep up with my 'R'!?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.590
With that'showy crab-like drift...

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.830
...there's no way you can keep up with me!

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.570
When you look at it from up close...

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.340
...it's like art, isn't it?

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.770
A full-throttle four-wheel drift with almost no countersteer.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.480
I'm really impressed.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.820
This is it. This is the feeling!

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.620
This high tension, it's like my blood is boiling!

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.890
Now this is a battle!

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.290
I'm going to go all-out to the end!

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.090
How long can you keep up!?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.270
The 86 is going to pass.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.110
You say he's going to pass...

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.210
...but if he's being blocked like that...

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.640
...how can he?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.450
What? From the outside!?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.890
Don't underestimate me!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:39.890
You can't pass from the outside!

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.200
Because I'm blocking the inside so much,
my line is affected; the entry is slower!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.140
Okay! The inside is mine!

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.050
The 86 disappeared!?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.890
He couldn't be...

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.900 line:50 %
Takeshi's defeat pleases Shingo Shoji.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.900 line:50 %
Aiming to be the Night Kids fastest driver,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.900 line:50 %
and to defeat the 86 no matter what,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.900 line:50 %
he uses an FF-favored

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.900 line:50 %
"Duct Tape Deathmatch" to his advantage.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.400
Aren't we energetic?

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.900
But aren't you forgetting something?

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.770
Told ya...

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.590
Lucky!

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.800
I get it!

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.800
I've gotten the hang of this battle!

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.400
If I turn the wheel as little as possible, is it faster?

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.870
What's with that bastard?

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.380
He barely countersteered and cleared that corner.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.880
But I'm not as weak as Takeshi!

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.180
Winning is winning, no matter how I do it!

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.520
That had to be a fluke.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.190
I'm pissed!

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.260
He did that on purpose!

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.430
To scum like him...

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.190
...I absolutely won't lose!

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.780
Are you serious!?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.520
The 86 is closing the gap!

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.620
That's impossible!

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.540
Do you think you'll make me give up the inside!?

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.140
No way!

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.170
Could he be bumping me like I did before?

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.740
Damn it!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.320
I was passed...

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.720
I don't get this!

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.100
If I lose like this I'll be the laughingstock of the team.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.100
But if I can bring home a tie...

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.900
...I'll maintain my honor.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.170
Let's have this battle end...

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.670
...with a double crash!

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.610 line:50 %
Mako and Sayuki are Usui's fastest in their Sileighty.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.610 line:50 %
Since Mako has decided to retire as a racer,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.610 line:50 %
to battle the 86 as her last racing memory.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.610 line:50 %
So Takumi heads to Usui's pass

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:58.610 line:50 %
for his very first away battle.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.530
They're fast!

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.540
This is really dangerous.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.080
Can I do this too?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.690
He's pretty good, isn't he?

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.860
If he weren't, this wouldn't be any fun!

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.390
Mako!

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.730
We're almost to C=121, all right?

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.430
Start racing as best you can!

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.000
Someone who can enter as fast as I do...

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.370
...and clear it has yet to appear!

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.970
No oncoming traffic!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.810
Make it flashy, Mako!

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.810
Okay!

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.770
Go!

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.160
Th-that's impossible!

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.140
I've finally awakened.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.870
If I'm so mindful of his presence and keep looking back...

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:38.840
...I'll never be able to drive fast!

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.880
I won't look into the rearview mirror any more!

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.890
There aren't many remaining corners.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.190
But until the end I'll make no mistakes.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.190
I'll attack, attack and attack again!

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.690
I'll leave behind my regrets.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.530
As the fastest on Usui pass...

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.530
...I'll risk my pride!

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.650
If you don't lose him here...

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.480
...there's no place left to do it!

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.380
I know.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.190
The 86 isn't following.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.130
Why?

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.430
Not good, Mako! You went in too fast!

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
Akagi's White Comet, Ryosuke Takahashi

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
sends out a challenge to Takumi.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
However, Takumi can't decide what to do.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
Later at Myogi Pass,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
the battle of the Night Kids and Red Suns

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:17.870 line:50 %
has just begun.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.520
Starting the countdown!

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.070
5!

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.180
4!

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.290
3!

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.380
2!

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.460
1!

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.900
Go!

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:11.890
He's tough!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.830
The FD is fast in the corners.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.830
On Myogi's uphill...

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.000
...I didn't think anyone could keep up with my 'R'.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.910
His steering started to get aggressive.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:27.680
Is he increasing his pace to pull away?

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.280
If he tried that on the downhill...

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.680
...his tires would undoubtably wear out.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.690
It'started raining...

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.720
And the goal's so close!

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.660
When it just starts to rain is the most frightening.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:44.890
Make a move and without warning...

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.290
...you suddenly lose control.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.640
Let's go, bring it on!

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.240
That's reckless!

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.910
You can't go in at that'speed!

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.550
That idiot is going to go right into the wall!

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.480 line:50 %
The hill climb was interrupted by rain.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.480 line:50 %
However, rain racing specialist

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.480 line:50 %
Kenta Nakamura of the Red Suns

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.480 line:50 %
gains the gallery's interest by

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:39.480 line:50 %
challenging Takumi to a downhill race.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.200
There's absolutely no way I'll let you catch up.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.900
I'll steadily widen the margin!

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.380
Is this the'speed of someone who
was just daydreaming about a girl?

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:36.770
I'm in my element!

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.870
Tonight I'm in perfect form!

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:42.380
Akina's 86's undefeatable streak ends today!

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.880
I will defeat the 86!

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.150
What!?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.120
That's impossible...

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.890
To think that I...

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.190
...could this quickly...

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.730
...be caught on the downhill in the rain...

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.200
No.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.330
It's not like I've lost yet!

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.570 line:50 %
Having experienced many battles this summer,

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.570 line:50 %
Takumi has awakened to racing.

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.570 line:50 %
Finally, he departs to battle Ryosuke.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.790
I'm astonished...

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.630
The 86's movements are completely different from before.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.730
When he'stabilizes the drift...

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.730
...the minimal countersteer is the'same as before, but...

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.170
...the countersteer immediately
following the turn-in is getting smaller.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.880
He's evolving!

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.780
It's no good! I can't shake him!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.220
That's too fast! You messed up...

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.160
Shit!

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.100
Turn!

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.880
What a reckless guy...

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:29.880
If he had a high-powered car...

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.650
...he could power-over to pull in the nose...

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.180
...but to think he did it in an 86...

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.130
I thought I'd be left behind if I got passed, but...

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.800
...surprisingly the gap isn't widening!

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.430
I still have a chance!

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.880
My tires are a little worn out...

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.640
...but it won't affect my technique.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.780
Should I try that?

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.180
What dad was talking about before...

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.620
...the other kind of gutter run!

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.620
Okay...

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.160
Go!

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.670
What the hell did he do!?

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.880
There they are!

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.480
The FC is ahead!

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.750
Inside?

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.120
Outside?

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.620
From the outside!?

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.170
The FC is sliding outward!

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.600
Is he'serious!?

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.870
Even though the exit is much tighter...

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.770
...he went in so fast!

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.140
Their lines are going to cross!

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
Since Ryosuke's undefeated streak

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
had been broken by Takumi,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
the infuriated Emperors decided to

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
challenge the 86 to a battle.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
Though everyone said he couldn't win,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
Takumi said he didn't want

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.470 line:50 %
to run away.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:03.900
I'll show you...

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:05.200
...my power!

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.180
Look! From here on it'll be a high-tension full-throttle race.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.180
I'll erase you from my rearview mirror!

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.030
He's fast!

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.930
What a fast car that is!

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.640
Should I do it? The gutter run?

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.150
What?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.090
He's closing the distance between us?

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.620
That's impossible!

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.170
This is a complete disgrace!

00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:21.640
I can't shake an 86?

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:24.750
I hadn't thought that the 86 could be this fast.

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.850
He's deep, this downhill guy...

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.730
Even with the gutter run's speed I'm being left behind.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.200
There's no choice. Gutter run, part two...

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.770
Focusing on acceleration!

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.070
Here!

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.280
I won. There's nothing left!

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.750
Wh-what the hell is that!?

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.390
He's got the inside...

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.890
That's just an old, cheap piece of junk!

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.890
So what the hell is that'speed!?

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
Takumi is unsatisfied with winning on Akina.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
Since Sudo Kyoichi of team Emperor

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
called him out to Akagi,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
and since he learned Natsuki's secret,

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
he was overcome with anger and sadness

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:23.940 line:50 %
and headed for Akagi.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.390
You had better watch, Ryosuke...

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.700
...for this battle is also a challenge from me to you.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.000
He's right on my tail.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.740
It's like I'm being hunted down.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.610
That 86 is amazing!

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.980
He barely missed the guardrail buried by those bushes!

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.910
Shall we quit playing around?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.450
I'll end this here.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.990
You won't be able to escape my counterattack.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.890
He's taking the corner from the outside.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:20.100
The 86 is going to be overtaken!

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:31.570
Not yet...

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.410
I can't lose yet!

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.380
I'm not losing him.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.680
He's keeping a fixed distance between us.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.850
I'm surprised!

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.320
He's increased his pace after being overtaken.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.060
That's quite an accomplishment...

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.920
...with such a piece of junk.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.290
If you think about the acceleration
difference between an Evo and an 86...

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.360
...he's cornering faster than I am.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.870
Even though I'm trying so hard to catch up in the corners...

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.070
...he easily pulls away on the full-throttle straightaways.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.840
Is this the difference in power?

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.380
This is it.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:16.520
From here I'll drive with full confidence!

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.350
It'll be over in an instant.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.730
His driving style changed?

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:31.830
He's too fast!

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.570
He's pulling away!

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.870
Can I not catch up to him?

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.940
No matter what?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
Takumi's precious,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
beloved 86's engine is blown.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
He blames himself incessantly for it.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
"There's a huge, gaping hole inside my heart..."

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
The next day, the long-awaited battle between

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:14.440 line:50 %
The RedSuns and team Emperor has begun.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.910
It's over.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:29.650
He got the inside.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.520
There's nothing you can do.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.820
This will decide it.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.960
Shit!

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.800
You bastard!

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.870
You won't have another chance to pass.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.640 line:50 %
Following this race is a heroic battle in which

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.640 line:50 %
a miraculous course record concludes the'story.

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.080 line:50 %
Amidst the'strangely high tension,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.080 line:50 %
burning with revenge,

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.080 line:50 %
the Emperor's ace, Kyoichi, and the

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.080 line:50 %
RedSun's ace, Ryosuke, finally

00:31:54.410 --> 00:32:01.080 line:50 %
begin their downhill race.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.800
I haven't forgotten, Ryosuke.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.640
You probably already know...

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.880
...that for this battle...

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.110
...we're gambling all our faith on our techniques.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.090
It'starts here...

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.000
...the progress I've attained from my
misfiring system and all-wheel drive!

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.770
I'll show you, Ryosuke...

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.810
...the results from my past year of racing practice!

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.410
His fighting strength is terrifying.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.780
To be shown his serious racing ability...

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.650
...is truly astonishing.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.220
Try attacking from any angle you can, Ryosuke.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.460
My tires are still strong and clinging to the road tightly.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.200
You've perfected a nice car, Kyoichi.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:26.440
When you accelerate in a low gear, I get left behind.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.540
But if it's a high speed corner, I have
a chance to take advantage of you.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.680
It's strange that he's not trying to attack.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.320
Has he forfeited?

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:43.890
Hahaha, there's no way.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.720
He's definitely going to try to soon.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:02.470
Kyoichi, your weakness is that you haven't
conquered your fear of right turns.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.070
To put it bluntly...

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.780
...you suck at making right turns!

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.080
What!?

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.550
Ohh! The FC is attacking from the outside!

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.420
Amazing!

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.420
The Evo III is stuck and can't get in front!

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:20.820
Shit!

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.860
Even with my all-wheel drive and misfiring system...

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.760
...I can't fully use the engine's power!

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:36.870
He did it!

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:38.140
He made a comeback!

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:45.010
We won!

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
Unable to overcome the new

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
engine, Takumi finds Saitama's

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
fastest, Wataru Akiyama, before him.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
Even with his race-prepped engine,

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
Takumi feels distant, spurring Wataru

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:55.490 line:50 %
to challenge him.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.600
I'll watch closely from behind...

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.870
...this Gunma racer who is said to have never lost a battle.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:16.510
This is really hard!

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.180
What kind of place is this!?

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.230
What is this?

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.200
Are my senses deceiving me?

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.310
It was so hard to control until yesterday...

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.070
I can control this.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.010
I can drive my way!

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.180
This isn't the'speed of a racer who's
driving this course for the first time.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.290
My whole body's going numb!

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.390
This guy is amazing!

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.150
The 86 is finally listening to me.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.920
I want to win...

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.460
...I've never wanted to win so much.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:38.360
No matter what, I definitely want to win with this car!

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.200
I get the feeling that as conditions become
worse, his driving inversely gets better...

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.800
But after all, he's human too.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.370
The first to lose concentration loses the battle.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.470
This is a contest of endurance!

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:18.630
I've gotten pretty exhausted.

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.670
But he must feel the'same way.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.780
Even if he's slightly faster than I am, there's
no way he could pass me on this road.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.580
The only way to lose is to be left behind.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.820
What!?

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.690
There's more room on the bank than before!

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.000
Don't do anything stupid!

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.700
You can't pass on this course!

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.420
What a guy...

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.140 line:50 %
Ryosuke invited Takumi onto his new racing team,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.140 line:50 %
but Takumi couldn't reply immediately.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.140 line:50 %
So in order to test his newly reborn 86,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:27.140 line:50 %
Takumi heads to Kyoichi's home course for a battle.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.130
I see...

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.060
...so it's a little faster than before.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.370
As opposed to a turbocharged engine,
it has unique NA acceleration.

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.500
But no matter how much he's tuned the car...

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.070
...it's still an 86.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.940
I have 350 horsepower!

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.040
No matter what car comes, I won't lose here.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.780
Just like Ryosuke is the king of Akagi...

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.520
...I'm the Emperor here.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.220
I won't let my prey escape!

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.630
He's right on my tail.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:59.390
Anyway, I have no choice but to do my best.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.500
This downhill section will end soon.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.700
The 86's lead will end there too.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.300
There's no way he can escape my counterattack.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:14.440
A bridge!?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.350
Is the goal close!?

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.650
The'steep downhill section ends here.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.420
From here on you need real power.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:26.560
I'll show you how to win, Kyoichi Sudou style!

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.660
An illusion here makes the road look narrow...

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.830
...so you can't claim the outside line.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.600
If I just stick my nose in a little bit...

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.470
The third bridge!

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.080
The inner and outer lines cross on the bridge.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.310
For me it's the'same finish as always.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.380
I see it!

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.880
Go!

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:53.680
What!?

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.220
Fool, do you want to kill yourself!?

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:57.390
You're going too fast! You can't turn!

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:58.550
I can turn!

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.890
Turn for me, my 86!

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.400
Can I'make it!?

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:21.970 line:50 %
Kyoichi had been Kai Kogashiwa's target, so Kai

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:21.970 line:50 %
decided to defeat Takumi instead.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:21.970 line:50 %
It turns out, Kai's father and Bunta used

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:21.970 line:50 %
to be the fiercest of rivals.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:37.690
Go!

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.600
He's fast!

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.970
That is definitely no ordinary 86.

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.400
This is perfect...

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.770
...just what I was wishing for.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:55.610
I'm going to show this fast 86 how to pass from behind!

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.200
There's an awful lot of leaves on the ground...

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.100
...and to make matters worse, It's windy too.

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.200
If I'm not careful, I'may gain too much speed.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.070
This is tough...

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.570
Instead of sliding like this, should I
make the car slide from this angle?

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:27.240
This is difficult.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.680
A half-hearted trick alone won't be enough...

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.250
...what's important is the time and place that I do it.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.380
I'm getting a bad feeling about this...

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.190
...he's going to try some kind of trick!

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.890
Right here!

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.550
Now that I'm in front, you have no chance!

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.720
I won this battle!

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.900
If it continues like this, the distance
between us is only going to grow.

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:30.910
Go!

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.760
What a guy!

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.030
He cleared the jump on his first try!

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960
He's like a bundle of mountain pass-tuned senses!

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.290
By looking at the bushes on the'side of the road...

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.920
...I can see the how deep the gutter is!

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:24.630
This is it...

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:25.730
...my last chance!

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:32.830
What!?

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.840
What's this acceleration!?

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.810
What the hell did he do?

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.480
You bastard!

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.280
Here they come!

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.150
Who's in front?

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:49.450
They re neck-and-neck!

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.590
If their lines change at all, they'll both crash into the concrete wall!

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
With graduation in mind, Natsuki is eager to

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
make up with Takumi.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
Around that time, her previous boyfriend Miki

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
takes Natsuki on a drive in his car.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
Natsuki, seeking help, decides to call

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:37.030 line:50 %
Takumi, who rushes to Mount Akina.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.180
Yes, hello?

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:52.610
Help me, Takumi-kun! The lake...

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.420
Hello?

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.690
Mogi?

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.420
Hello!?

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.390
Where are we going?

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.460
Just wait.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.700
Until I'm satisfied, I'm definitely not giving you back.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:05.790
Takumi-kun!

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.260
You're kidding, right?

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.070
Takumi-kun came...

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.740
...for me!

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.080
I was wondering what kind of car he
drove, and it's just a piece of junk!

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:57.770
After three more curves, his car will
be so far away we won't even see...

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.470
What?

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.580
That's impossible!

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.850
There's no way!

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.620
My all-wheel drive is losing to that FR piece of junk!?

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.690
If you don't watch the road you're going to crash!

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.130
How about this!?

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.400
That's no good.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:24.070
It won't turn!

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.140
Please, don't hit me!

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.520
Takumi-Kun!

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.860 line:50 %
Takumi asks Ryosuke to battle him.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.860 line:50 %
By racing Ryosuke on his home course

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.860 line:50 %
he hopes to find the answer

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.860 line:50 %
to whether or not he'should join the new team...

00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:04.640
A battle with me?

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.510
Yes.

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:07.880
Please.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.280
I think I'll find the answer I'm looking for.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.480
Alright then, let's start!

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:13.920
Go!

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.860
I understand Fujiwara's feelings so well it almost hurts.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:33.570
Right now you must be concentrating
only on racing intently to your limit.

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.110
I'll have you show me...

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.740
...your racing techique.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.480
Amazing!

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.290
It's so amazing I'm going numb!

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.920
The FC and 86 are both amazing!

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.860
I can feel his racing aura!

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.400
Just as I thought, he's amazing!

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.570
Akina's pro is progressing at an incomparable rate!

00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:17.750
The result of this battle doesn't matter...

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.450
...as long as they both race seriously, that's enough.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.950
I'm really envious...

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:27.060
...that they can race together so seriously.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.090
What a strange feeling...

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.030
...when I'm racing with you...

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:36.670
...I see new holes in my technique
that I thought were already perfect.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:41.040
I never thought I'd have this much fun in a battle.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:43.870
I feel so free.

00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:46.270
I should follow in the footsteps of this person!

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.720 line:50 %
Takumi decides to join the ranks of Project D.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.720 line:50 %
From now on, Takumi, who has shown progress

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.720 line:50 %
which impressed even Ryosuke, will be involved in...

00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:55.320
Dedicated to Initial D World

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.820
Presented by OMFG

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
I did my best to keep subs close to the original

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
version. Unfortunately I had to make at least a

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
few edits and additions because this was a hard

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
sub extraction from an old avi file. They were

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
mostly positioning and coloring changes, along

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.590 line:50 %
with a couple timing adjustments.
