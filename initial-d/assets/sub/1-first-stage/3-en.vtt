Last night, he hit a guardrail
while coming down Akina.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.850
Was he hurt?

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.550
Not too badly...

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.420
It's only minor whiplash...

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.360
...but he's really upset about the whole thing.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.190
I heard his car is pretty messed up.

I came to ask you a favor
about that, Mr. Fujiwara.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.680
--A favor?
--Yes.

Don't die.

Mr. Fujiwara, I'm sure you
know how a street racer feels.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.530
I can't let the local drivers lose.

like me went out there,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.440

I grew up racing on Akina.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.710
Those Akagi Red Suns obviously
are making fools of Akina's drivers.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.410
I can't stand it!

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.580
I want to show them that Akina
has a street racer with true skill!

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.390
Mr. Fujiwara, you are the one who can do it!

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.720

fastest, the Takahashi Brothers.

How cheeky. You want me to put
high octane in that Eight-Six?

It must have been you, Yuichi.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.190
You told the weird rumor to that kid, Iketani.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.690
Sure. It wasn't a lie either.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.330
So what about it?

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.660
He came again today,

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.230
with a bandage on his head and a neck brace.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.000
He asked me to drive in his place.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Well, I can't say that I hate that kind of guy.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.710
If you don't hate him,
then why don't you do it?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.080
Iketani is a good guy.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.550
No, thanks.

nose into these kiddie fights.

That's not my style.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.320
So then it's all right if a kid
shows up at a kiddie fight, right?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.220
Are you talking about Takumi?

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.560
That's right.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.660
He's gotten pretty good, right?

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.630
He still has a ways to go...

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.170
If it's Akina's downhill,
he wouldn't lose to anybody.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.500
Well, except me, of course.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.710
Your competitive spirit is showing.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.040
I wonder where he got his
stubborn nature from...

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.050
But even if I order him to go race,
that won't make him want to.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.020
Well, because of those
bandages on Iketani's head,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.350
I'll try to think of a good strategy.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.840
A promise should never be broken.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.010
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.840
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.580
I want to use the car this Sunday.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.980
Sunday... you can't.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.480
Why not?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.050
I'll take care of the morning delivery.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.820
That's not the problem.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.560
I need to use it to go to
a town meeting on Sunday.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.660
Really? This is bad...

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.160
I really need the car on Sunday.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.840
It must be a girl.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.410
None of your business.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.840
Quit being so stubborn. Just let me use it.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.180
It's just a crappy old car...

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.050
I'll take it if I want to.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.510
A car won't move without a key.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.180
I'll put it on a string and
wear it around my neck.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.320
Not fair!

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.220
If you really want it that bad,
I'll think about it.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.360
Really?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.530
But there is a condition.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.200
Condition?

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.200
Saturday night, go meet some brat
who's known as the fastest on Akagi

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.370
and beat the pants off him

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.370
on Mt. Akina's downhill.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.040
What?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.710
If you do that, you can use
the car with no conditions,

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.110
and you'll get a full tank of gas.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.100
Full tank of gas?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.380

Keisuke, good timing.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.190
I wanted to ask you something.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.190
What is it, brother?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.900
The Eight-Six that you saw on Akina...

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.030
Can you describe the speed of the car,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.200
theoretically speaking?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.800
Oh, gimme a break.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.170
Unlike you, I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.810
Like I always say,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.980
the most important part
of driving technique is here.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.510
Whenever you battle somebody,

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.120
you can stay behind them and
learn whatever you want to know.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.490
From your opponent's habits and weaknesses

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.890
to how well their suspension is set up.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.390
Your ability to analyze is almost scary.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.360
In my opinion, the fact that
you can drive without thinking

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.030
and still keep up with me

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.500
means that you're the one who's truly scary.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.700
If you could apply theories to your skill,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.840
you'd be the ideal driver.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.910
I lost because I didn't know
the road and I was careless.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.810
I've never been disgraced like this before.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.910
The inside of that Eight-Six must be a monster.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.020
A monster, you say?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.180
This is getting more interesting...

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.910
Tomorrow is the meet.
Maybe I should go and watch.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.930
Takumi!

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.200
Saturday has arrived!

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.930
What about it?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.540
What do you mean,
"What about it?"Today is the meet!

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.250
The meet with the Akagi Red Suns!

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.520
You promised that you'd borrow the
Eight-Six and we'd go watch, right?

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.220
Sure. Speaking of which...

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.390
This is getting a bit complicated.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.290
What did you say?

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.700
You'd better not be trying to tell me
that you don't have the time...

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.770
No, that's not the reason...

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.230
If you back out at the last minute,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.900
you can kiss our friendship goodbye.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.970
Every day I've counted the days
on my fingers, waiting for today.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.780
I know.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.780
Excuse me!

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.780
Fried tofu, please.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.150
Oh, it's you again.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.280
You don't give up, do you...

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.550
Mr. Fujiwara, I beg you.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.490
At today's meet...

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.060
I might do it...

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.170
I might do it, that's what I said.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.570
On Akina tonight...

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.940
Honestly?!

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.610
Ouch... My neck...

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.010
Hey, are you okay?

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.280
Are you really going to come?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.080
I can't say for certain, but...

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.550
...I would say there's about a 50/50 chance.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.190
What time does it start?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.620
The gathering begins at eight o'clock,

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.620
but the time attack begins at ten.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.390
Ten o'clock...

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.900
If an Eight-Six hasn't shown up
by ten, you can give up on waiting.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.470
You'll have to do it on your own.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.640
I'll be waiting, Mr. Fujiwara.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.300
I have faith that you'll definitely come.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.470
It's not definite. I said it's 50%.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.710
No, you've already decided to come.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.580
Our team will be waiting for you!

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.180
Well, then, Mr. Fujiwara...

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.710
We'll be waiting for you on
the top of Akina at 10 o'clock.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.440
<i>I just can't be cold to an eager guy like him.</i>

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.670
<i>If Takumi won't do it, then should I go?</i>

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.270
<i>No, no, I shouldn't. I'm getting excited.</i>

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.970
Did something fun happen?

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.200
You seem different today.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.910
Really?

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.480
Aren't I always like this?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.750
You look happy about something.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.880
Actually, I'm going to the ocean
with my friend tomorrow.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.750
I'm really excited about it!

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.250
Friend? You mean a boy?

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.590
What? Of course not! I'm going with a girl!

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.330
I see. Well, let's go to the department store,

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.500
and I'll buy you a new bathing suit.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.930
It's okay. I already bought one on my own.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.070
I don't need two of them.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.170
I'd like to see you in your bathing suit.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.040
That's funny!

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.010
You've already seen everything.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:35.910
You're such a perv, Papa!

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.010
I wonder if tomorrow will be sunny.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.520
Don't ask me such a stupid thing.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.550
The weather is great all over Japan.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.120
Are you going somewhere?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.620
I'm going to the ocean.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.020
Ocean?

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.690
What?!

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.730
I'm jealous! I want to go to the ocean, too!

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.030
Could it be...?

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.300
You're going with a girl?! A girl?!

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.640
Sort of...

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.140
Who is it? Do I know her?

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.240
Is she cute? Does she have big ones?

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.140
She's very cute.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.910
Natsuki... Mogi...?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.320
Yeah.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.050
It's cruel of you not to tell me.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.320
Sorry, but the situation didn't
give me a chance to invite you.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.990
Next time, okay?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.930
Please don't cry.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.670
What's going to happen at today's battle?

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.370
I heard that the Red Suns have
won every battle they've been in.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.610
The outcome is already obvious.

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.080
Akina will be totally defeated.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.050
However, the fastest team in
Gunma is not the Red Suns...

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.680
It's us, the Myogi Night Kids.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.520
Takeshi, it's about time.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.680
Yeah, let's go.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.900
<i>It won't lose to Akagi's dumb rotaries.</i>

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.210
<i>Amazing.</i>

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.810

<i>Which side will win?</i>

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.700
<i>Takumi's Eight-Six is Bunta's Eight-Six.</i>

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.400
<i>It can't lose.</i>

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.560
<i>It's been a while since I've gotten this excited.</i>

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.510
Wow, so many people!

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.120
I've never seen such a huge crowd on Akina.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.620
The Red Suns brought them all
here to show off their speed.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:05.130
If we lose tonight, we'll be humiliated.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.130
By the way, the Eight-Six that
you were telling us about...

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.000
Is it for real, Iketani?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.570
Yes.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.670
I don't have any faith in that Eight-Six.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.840
I heard that Keisuke Takahashi's FD3S

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.210
is lightly tuned for mountain driving.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.040
But even still, there is a rumor
that it's putting out over 350 HP.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.350
The difference in power is too great.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.250
Even on the downhill, there's
no way an Eight-Six can compete!

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.720
Iketani, are you sure you
didn't hit your head too hard?

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.520
An Eight-Six is an Eight-Six,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.360
but this is not a normal Eight-Six.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.360
Keisuke Takahashi said it himself...

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.830
On the outside, it's a normal panda Trueno,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.370
but inside, it's a monster machine.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.840
Trust me.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.100
I'm sure he will come.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.340
If he doesn't come...?

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.950
There is a huge crowd here.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.480
I don't want them to say
the Speed Stars ran away.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.950
If he doesn't come...

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.690
If he doesn't come...?

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:11.360
Kenji, represent our team and drive like hell!

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.990
You must be joking.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.070
A bunch of cars are coming.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.500

Wow, the Takahashi Brothers are so popular.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.140

a big hospital in Takasaki.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.850
according to schedule.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:45.690
It should be easier since it's late
and there aren't many other cars.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.190
We'll use radios at the start and finish points

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.860
in order to time the runs.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.890
In order to allow the drivers to run
full-bore and as fast as they want,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:55.730
officials will be placed at the blind corners,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.700

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.400
we will use lights to signal the driver.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.700
I see.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.970
Seems like they've done this a lot.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.510
Yeah. They probably do
time attacks everywhere.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.280
Well, now that I've said that,

secret weapon until the last moment?

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.410
Sure, but I don't really want to.

During the drift,

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:07.860
if you lack the skill to freely
change your speed and line,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.560
