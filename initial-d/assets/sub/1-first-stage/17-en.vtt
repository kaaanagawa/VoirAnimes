<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.090
Please, Takumi!

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.800
I couldn't tell this to the others,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.830
but I knew I had to tell you
to make you understand.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.310
I don't like this. She makes me mad.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
Takumi, don't be angry at Mako.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.180
She's a good girl.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
I don't know why you have to defend her.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.120
I don't get it. You don't owe her anything.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.650
I'm begging you, Takumi.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.200
<i>Hey, Takumi?</i>

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.040
<i>You've never been to other passes, have you?</i>

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.540
<i>Could you race here?</i>

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.030
<i>I wouldn't know until I tried it.</i>

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.490
I'll race her.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.260
Really? I'd be so grateful!

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.730
I don't know what you and that
girl expect out of this, but...

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.330
Takumi...

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.770
I'll go to Usui with my Eight-Six.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.670 line:50 %
"Act 17: Sudden-Death Death Match"

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.850
Are you serious, Kenji?!

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.290
I can't believe Takumi decided to battle it out

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.450
with Usui's Sileighty!

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.460
Me, neither.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.030
It's not like him to go to
another pass and battle it out.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.900
How did Iketani talk him into it?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.700
I'm not really sure.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.210
Iketani doesn't want to talk about it in detail.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.140
We talked about what would happen

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.440
if Takumi raced at another pass, remember?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.910
Yeah.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.920
I can kind of understand Iketani
wanting to see that happen...

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.910
But he doesn't have to race
the Sileighty right off the bat.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.990
Is Takumi racing in Usui?

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.790
That's right, boss!

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.230
And the Sileighty is that good, huh?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.800
She's better than good!

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.140
She drifted left and right, and faked
some moves on that narrow road!

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.810
Takumi was there, too,

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.310
so he knows how good she is.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.310
He'll win, though!

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.480
I almost envy your simplicity.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.820
That attendant said that
no local had ever beaten her.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.660
Maybe this time,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.650
it's not about winning or losing for Takumi.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.140
I'm out of cigarettes.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.440
I guess I'll go for a little spin.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.480
What the...?!

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.890
My Eight-Six turned into an Eight-Five.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.690 line:50 %
"I borrowed the car.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.690 line:50 %

- Takumi"

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.240
Your dad must be freaking right about now!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.000
His Eight-Six turned into my Eight-Five.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.810
Iketani, I want to ask you something.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.150
What?

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.890
Which side are you on this time?

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.090
Which side?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.830
I just coordinated this race, that's all.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.390
Am I supposed to believe that?

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.500
What about Takumi?

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.170
Aren't you sacrificing your friend

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.540
to look good in front of Mako?

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.910
--That's not true.
--Oh, yeah?

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.350
Then do you really think
Takumi can win this race?

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.210
Do you? What's your answer?!

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.620
I, uh...

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.060
He has no chance.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.300
He only knows Akina Pass, and is racing

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.400
at difficult Usui Pass for the first time.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.070
I know his technique is incredible,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.410
but that's not the answer to everything, is it?

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.410
He's never even driven the pass!

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.120
Even Takumi can't handle a new
course without any practice.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.760
You must've realized that much.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.630
I, uh...

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.000
Men go crazy for women they like.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500
To make this summer memorable,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.170
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.680
But don't sell out your friend for a woman!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.350
Have you forgotten that Takumi and
his Eight-Six saved your ass once?

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.450
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is our pride.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.360
Let's stop this nonsense...

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.350
...or our friendship is over!

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.370
You're right, Kenji.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.220
I'm sorry.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.660
I should've come to you
with this a long time ago,

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.990
but I kept it to myself.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.690
I still don't get why you're quitting racing.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:57.540
It was so much fun when we
started racing two years ago.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.480
We've always wanted to
become the fastest here.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.520
It's still fun, though, isn't it?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.050
I can't explain it...

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.020
...but I'm just not as intense as before.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.190
I don't know why.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.600
I just feel like it's time to move on.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.740
I've done enough...

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.570
I don't know.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.740
I still don't get it.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.010
I want to have a boyfriend

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.620
and a normal relationship, like you do.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.050
You can race and still have a boyfriend.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.550
You can't.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.890
I don't think you can understand how I feel.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.730
You have someone you like, don't you?

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.390
I must confess that I've
had someone in mind...

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.590
I was just messing with you. I didn't know.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.760
You couldn't have known.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.900
He's not from here,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.470
and I was just admiring him from afar.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.300
Oh, my!

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.010
You must be the ultimate innocent, shy girl.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.470
And you're 20.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.140
I liked it that way.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.580
I was satisfied with just admiring him.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.120
You gotta learn to be more realistic than that.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.820
Sorry.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.830
But I do want to test what you and I
have built in the last two years...

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.160
...in this final race.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.530
You want a final exam.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.500
It sounds good to me.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.370
He's a perfect opponent for you.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.100
Yeah.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.210
But I'll tell you this...

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.040
As long as we race at Usui Pass,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.780
we have to win, no matter who we race.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.850
I can't accept anything less.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.990
I know.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.460
We have to win, no matter what.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.030
Even if it's against the Eight-Six.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.120
Absolutely.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.400
Well, there's no use racing if you're not into it.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.640
Iketani and I will let them know.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.200
You guys turn around here.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.880
Yeah, I'm sorry, Takumi.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.150
He means it, Takumi.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.490
Kenji, I'm not going back.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.520
Takumi...

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.030
I'm going because...

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:08.360
...I do want to race her.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.570
I'm not going back.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.260
Takumi...

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.240
But Takumi, you saw what Mako is capable of.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.380
She's too much for you.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.410
--Even you can't beat her.
--I know.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.380
This isn't about winning or losing.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.390
Don't say that!

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.060
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is famous now!

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.790
Have some pride.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.190
I'm not good at that sort of thing.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.960
I happened to win some local races,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.260
and the rumors exaggerated my abilities.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.140
I would feel better if
rumors like that went away.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.610
--Hey...
--Come on!

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.810
I'm going.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:02.110
I just want to attack this
new pass as well as I can.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.220
I should apologize for my harsh words earlier.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.300
How could we say anything
to him after that, really?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.160
Yeah.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.400
Well, he's one of a kind for sure.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.640
He's strange.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.910
It's hard to tell if he's special...

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.140
...or simply "off."

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.790
The tires look good.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.630
The pressure is ideal for this road.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.470
I don't think it's necessary
to make any more adjustments.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.940
If you say so, Sayuki.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.710
I know you know,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.140
but in this kind of race,
avoid wide-angle drifts.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:06.980
And it's crucial to know when
to drift and when not to drift,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.150
especially with Usui's continuous turns.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.320
I'm with you, so believe in
your technique and go for it.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.810
You won't lose to anyone!

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.660
I won't let you down.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.170
Together, we're one winning team.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.200
--Yeah.
--I'm fired up, Sayuki!

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.140
I've never felt this good before.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.810
<i>I'm excited to see how the race will turn out...</i>

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.210
<i>...and how good he really is.</i>

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.740
So, how are you gonna win this race, Takumi?

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.410
Do you have a plan? Tell me!

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.110
Not really.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.680
What?!

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.510
Can't you think of something?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.710
I refuse to see you lose.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.690
How about this?

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.360
Usui Pass is narrow
and has no straight lines...

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.630
...so jump the gun and get ahead!

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.870
What the...?

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:39.040
And you can block her the rest
of the way to the finish line!

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.040
I can't do that, 'cuz it's unfair.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.210
But if she gets ahead of you, it's over.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.380
That's true...

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.160
Man, we need to come up with a plan!

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.890
Her car has four wheels just like yours...

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.230
What?!

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:19.180
Are you really the driver of
the Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.150
Unbelievable.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.920
How old are you, anyway?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.920
I'm eighteen.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.090
Eighteen? A high school kid?
You've gotta be kidding me...

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.090
Twenty isn't much older than eighteen.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.830
And they're girls.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.990
Now we really can't lose to him, right, Mako?

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.440
Let's talk about the race.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.890
I don't think it's a good idea
to start side by side here,

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.390
because whoever has a better start

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.230
has a definite advantage.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:11.300
I'd hate to argue over who
cheated and jumped the gun.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.900
There goes my plan!

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.070
Then how?

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.210
How about a "cat and mouse" race?

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.410
It's a chase race.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.910
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.580
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.920
It's a "sudden-death death match."

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.990
--Well?
--That's fine.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.760
Since we're the locals here,

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:40.190
you get to choose whether you
want to be the cat or the mouse.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.430
--Well...
--Hold on a sec!

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.400
Come here, Takumi.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.740
With this rule, you should go in front first.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.070
It won't end with one race,

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.240
but at least you get one practice.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.180
It's better to lose in the second race.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.380
He'll go in front first.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.290
I'll win in the second race, then.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.460
I don't mean to ignore your good advice,

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:14.130
but I don't think I like that.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.930
What are you saying, Takumi?!

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.870
--I'll chase her first.
--What?!

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.440
--Wha...?!
--Think it over, Takumi!

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.440
This is my race, so let me decide.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.600
But...!

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.550
--I'll chase.
--What?

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.150
You'll chase?

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.280
Is he trying to insult us, or is he an idiot?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.720
It's okay. I'll smoke him!

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.500
Who is it? I'm busy.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.580
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.080
Hey, Bunta?

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.920
It's only you.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.180
I'm busy right now.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.820
I thought I should tell you
something about Takumi...

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.860
Should we start the race?

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.260
He went to Usui for a race? So?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.930
"So?" Is that all you can say?

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.870
Aren't you worried?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.110
Not really. He's my son, you know?

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.840
We'll go slowly, so just follow us.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.150
After the first turn, we'll go full speed.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.620
That's the beginning of the race.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.000
Is that all you have to say?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.540
That's all.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.030
I'm busy, so don't call me about nonsense.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.170
Hey, Bunta?!

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.050
I was an idiot, Takumi.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.220
I realize that now.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.390
I know...

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.530
...that the only reason you
agreed to try this losing race

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.930
was to save my ego.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.600
I'm regretting it now.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.770
You're Akina's racer.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.210
You're our pride.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.110
This is a huge mistake.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.850
I don't wanna see you lose
because of my stupidity.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.260
He won't lose, Iketani!

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.450
Reality isn't that simple, you know.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.130
It's my fault.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.890
Iketani...

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.070
Iketani...

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.800
I chose to be the cat for a reason.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.530
What?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.940
I'm not sure if I'll win,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.810
but I'm not here to lose.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.480
So, you do have a plan?

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.420
It's not really a plan...

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.820
More like an inspiration.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.290
--What is it, Takumi?
--Tell us!

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.160
No matter how fast she is,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.000
she can't fly.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.670
Yeah?

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:43.000
She's driving on four wheels, too.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.670
Four wheels...?

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.670
Then I should be able to turn these corners

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.680
as fast and as well as she can,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.310
don't you think?

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.850
You're right!

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.520
Theoretically, it's true.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.860
That's crazy talk!

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.760
We're going!

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.660
Let's go, Mako!

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.770
Let's finish him quickly!

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:17.100
Okay, Sayuki. I'll show you the best race ever!

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.350
Wow!

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.980
They're going full throttle already!

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.590
Takumi's first "away" race has finally started.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:11.360
Takumi is at a serious
disadvantage in this race, though.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.560
I'm not worried...

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.090
...because I know he'll win!

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.530
<i>Mako, we can't lose on our own turf!</i>

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.670
<i>--We're street racers!</i>
<i>--Yeah.</i>

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:36.070
<i>What will you do if Mako quits racing, Sayuki?</i>

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.570
<i>--I'll still be racing!</i>
<i>--Sayuki...</i>

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.640
<i>--So, you won't retire?</i>
<i>--I'll be racing after men!</i>

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.250
<i>--Huh?</i>
<i>--Where are all the good men?</i>

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.480
<i>Where are they...?</i>

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.850
<i>See ya, Sayuki.</i>

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.250
<i>Next on Initial D...</i>

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.590
<i>"Hot Winds &amp; Furious Driving!"</i>

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.750
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
