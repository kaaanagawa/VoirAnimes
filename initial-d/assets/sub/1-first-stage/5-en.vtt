<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.040
<i>He's caught up with me?!</i>

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.200
<i>What's happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.550
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.680
The two of them just passed!

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.650
He's on Keisuke's bumper!

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.920
Akina's Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.190
Keisuke's FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.730
Man, I've got goosebumps...

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670
Great attack!

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.070
That Eight-Six's attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.940
<i>My old man...</i>

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.280
<i>Unless I pass that car,</i>
<i>he won't admit that I won...</i>

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.450
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>I guess I have to do that...</i>

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.390
<i>A full tank of gas is riding on this...</i>

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.760
<i>The setup point is in the next</i>
<i>five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.590 line:50 %
"Act 5: Dogfight!"

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.480
<i>Damn!</i>

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.860
<i>What's going on? Of all days,</i>
<i>today the FD feels extremely slow!</i>

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.730
<i>Is the secondary turbine still working?</i>

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.700
This is the top of the mountain.
Can you hear me?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.340
Ryosuke?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.640
Pretty soon,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.140
the two will reach the five
consecutive hairpins up there.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.470
Give me the play-by-play.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.310
Tell me what's happening in
as much detail as possible.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.680
Okay. They're very close to us now.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.980
I can hear the sound of tires
squealing. They'll be here soon!

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.320
Here they come!
Keisuke's FD! And the Eight-Six!

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.190
They're neck and neck!

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.400
Wow! Great! That Eight-Six is amazing!

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400
It did a perfect braking-drift!

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.430
Keisuke is losing ground.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.240
His recovery is great, too!
It's so close to the guardrail!

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.610
They're going into the second
hairpin! There's no gap now!

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.280
Recovery is the same for both of them!

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.030
The FD got close to the outside!
The Eight-Six is...!

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.630
<i>The hairpin is coming!</i>
<i>But he's not slowing down!</i>

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.600
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.210
The Eight-Six is going into the
hairpin at an incredible speed!

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.400
Are his brakes out?!

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.710
What's that?!

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.390
Keisuke was passed! Easily on the inside!

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.330
That can't be true...

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.400
We don't understand
what's happening! Be exact!

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.400
But...we were watching it...

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.840
...and a car shouldn't be able to turn

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.010
at a speed exceeding the tire's grip, right?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.840
But that Eight-Six turned in a weird way.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.580
It was kind of like a roller coaster,
even though that line was

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.850
supposed to be bad on the inside turn.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.010
I have no idea what happened!

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.620
I know what the Eight-Six did.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.130
What?

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.630
It's a stupid thing, but no one can imitate it.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.870
And it can happen only here on Akina.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.030
I can't believe anyone would
try something so stupid.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.010
<i>I've got something to look forward to...</i>

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.150
<i>Akina's downhill specialist...</i>
<i>You will be beaten by...</i>

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.580
<i>...me, Takeshi Nakazato of the Myogi Night Kids!</i>

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.760
This is the finish line! I can
hear the sound of their engines!

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.520
They're almost here!

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.530
Here they come! Which one's in the lead?!

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.760
It's the Eight-Six!

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.760
Wow! What's going on?!

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.230
Keisuke's FD is coming, too!

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.070
But there is too much of
a gap for him to cover!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.090
The Eight-Six easily wins!

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.840
<i>Crap!</i>

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.540
<i>My FD beaten by an Eight-Six?!</i>

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.680
<i>That's impossible!</i>

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.770
<i>350 horses defeated by a shabby Eight-Six?!</i>

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.450
The Eight-Six just crossed the finish line!

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.120
Keisuke has lost!

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.960
We did it!

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.180
<i>Am I having a nightmare?</i>

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.480
<i>I lost to an Eight-Six?! Twice?!</i>

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.990
Wow! He won! That spacey Takumi!

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.190
Great! It's too cool! I'm totally numb.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.230
I feel like I'm going crazy.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.270
--He did it!
--Yeah!

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.370
Iketani! Don't cry! You idiot!

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.340
I don't know why... But I'm happy...

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.870
Let's take lessons from him...

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.980
Like drift control, and picking a line...

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.280
Let's put the Speed Stars' sticker
on it without him knowing!

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.450
Oh! I volunteer to do that! Iketani!

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.790
All right. I'll count on you...!

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.660
It was a clear loss.
Let's admit it with some grace.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.630
How about the timed run
for the uphill, Ryosuke?!

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.530
The uphill doesn't mean anything.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.300
By tomorrow, rumors will
spread among the street racers

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:33.240
that the undefeated Red Suns
lost to an Eight-Six from Akina...

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.980
We will have to get even soon...

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.170
...with my FC.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.250
A full tank of gas...

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.020
That's what you promised.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:58.520
You promised!

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.000
I see... He won...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.230
I knew he would win even
before the race began...

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.300
This right is where I was
passed by the Eight-Six.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.370
I just don't get it.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.700
How could the Eight-Six,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.440
which isn't good on inside corners,
go through it faster than my FD?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.740
Just remembering it gives me the creeps.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.080
He may be a real ghost...

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.490
Keisuke...

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.950
Tell me exactly what happened at that time.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.720
Was there anything strange?

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.660
Come to think of it, I heard a
strange sound. Like scraping!

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.690
A strange sound?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.540
I see... Now I understand.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.040
What?

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.440
Should I tell you why you lost?

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.730
He used this.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.030
--A drainage ditch?
--Yes.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:45.600
He dropped his inside tires
into the ditch on purpose

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.370
and resisted the centrifugal
force by hooking it.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.570
In that way, it is theoretically possible to gain

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.440
more cornering force than the tires can grip.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.720
It is too obvious and simple,
and it's a ridiculous idea.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.850
It wouldn't be successful
if he'd never done it before.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.420
I assume that he probably
practices like this regularly.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.550
He must have run Akina for many years.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.660
Damn!

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.870
The mountain downhill is fun

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.840
because this kind of thing happens.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.870
It's been a while

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.200
since I've met a target that
I can get excited about.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:31.510
Let's cancel the expedition
we were planning for next week.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.680
Until we have a complete victory
at Akina, we can't move on.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.020
I'll beat the Eight-Six!

"Green Shopping Street"

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.240
Bunta! Are you in?!

"Closed Today"

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.940
It's me!

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.410
Oh, it's hot.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.580
Oh, it's Yuichi...

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.340
Good timing!

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.180
I have a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.520
Sorry to bother you,
but can you give me a ride?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.850
What? Are you using me as a taxi?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.430
I heard Takumi was great...

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.760
Iketani and the others have been
excited about it all morning.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.030
It's not particularly great.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.340
I've heard that the expectations
of kids these days are pretty low.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.540
He doesn't like driving cars.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.740
Is that right? I can't believe it.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.210
He has such a great technique.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:44.350
To him, driving a car equals
helping with my business.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.350
I've forced him to do it
since he was in junior high,

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:50.720
so he can't imagine that driving is fun.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.390
I see...

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.730
He's somewhat cynical about it.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.430
But the chase on the
downhill of Akina last night

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.200
might have given him
something to feel passionate about.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.480
Speaking of which, I didn't see the Eight-Six...

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.240
Where is Takumi?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.910
I don't know what's going on,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.410
but he went somewhere
this morning in a good mood.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.950 line:50 %

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.480
Wow! It's cold!

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.150
Takumi, you're...

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.850
...a very good driver.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.590
Really?

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.820
To tell you the truth, I usually get carsick.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.090
So I brought medicine for it.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.670
But I didn't feel sick at all
when you were driving.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.930
This is the first time I didn't get sick

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.560
after being in the car for so long.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.710
Do you ride in cars that often?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:51.250
Oh... not that often...

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:56.950
Just when my family goes
out and my father drives...

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.990
<i>She is strange...</i>

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.560
<i>I was just driving like I usually do</i>

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.390
<i>so I don't spill the water in the paper cup.</i>

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.000
<i>It was strange yesterday...</i>

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.010
<i>The car running in front of me</i>
<i>was getting closer and closer,</i>

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.640
<i>and the next thing I knew...</i>

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.080
<i>...I found myself getting a</i>
<i>charge out of chasing it.</i>

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.070
<i>I've never thought driving was fun before...</i>

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.680
<i>Even today, when I was</i>
<i>driving with Mogi next to me,</i>

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.750
<i>it was a lot of fun.</i>

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.770
<i>Driving isn't that bad...</i>

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.450
Hey, Takumi.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.820
Hey! Hello!

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:10.460
You were daydreaming just now.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.890
Were you spacing out?

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.030
You're rude, Takumi.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.330
When a person has a cute girl with him,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.970
do you think he should be off
in his own little world? Really!

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.870
Sorry! What did you say?

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.900
I just asked if you have a girl you like.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.140
I don't have anyone in particular...

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.150
Although I do have someone I
can't help thinking of a little...

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.490
How about you?

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:47.190
I also have...

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.650
...someone I can't help thinking of a little.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.700
What are you saying? Don't be a copycat.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.310
Boy!

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.550
I don't know how many times

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.850
I was asked the same thing this morning.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.490
"Who was in that Eight-Six yesterday?"

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.790
I was asked many times, too.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.890
Anyway, he beat Keisuke Takahashi.

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.160
It's no surprise that people are talking.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.160
I got a little carried away...

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.170
I told everyone that the Eight-Six was

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.330
the secret weapon of the Speed Stars.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.170
We have to find a way to get
Takumi to join the Speed Stars.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.040
Otherwise, we'll be embarrassed later.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.340
Iketani! Leave it to me!

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.010
Because I'm his best friend,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.810
I'll make him do it.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.550
Are you sure, Itsuki?

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.350
Of course!

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.750
I know his weak points, too...

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.230
But in return, please let
me join the Speed Stars!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.360
If Takumi will join us, you're in. Right?

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.270
Yeah...

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.800
Lucky! The negotiation was successful!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.640
But how are you going to get a car?

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.640
I'm glad you asked!

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.640
I've already made up my mind!

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.780
Oh! You've finally saved up the money!

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:17.550
I'll ask my dad to sign for me
and get a loan for an Eight-Six!

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.290
Takumi has a Panda Trueno,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.990
so I'll look for a red or black Levin...

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.030
...and someday we'll be
called the Eight-Six Pair,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.360
the fastest in Akina.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.670
But, Itsuki...

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.470
...Takumi's Eight-Six is not a normal Eight-Six.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.710
That's right.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.580
It was faster than the FD
with 350 horsepower...

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.810
It must have incredible tuning.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.820
I'd like to take a peek under the hood.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.260
Instead of that, why don't you go along

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.230
when he goes for Akina's downhill record?

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:01.200
Wow! That's a good idea!

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.200
I want to ride, too!

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.930
We can go where no one has gone before!

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.000
--I can't even imagine it...
--Yeah...

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.540
I bet it's greater than any
extreme roller coaster.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.380
Yeah...

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.680
Crap! Right now, Takumi is...!

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.430 line:50 %
"Beach House"

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.560
Wait a minute! Takumi!

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.280
Excuse me! Could you take our picture?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.870
All right.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.050
What's this? We're going to take a photo?

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.950
We came all this way. It's for our memories.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.990
Smile! Smile!

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.890
Here we go.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.830
Excuse me! One more!
Please take one more picture!

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.190
That's enough...

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.250
Never mind, never mind!

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.460
Oh! That white FC!

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.520
That's Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.630
Finally, Red Suns' No. 1 showed up!

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.730
What for?

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.130
Must be revenge for his brother.

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.100
Can you think of anything else?

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.700
That was just yesterday!
He came here already?!

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.230
He must be really mad about being
beaten by the Eight-Six. I wonder...

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.040
That's an R32 I've never seen here.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.210
A black R32...

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.320
Something about it makes me shiver...

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.080
Who is that?

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.760
<i>Damn! You traitor, Takumi!</i>

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:32.830
<i>All of a sudden you're strolling in!</i>

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.400
<i>He went to the ocean with Mogi</i>
<i>and without me, his best friend!</i>

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.410
<i>You wanted to see Natsuki</i>
<i>in her swimsuit, didn't you?</i>

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.110
<i>Of course!</i>

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.210
<i>Takumi was alone with her.</i>

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:48.680
<i>He must have done something</i>
<i>with her! I'm sure of it!</i>

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.890
<i>Next time on Initial D!</i>
<i>A new battle is in the air...</i>

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.520
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
