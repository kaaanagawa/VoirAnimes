--Whew! I'm beat!
--Ooh... That was rough...

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.060
Why do we have to practice so hard?

--I'm starving. Let's get some pizza!
--Count me in!

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.870
For real? With Natsuki Mogi?

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.370
Now that is one fine babe.
Everyone wants a piece of that booty!

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.740
Yeah, well, she'll do whatever I tell her to.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.410
It's time I broke her in.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.910
What do you mean, "break her in"?

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.520
You know what he means!

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.820
Girls are all the same.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.550
They act like they don't want it at first,
but then they come around.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.220
The other day I called her up to the roof, and...

The little squirt doesn't know his place!

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.100
Cut it out, Takumi!

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.570
I've had enough of listening to you bastards!

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.740
Why, you little...!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.510

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.220
<i>I just asked if you have a girl you like.</i>

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.760
<i>I have someone I can't help thinking of a little.</i>

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.620
Iketani! Hey! Where'd Iketani go?

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.620
Iketani?

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.620
Oh, you mean Iketani, whose terrifying
screams echoed across Mt. Akina

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.400
as he rocketed down the dangerous
three-corner road and passed out!

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.270
That Iketani just left on a delivery.
He took the pickup truck.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.500
Oh... If Iketani's not here,
then maybe you can help, Takumi.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.040
Could you deliver some papers
to the Yamada shop for me?

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.740
You can take my car.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.800
Uh, sure.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.480
Hey, boss. Um...

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.220
You know, I have a license, too.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.690
Why do you always ask Iketani
and Takumi to run errands?

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.560
Well, you see... put your hand on
your chest and tell me what you feel.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.060
--Now do you understand?
--No...

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.100
Simply put, I can trust
Iketani and Takumi to drive.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.440
As for you, though...

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.240
...you'd bring my car back with a
dent the size of your caved-in chest.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.580
Well, there you have it.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.910
<i>You just wait and see.</i>

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.110
<i>Once I get my own Eight-Six,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be the fastest racer around...</i>

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.920
<i>Whoa, an R32!</i>

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.020
Welcome, sir!

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.760
<i>What a ride! The R32's the bomb!</i>

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.890
<i>N-Night Kids!</i>

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.240
Hey, kid. My name's Nakazato.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.310
Someone back on my turf
told me I could contact

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.710
a member of the Speed Stars at this station.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.990
Tell me this. When can I find
that Eight-Six at Akina?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.660
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.390
Aren't you a member of the Speed Stars?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.170
<i>Me... a member of the Speed Stars... Cool...</i>

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.700
I guess I came to the wrong place.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.940
Wait! No, you're at the right place!

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.080
Actually, that Eight-Six guy and me,
we're down like brothers.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.510
What?!

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.380
Yeah, people call us the Eight-Six Duo.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.350
We're the fastest down-hillers on our team.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.350
Really?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.020
Yeah, well... actually, he may be
a bit faster than me, but still...

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.490
I didn't know anyone on the
Speed Stars could race at that level...

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.700
Yeah, um... Well, never mind that.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.970
Say, I can deliver him a message if you want.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.340
After all, he's my bro.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.680
All right. Tell him this.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.340
10 o'clock this Saturday night.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.910
10 o'clock this Saturday night...?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.990
Nakazato of the Night Kids will be
waiting for him on top of Mt. Akina.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.760
Waiting on top of Mt. Akina... What?!

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.990
It'll be a race to the bottom!

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.430
Wait! That's a... Hey!

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.860
Uh, you know... Wait a second, please!

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.160
Hey, wai...

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.200
<i>Oh, now I've really done it!</i>

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.600
<i>Did he just challenge Takumi?</i>

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.410
Oh, no! What am I going to tell Takumi?!

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.580
Takumi!

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.950
What are you all panicked about?

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.380
Never mind that.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.120
Say, if you're free this Saturday,
you want to go racing at Mt. Akina?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.290
--No.
--Why not?

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.900
Sorry, but I don't drive a car
unless it's absolutely necessary.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.200
Takumi!

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.640
Thanks a lot. Come on in and have some coffee.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.540
Okay.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.010
Hey!

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.710
Not good. This is not good.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.250
See you tomorrow.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.020
Hey, Takumi.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.880
Let me ask you something.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:42.720
Suppose--just suppose--a racer
were to challenge you to a race.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.030
You'd accept, of course, right?

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.500
No way. I'm not into that scene.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.570
What?! Don't say that!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.230
What's it matter to you?

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.340
Um... well... uh... That's beside the point.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.210
You know, if a racer receives a challenge,

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.880
he has to stand up and accept it!

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.010
Well, that may be true for a racer.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.950
But I'm no racer.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.350
No racer?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.880
Besides, being forced to accept
challenges just isn't my thing.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.830
<i>Not good. This is definitely not good...</i>

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.960
What'll I do?

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.420
<i>Only two more days to go.</i>

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.650
<i>Eight-Six, Ryosuke Takahashi,</i>
<i>your days are numbered.</i>

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.990
<i>I'll show you who's number one!</i>

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.370
Iketani!

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.170
You accepted a challenge from
the Night Kids of Mt. Myogi?!

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.540
Why were you keeping something
that big a secret from us?!

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.180
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.980
It's no use trying to deny it.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.550
The word's out all over town.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.790
Eight-Six and R32 going at it on the downhill!

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.190
Eight-Six? That's news to me!

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:26.190
What?! The word is, Nakazato came
to this gas station in person

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.860
to issue the challenge!

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.530
Takumi. Have you heard anything about this?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.330
No, not a word.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.870
No one knows about this? What's going on?

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.340
S-Sorry!

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.480
Itsuki... you didn't...

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.470
I... I accepted the challenge!

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.520
Please forgive me!

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.660
Yesterday, Nakazato of the
Night Kids really came here.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.500
He came by when Iketani
and Takumi were out. I...

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.330
I couldn't help but pretend to be
a member of the Speed Stars...

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.730
...and before I knew what was happening...

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.600
...he had already issued
the challenge and driven off.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.510
Why didn't you tell us about this before?!

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.110
I was going to tell you, I swear.
I was just waiting for the right moment.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.550
Takumi, I'm sorry. I messed up.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.350
Please forgive me!

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.550
It's a bit late now...

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:31.290
Forgive me... Please forgive me...

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.030
Looks like the R32's out again tonight.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.700
He's racing against the
Eight-Six tomorrow night, right?

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.370
I'm definitely going to watch that!

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.110
If Nakazato of the Night Kids
is challenging the Eight-Six

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.450
that beat Keisuke Takahashi,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.080
there's no way we can miss that!

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.050
On the surface it may seem like a race

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.450
between the Speed Stars and the Night Kids,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.160
but it's really a battle
between Nakazato's pride

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.860
and the pride of the Red Suns'
Takahashi Brothers!

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.930
No matter how the race turns out,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.760
Ryosuke Takahashi's not going
to just sit back and watch.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.930
The summer nights are
starting to heat up already!

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.600
Oh, man...

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.340
What are we going to do?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.580
Everyone around town's
talking about this race.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.850
It's too late to back out now.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.380
Maybe I'd better ask Takumi to race.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.420
Even Takumi might not have
what it takes to go against the R32.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:41.300
That Night Kid Nakazato is as famous
a racer as the Takahashi Brothers...

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.770
It'd be a tough battle. It might
even be over from the get-go.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:52.210
On second thought, maybe I
shouldn't ask him after all.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.060
There you go.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.730
Hey... Dad.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.360
Is an R32 any good?

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.670
R32? Yeah... That's a fast car...

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.370
Could you win? In a downhill...

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.340
...against the R32?

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.610
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.250
Do you think... I can win?

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.290
I don't know...

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:43.190
It'd be a close race.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.730
Why are you asking?

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.930
You gonna race an R32?

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.960
No...

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.770
I'm... I'm just asking...

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.360
See ya.

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.550
<i>Now it's against an R32...</i>

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.250
<i>I'd better adjust the Eight-Six's settings...</i>

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.020
<i>It'd be a close race.</i>

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:00.600
I thought I'd find you if I
came here around this time.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.310
It was about this time the night I first met you.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.810
So you're going against Nakazato
from the Night Kids, huh?

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.550
You're the talk of the town.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:15.380
For your information, I don't
recall accepting that challenge.

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.220
What?!

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.650
He came to challenge me while I was away.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.560
I don't intend to race him.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.890
What do you mean you
don't intend to race him?

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.330
Night Kid Nakazato issued a
personal challenge to you, right?

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.530
Why don't you just accept it?

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.010
Show him who's the fastest! You can beat him!

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.410
Why does it matter to you?
This is between him and me.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.380
No, it's not just between you two!

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.280
It's because you beat me!

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.620
If you lose to anyone, it's gotta
be to the Takahashi Brothers!

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.960
Until one of us beats you,
you can't lose to anyone else!

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.530
Not even to the R32!

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.530
I said I wasn't going to race him!
I have no reason to.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:08.400
Reason? Does any racer need a reason to race?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.410
Who ever said I was a racer?

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.510
I'm in no mood for jokes!
Are you being sarcastic?!

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.750
In order for your technique
to be as good as it is,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.050
you must have practiced for years!

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.720
Why would someone drive
like a racer if he's not a racer?!

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.990
I don't drive like I do because I like it.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.860
I have to in order to help out at home.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.390
Stop denying it.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.760
No one can get as good
as you if they hate driving.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.500
That's not it... You wouldn't understand.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.400
You're the one who doesn't understand!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.370
Could someone who hates
racing ever master drifting?

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:50.380
Only a person who loves the sport
could master something like that!

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.380
Maybe you don't realize it, but you're a racer.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.750
Deep down you love driving! You hear me?!

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.990
If you love driving, then that
makes you racer enough!

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.860
And if you're a racer, then you should
be proud of your driving skills!

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:11.570
Accepting challenges is a racer's pride!

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.130
You make me sick.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.660
<i>Do I really like driving...</i>

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.590
<i>...but just don't realize it?</i>

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.560
<i>Still...</i>

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.270
<i>...being forced to accept every</i>
<i>challenge that comes along...</i>

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.570
<i>That isn't for me!</i>

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.380
Hey! Itsuki! Where's Takumi?

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.240
He's on the late shift today.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.410
Oh...

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.280
Iketani...

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.950
I'm going to go to Mt. Akina
tonight to apologize to Nakazato.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.560
Itsuki...

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.530
I'll get down on my knees if I
have to and tell him the truth.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.130
Maybe he'll understand.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.460
Besides, the Speed Stars had
nothing to do with this...

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:21.000
You don't think we can
convince Takumi to race?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.370
No. I know him better than anyone,
and he'll never do it...

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.180
He hates being forced into things

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.050
or having to follow others' orders.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.210
He looks real mellow,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:37.580
but once he says something,
there's no changing his mind...

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.320
<i>Stubborn... just like his father.</i>

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.330
He doesn't understand why
racers have to accept challenges.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.430
The whole system offends him.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.900
When someone tries to force
him to do something, he snaps.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.740
One time in eleventh grade, he flipped out

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.540
and beat up a group of
seniors after soccer practice.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.200
What?! Takumi did that?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.320
Boss, I finished cleaning up outside.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.230
Thanks.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.630
No problem. See you tomorrow, then.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.160
Takumi!

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.470
Come and have a seat.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.130
Okay...

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:33.240
You know, I overheard some talk.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.580
You're going to race an R32 tonight?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.180
What? I'm...

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.880
Don't do it, Takumi. That guy's bad news.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.750
Uh... No, I wasn't...

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.890
No, no. I know what you're going to say.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.860
I've known everything from the beginning.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.060
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.200
Itsuki was the one who screwed
up and accepted it, right?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.230
Yeah...

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.270
You know, you're too nice sometimes.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.870
You gotta stop bailing your
friends out all the time.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.210
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.480
There's a lot you don't know about cars.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.510
Do you even know what an R32 can do?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.810
Is an R32 that amazing?

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.790
<i>Gotcha! He took the bait...</i>

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.160
It's beyond amazing.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.330
That car's in a class by itself!

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.200
Its driving system combines everything good

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.030
about FR and four-wheel drive.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.300
It's a beast!

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.070
An Eight-Six or GT-R is no match for it.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.340
If the driver was an amateur,
you'd have a chance,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.210
but you're up against a famous racer, right?

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.510
<i>Dad didn't tell me this.</i>

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.710
<i>He said it'd be a close race.</i>

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.150
Hey.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.050
You with me?

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.820
You just became famous yourself
by beating that team from Akagi.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.490
You shouldn't ruin your name so fast...

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.260
It's not wise to go up against someone
you have no chance of defeating.

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.000
You hear me?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.200
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.570
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.510
<i>A coward?!</i>

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.410
Boss...

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.450
Thanks for the warning...

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:27.220
...but I could care less
about my fame as a racer.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.260
So you aren't going to back down?

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.030
No.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.400
Hearing about how amazing that car is

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.530
has only made me want to see it in action.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:49.400
I'm not afraid of an R32 or any other car.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.820
Whew!

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.880
He's exactly like his father...

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.720 line:50 %
"Temporarily Closed

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.720 line:50 %
Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.600
Temporarily closed?

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.730
Dad never said anything about this.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.840
How's he going to make
money if the shop's closed?

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.170
Oh, no! The car!

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.580
If he went out drinking, I'm really in trouble.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.880
He won't be back until morning!

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.420
I can't do anything without a car.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.790
I should have asked to borrow it this morning!

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.860
Look at the crowd!

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.560
There's even more people out
tonight than at the Akagi race!

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.230
Why did so many people come tonight?

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.930
You know they're not here to see the R32.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.940
Yeah, they want to see that Eight-Six drift!

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:56.980
They say he barrels through
corners as if they're straightaways!

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.110
I can't wait to see this!

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.180
Oh... I see...

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:08.490
Uh, if he happens to show up,
could you ask him to call home?

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.350
Thanks...

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.000
It's no use... I can't find him...

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.400
Damn!

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.360
Where the hell are you?!
Give me back my Eight-Six!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910

<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060

<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

<i>Kenji, who do you think will win</i>

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.170
<i>this battle Itsuki got us into,</i>
<i>the R32 or the Eight-Six?</i>

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.400
<i>Of course, I'd like to say the Eight-Six...</i>

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.270
<i>...but I don't know if even Takumi</i>
<i>can beat a GT-R, the fastest domestic.</i>

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.270
<i>The biggest question is if</i>
<i>Takumi will even come to race!</i>

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.240
