00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.120
<i>On the edge of danger,</i>
<i>I wanna shout and break out!</i>

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.920
<i>Now we gotta start let's get move!!</i>

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.820
<i>Let's move into the brand new world</i>

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060
<i>Let's dive into the brand new trip</i>

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.830
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.100
<i>We've just begun, now we go</i>

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.500
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.270
<i>Trip to the world</i>
<i>Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.340
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.540
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.410
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.750
<i>So many people in this world</i>

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.180
<i>It's not as if there isn't</i>
<i>backstabbing once in a while</i>

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.020
<i>Let's warp past these boring things</i>

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.520
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.540
<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.800
<i>What's going on? I'm so tense I could die.</i>

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.030
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.470
<i>I'm not really sure if I love</i>
<i>driving that much, but...</i>

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.950
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.280
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.690
Anyway, that's the story.
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.930
You'd better hurry, Takumi! It's almost time.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.700
--It's him!
--He's here!

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.070
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.880
It's too late to run.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.240
<i>I'm dead!</i>

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.030
What the hell are you doing

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.900
sitting in the middle of the road, Itsuki?

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.700
Ta... Ta... Ta...

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.930
Get out of my way! I'm gonna run you over.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.140
Takumi! You came!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.380
Yeah.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.850
Sorry, Itsuki... for being late.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.420
Takumi...!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.260
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.520
Takumi...!

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.020
Wait... don't...

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.930 line:50 %
"Act 9: Battle to the Limit!"

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.030
<i>Jeez, he's young!</i>

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.230
<i>Bet he hasn't even had his</i>
<i>license for more than a year!</i>

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.340
<i>Where'd a kid like this learn his technique?!</i>

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.540
<i>I thought for sure I'd be</i>
<i>facing a guy older than me!</i>

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.850
<i>So that's a GT-R...</i>

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.660
<i>It's beyond amazing.</i>
<i>That car's in a class by itself.</i>

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.590
<i>Its driving system combines everything</i>
<i>good about FR and four-wheel drive.</i>

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.930
I'm Nakazato... one of the Night Kids.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.200
What's your name?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.700
Takumi Fujiwara.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.440
I'll remember that.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.030
What do you say we get started?

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.410
--Who do you think's gonna win?
--Nakazato, of course!
--R32!

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.080
Now you tell me

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.420
that heavy understeer during full throttle
is the better setting if you have skills,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.460
but if maneuverability is suddenly different,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.590
don't you think Takumi's going to
panic when he charges into corners?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.360
Maybe you should've warned him...

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.230
It wouldn't have done any good.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.140
He's not exactly a driver
who drives with his head.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.880
What?! Then all the more reason to tell him!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.410
It's all right.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.510
You don't have to worry.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.320
See, he might not be too sharp upstairs...

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.720
..but his body and his senses are finely tuned.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.850
It's too late to think first and react

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.190
to the information you feel
on your back through the seat.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.930
Your arms and legs have to move
unconsciously to control drifting.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.530
That's why you don't need to worry!

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.370
He has this great sense of knowing
when and how to accelerate

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.000
while the car is drifting.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.200
So even if the suspension
setting is a little different,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.770
it won't matter to him in the least.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.870
He'll make minor adjustments

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.840
and just ride it out.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.570
See, the Eight-Six is a car that trains its driver.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.620
Here's the goal.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.610
The road's clear of regular traffic,
so anytime you're ready...

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.690
Iketani! We can go anytime!

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.200
All right!

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.400
I'm gonna start the countdown!

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.560
Start in ten seconds.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.050
Takumi! I'm counting on you!

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.220
Keisuke...

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.420
We're gonna have the best seats
in the house for tonight's battle!

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.860
Now hop in! They're about to start!

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.990
5...

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.920
4... 3...

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.260
2... 1...

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.920
Go!

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.040
The R32 is ahead!

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.060
Yeah, but Takumi's not too far behind!

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.940
Here they come!

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.440
Get your seat belt on!

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.160
Hey! That's the FC.
Ryosuke Takahashi just dashed out!

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.360
Is he trying to horn in on the race?!

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.630
What the hell...?! Is it going
to be a three-way super battle?

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.160
Suddenly, it's turned into a
race for the fastest in Gunma!

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.640
<i>The GT-R driver... He's slowing down...</i>

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.090
<i>Is he waiting for me?!</i>

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.390
<i>It'd be a waste to lose</i>
<i>him on the straightaway.</i>

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.230
<i>I wanna have a battle here!</i>

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.690
<i>The real starting line comes</i>
<i>as soon as we hit the first corner!</i>

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.670
Hey, look at that!

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.480
Nakazato's easing up on the gas
and waiting for the Eight-Six!

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.010
Hope his overconfidence

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.610
doesn't end up costing him
in the last half of the race!

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.880
Here they come!

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.380
The first corner... and all
three cars, taking it in a row!

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.900
<i>Wow! Just like Bunta said!</i>

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.200
What the hell...?!

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.740
No way, mister!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.010
Pulling stunts like that

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.530
ain't gonna get you caught up to me!

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.640
Getting to eyeball it from this close up...

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.950
That drift looks just like a work of art!

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.680
A four-wheel drift in full throttle, and
he's barely applying the countersteer!

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.290
Do you realize how incredible that is?!

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.020
He's pushing that Eight-Six to its outer limits

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.360
and controlling it like it was
his own hands and feet!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.360
Even I can't control the FC like that!

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.800
It's exciting!

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.200
Yeah, maybe, but little by little,
Nakazato is gaining ground!

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.470
Can the Eight-Six win this one?!

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.710
<i>Yes! This is it!</i>

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.880
<i>It's like I can feel the blood</i>
<i>rushing through my veins!</i>

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.190
<i>This is the battle I've been waiting for!</i>

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.190
<i>Ready, boy? I'm really gonna cut loose now!</i>

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.380
<i>Let's see how far you can keep up!</i>

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.840
<i>Hey...</i>

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.240
<i>Something's different...</i>
<i>Something's different with the car!</i>

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.710
<i>Even if I floor the gas,</i>
<i>the car doesn't lose control.</i>

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.580
<i>Does this mean I can step on</i>
<i>the gas sooner than before?</i>

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.390
<i>When I was at work today,</i>
<i>did Dad fiddle with it?!</i>

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.920
<i>'Cause it sure wasn't like this</i>

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.420
<i>when I made the deliveries this morning!</i>

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.030
<i>Now I get it!</i>

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.060
<i>That's why he was out before!</i>
<i>He was working on this!</i>

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.730
<i>Don't know why...</i>

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.100
<i>But anyway, it does feel</i>
<i>a whole lot better this way!</i>

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.800
<i>Because it doesn't slide too much...</i>
<i>I can push it all the way!</i>

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.150
--Yow!
--Amazing!

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.450
That's some un-freakin'-believable drifting!

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.400
That's the first time I've seen a guy
drift all the way through that corner!

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.870
Yeah, he's nuts!

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.270
He'd never be able to do it if he didn't
have total mastery over his speed!

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.770
What the heck was that?!

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.510
That's no kind of drift I've ever seen before!

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.010
Incredible! That's drifting I'll never forget!

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.840
Man, oh, man!

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.280
The Eight-Six is still on the R32's tail!

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.740
He's doing it!

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.310
Looks like Takumi's sticking
right behind the R32!

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:59.810
Mind-blowing!

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.350
I mean, Nakazato's an ace...

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.680
Line him up with Ryosuke
Takahashi, another superstar,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.220
and you got a battle royal brewing already!

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.690
And my best friend's racing against
both of 'em?! Unbelievable!

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.390
I mean, that is too cool!

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.400
Well, yeah, but...

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.930
...Ryosuke Takahashi and his
FC aren't even in the race.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.240
He's acting more like a third-person witness.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.270
Right. Takumi's up against Nakazato here.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.240
His R32 has the Eight-Six at a disadvantage...

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.710
But with Takumi at the wheel,
the Eight Six'll pull through in the end!

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.750
Oh, yeah. Takumi will take it, for sure!

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.180
Right, guys!

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.200
He's creeping further and further away!

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.440
Nakazato's got a big mouth,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.440
but it looks like he's got
the skill to back it up!

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.380
Look at how he distributes the load,

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.180
subduing the understeer while driving!

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.880
He really knows how to
draw out the GT-R's power.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.580
Not pretty to look at...

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.890
This is not the time to take it easy.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.390
Hey, bro...

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.860
Whose side are you on, anyway?!

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.160
If the kid loses this one, it's all over!

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.060
The real contest is only about to begin.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.660
The first half has comparatively
more long straightaways...

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.330
Lots of gentle slopes, too.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.730
There are lots of
disadvantages for the Eight-Six.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.200
But the inclines are gonna start
getting rougher right around here.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.770
Perfect for a downhill
specialist to strut his stuff!

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.690
<i>All right! This kind of low-gear hairpin curve</i>

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.960
<i>is right up the R32's alley!</i>

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.760
<i>All I gotta do is cut my speed</i>
<i>by slamming on the brakes...</i>

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.570
<i>Going downhill, like it or not, the front</i>
<i>wheels still have to bear the load,</i>

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.680
<i>so its weakest point, the pushing</i>
<i>understeer, hardly occurs.</i>

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.050
<i>Furthermore, accelerating from a low gear</i>

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.080
<i>is what this car does better than any other!</i>

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.550
<i>The fastest machine on the racing circuit...</i>

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:18.820
<i>...is the toughest machine even on open roads!</i>

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.390
<i>The R emblem on the rear</i>

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.890
<i>is the legendary symbol for invincibility!</i>

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.560
<i>Can you get close enough to read it?!</i>

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.070
Hey, Iketani...

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.440
What?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.710
I've been thinking.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.340
'Till now, I thought Takumi

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.250
was just a unique racer

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.750
who's fast only when he's racing on Akina.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.750
But if he raced on a different mountain pass,

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.090
how well would he drive?

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.590
Don't you wonder about that?

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.290
Well, sure, I've mulled it over...

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.960
But right now, all I'm thinking
about is the battle at hand!

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.560
Win, Takumi!

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.360
Takumi!

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.080
<i>Oh, man!</i>

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.080
<i>My eyes can't keep up with him!</i>

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.190
<i>Looks like he's finally kicking out the jams!</i>

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.560
<i>His inside tires are gripping the rim of the road!</i>

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.530
<i>This is the one! The trick that I lost to!</i>

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.900
<i>Didn't think I'd ever get</i>
<i>the chance to see it again!</i>

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.110
<i>Ryosuke's stopped with the chatter.</i>

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.050
<i>Meaning there's no time for that now?</i>

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.690
<i>I've ridden shotgun with him tons of times...</i>

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.360
<i>But this is the first time I've</i>
<i>seen him driving like this!</i>

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.860
<i>I've never seen him so serious!</i>

"Akina Skate Center"

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.640
<i>Getting closer...?!</i>

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.000
<i>The Eight-Six is catching up to me?!</i>

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.700
<i>Impossible!</i>

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.440
<i>Brilliant! Catching up to me after all that...</i>

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.280
<i>All my prejudices about the</i>
<i>Eight-Six being a 10-year-old car</i>

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.940
<i>have just been blown away!</i>

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.610
<i>It's a first-rate fighting machine!</i>

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.150
<i>Okay, the kid gloves are off!</i>

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.890
<i>Man, this is the best rush I've had in ages!</i>

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.720
<i>In fact, this has gotta be the</i>
<i>hottest road race I've been in</i>

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.520
<i>since getting this car!</i>

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.570
<i>When it comes to hairpin turns,</i>

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.540
<i>he can't match the R32!</i>

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.570
<i>No matter how close the</i>
<i>Eight-Six sticks to the R32,</i>

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.710
<i>the distance between them</i>
<i>always widens after a hairpin!</i>

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.940
<i>Man, that Nakazato's got guts, too...</i>

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.380
<i>Attacking the road like that,</i>
<i>downhill in a heavy-ass R32!</i>

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.820
<i>Wha-What the...?!</i>

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.700
<i>The Eight-Six closed the gap</i>
<i>at the high-speed corner?!</i>

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.870
<i>Going over 100 kilometers an hour</i>
<i>while doing a four-wheel drift</i>

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.340
<i>close enough to graze the guardrail?!</i>

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.280
<i>I don't think any of it has to do</i>
<i>with the car's capabilities!</i>

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.780
<i>That guy... has got a screw loose!</i>

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.350
<i>If he makes one slip-up, he's roadkill for sure!</i>

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.950
<i>But now I understand his secret!</i>

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.520
<i>With a lightweight like the</i>
<i>Eight-Six, if he loses speed once,</i>

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.020
<i>it takes like forever to get it back up again.</i>

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.690
<i>He never lets himself lose a fraction</i>
<i>of speed more than he has to!</i>

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.230
<i>Now I finally get why,</i>

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.900
<i>when I raced against him,</i>

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.800
<i>he could always catch up to me,</i>
<i>no matter how many times I lost him!</i>

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.140
<i>Crap!</i>

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.940
<i>I can't shake him!</i>

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.070
<i>Just the opposite!</i>

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.110
<i>He's hanging on to me for</i>
<i>longer and longer periods!</i>

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.010
<i>The bastard... is tough!</i>

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.260
<i>Nakazato's clearing the guardrail</i>
<i>by a good 20-30 centimeters.</i>

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.200
<i>No matter how fast you are,</i>

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.200
<i>that's about right.</i>

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.730
<i>Yet the Eight-Six's bumper</i>

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.470
<i>is almost close enough</i>
<i>to the rail to make sparks!</i>

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.370
<i>That guy's in a league of his own!</i>

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.940
<i>How?! How can he control a drift</i>
<i>with that kind of precision?!</i>

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.060
<i>Since I've been steering</i>
<i>hard and using the ABS,</i>

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.070
<i>the load on the front tires has</i>
<i>been a lot heavier than I thought!</i>

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.040
<i>This race is suddenly getting</i>
<i>much more challenging!</i>

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.570
The five hairpins are coming up...

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.940
That's where he left you in the dust.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.910
And I bet that's gonna be
a key point this time, too.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.450
<i>An R32 versus an Eight-Six...</i>

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.750
<i>Who would've thought the</i>
<i>battle would be this fierce?</i>

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.020
<i>Both of those cars are</i>
<i>being taken to their limits.</i>

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.250
<i>But which one of them</i>
<i>is gonna take the prize?!</i>

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.520
I'm at the hairpins! And I can hear 'em coming!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.600
<i>Ryosuke, most expected the R32</i>
<i>to have a great advantage.</i>

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:37.000
<i>The R32 is 4,640 mm long and 1,720 mm</i>
<i>wide, and weighs a thousand...</i>

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.170
<i>In other words...</i>

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:43.780
<i>In other words, the R32 is 4,640 mm</i>
<i>long and 1,720 mm wide...</i>

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.580
<i>In other words, traveling</i>
<i>downhill, Takumi might...</i>

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.920
<i>In other words, the R32 is 4,640 mm long and...</i>

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.090
<i>All right already! Next time on Initial D,</i>
<i>"The 5 Consecutive Hairpins"!</i>

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.020
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
