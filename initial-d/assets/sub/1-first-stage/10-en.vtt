I can't believe Nakazato is
having trouble with an Eight-Six!

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.010
There goes the Eight-Six's braking drift!

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.080
He's good!

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.460
<i>That Eight-Six turns corners using the gutter.</i>

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.340
He's definitely not giving
up the inside position!

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.980
That's Nakazato.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.210
What are you gonna do, Eight-Six?

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.850
Wha...?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.820
What?! From the outside?!

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.760
--Watch out!
--He's going to crash into us!

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.540
Don't insult me! Not from the outside!

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.060
The R32's acceleration is amazing!

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.090
What about that Eight-Six?

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.660
He slid through that narrow turn.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.630
Three more turns...

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.530
...and this race is over.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.420
He's going outside again!

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.160
You're irritating me!

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.030
Stop messing with me from the outside!

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.510
The R32's movement is unsteady.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.110
Nakazato is losing his patience.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.180
--Yeah?
--Watch, Keisuke.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.170
The Eight-Six will make a move.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.050
<i>Make a move?</i>

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.450
<i>When there's no room on the inside...</i>

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.290
<i>...how can he pass?</i>

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.620
Takumi's making a move?!

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.180
Are you serious?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.230
--Come on!
--Go for it, Takumi!

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.740
<i>This is humiliating. You keep</i>
<i>pushing me from the outside</i>

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.210
<i>in front of all these people!</i>

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.710
<i>I can't attack the corner because</i>
<i>I'm staying inside too much.</i>

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.590
<i>One car width should be enough</i>
<i>to keep him away from the inside.</i>

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.220
<i>That way, I can go in with more speed!</i>

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.190
Good! He's going outside!

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.880
<i>The Eight-Six is gone!</i>

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.550
<i>It can't be!</i>

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.820
<i>What?!</i>

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.570
Whoa...

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.200
Wow!

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.800
<i>Damn it! The understeer is acting up!</i>

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.540
<i>He faked going to the outside</i>

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.510
<i>and snuck inside while braking!</i>

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.720
<i>The Eight-Six can perform tricks like that?!</i>

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.220
<i>But the race isn't over yet.</i>

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.050
<i>I can still move ahead</i>

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.890
<i>in 2nd gear at full blast!</i>

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.420
<i>I'll show you what my R32 is capable of!</i>

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.820
<i>I lost.</i>

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.000
<i>My R32 and I lost the race.</i>

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.830
<i>No... I lost the race.</i>

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.330
<i>My R32 didn't lose to that Eight-Six.</i>

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.010
<i>I never thought racers like that existed.</i>

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.090
<i>Losing was a shock...</i>

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.260
<i>...but somehow I feel satisfied,</i>

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.750
<i>because I gave it my best.</i>

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.360
Darn...

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.600
Another 70,000 yen to fix this.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.170
I'll train harder and try again.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.170
Takumi won the race! He did it!

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.320
Guys, he did it!

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.660
--Takumi won the race!
--Yeah...

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.960
I can't believe it!

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.830
The Eight-Six passed the
R32 on the fourth hairpin!

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.850
How can an Eight-Six beat a R32?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.140
--That Eight-Six won?
--I still can't believe it!

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.380
<i>You were right, Bunta.</i>

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.510
<i>You called it.</i>

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.190
Wasn't that fun and educational, Keisuke?

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.490
Yeah, that move the
Eight-Six used was amazing.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.060
He faked going outside

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.260
and snuck inside while braking fully.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:11.240
He must have great ABS.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.280
You don't get it, do you, Keisuke?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.450
The Eight-Six doesn't come with ABS.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.010
But...

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:23.180
That Eight-Six has human ABS.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.520
Street racers who only drive cars with ABS

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.390
can't learn the strict pedal control

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.690
required to stop just before the brakes lock.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.870
After all, ABS can't outperform the right foot

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.630
of a highly experienced driver like him.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.870
It's been a while since I got that into a race.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:52.310
That Eight-Six is a worthy target for us.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.850
What are you staring at it for?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.750
Nothing...

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.250
Hey, Dad, this car...

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.030
What about it?

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.570
Nothing... never mind.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.900
I'm going to bed.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.860
What? How?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.880
I bought an Eight-Six!

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.280
I kept it a secret, but it came today!

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.450
It's relatively new.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.850
You finally convinced your
dad to co-sign for you.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.190
Well...

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.920
The guys at the shop were friendly,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.420
and I think I got a great deal!

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.060
Yes!

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.560
It's in good shape.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.690
You're lucky.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.900
I can't believe you actually bought it, Itsuki.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.740
I had to, Takumi.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.210
I have to catch up with you, you know?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.380
I'll train hard to be your
"Downhill Eight-Six" partner.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.550
I see your mouth got bigger.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.380
I couldn't sleep last night...

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.390
...'cause I was so excited!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.890
I know that feeling.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.830
I couldn't sleep the night before I got my S13.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:23.160
I couldn't help it, 'cause it's my own car.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.930
My car... I feel like I'm dreaming...

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.270
'70s tires with original hubcaps...

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.340
So cool!

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.940
Why don't you start it up, Itsuki?

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.500
Sure thing!

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.460
It doesn't sound too sharp...

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.930
It must be because of the original muffler.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.130
Don't worry, I'll get a new muffler.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.730
I want it to sound as cool as Takumi's Trueno.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.010
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.840
Pop the hood, Itsuki.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.490
--I knew it...
--Boss?

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.830
You got it all wrong, Itsuki.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.830
What do you mean?

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.600
--This isn't an Eight-Six.
--What?

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.340
It's an Eight-Five.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:41.240
An Eight-Five... as in AE-85?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.220
An Eight-Six and an Eight-Five
have the same body,

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.960
but their abilities are as far
apart as chalk is from cheese!

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.060
An Eight-Six has a DOHC engine,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.300
while an Eight-Five has an SOHC.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.500
DOHC and SOHC are
completely different, you know?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.840
Didn't you check the engine
before you bought it?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.740
Stupid!

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.980
Sorry, Itsuki, but it's funny...

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.140
My stomach hurts!

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.320
Itsuki, wait!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.500
You went too far.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.370
Put yourselves in his position.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.600
We're sorry.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.070
Itsuki!

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.740
Just leave me alone, okay?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.080
I can't.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.860
I wanted to surprise you guys...

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.630
...but I was an idiot for buying a car by myself.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.130
I knew it was too cheap for an Eight-Six.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:14.970
I'm so embarrassed for acting
like an idiot in front of you guys.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.570
I know you're laughing at me inside, too.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.540
You're wrong.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.650
The fact of the matter is, I envy you.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.650
You envy me?

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.380
Don't lie!

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.380
It's not a lie.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.220
You're still in high school,

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.020
and already have your own car.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.830
--My own car...
--Yeah.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.860
So what if it's an Eight-Five?

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:44.260
It has an engine and four tires.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.370
It may not have power,
but it'll go fast downhill.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.830
You can still practice your skills.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.450
Cars are fun...

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.180
--You've changed...
--Have I?

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.160
You weren't into cars as much before.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:13.890
Takumi, I feel like I can
be proud of my Eight-Five.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:18.730
--I don't deserve an Eight-Six yet.
--You're right.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.570
You don't have to agree!

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.470
I may go for a spin at Mount Akina tonight.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.040
Wanna come, Takumi?

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.050
Sure... in your Eight-Five.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.850
Takumi...

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.520
Yippee!

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.650
I'll come get you around 10:00 tonight.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.520
--Sure.
--Don't fall asleep!

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.860
I didn't see the famous Eight-Six.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.170
I wanna take a look at it.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:57.870
I can't imagine an R32 losing to an Eight-Six.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.390
--That's an Eight-Six.
--Is that him?

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.800
Wow, that was fun! Akina Pass is the best!

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.230
It's slow going straight,

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.570
but it corners like the
real thing, right, Takumi?

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:31.200
Sure.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.980
What are you doing?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.490
If you look at my Levin from a distance...

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.820
...it does look handsome!

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.230
My Levin is so cool!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.100
I'm glad I bought my Levin!

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.070
I'm happy for you, too.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:06.210
--They're kids.
--It can't be them.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.940
The famous racer who beat the R32

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.840
couldn't be a little kid!

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.850
No way!

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.850
How old are you kids?
I hope you have a license.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.190
Otherwise, I'll have to tell the police.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.290
Yes, I do! I may look cute, but I'm 18.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.630
<i>Who do they think they are?</i>

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.160
--Stop tormenting them.
--I don't like it.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.630
A kid like him is driving an Eight-Six

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.740
and acting like a street racer.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.340
You live around here?

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.710
Do you happen to know the
famous Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.580
Don't act dumb. We know you know him.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.580
I, uh, I've heard of him...

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.090
...but he probably won't be here tonight.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.320
Darn, we came all this way for nothing.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.990
Let's get out of here.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.530
I tell you what, kid.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.700
If you wanna act like a racer,
at least try to look like one.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.340
I mean, look at this
Eight-Six with its ugly wheels.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.740
It's embarrassing!

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.670
Pitiful!

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.910
And change the muffler,
'cause it sounds pathetic.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.850
Don't you know anything
at all about an Eight-Six?

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.680
Well, actually...

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.390
...this is not an Eight-Six, it's an Eight-Five...

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.360
...so a new muffler won't make any difference.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.790
I'm thinking of getting one, though...

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.920
An Eight-Five?

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.370
No one carries new mufflers
for an Eight-Five anymore.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.770
Nobody!

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.210
I'm crying!

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.880
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.040
It suits you well though, kid!

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.910
--Let's go.
--Thanks for the laugh, kid.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.440
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.950
That's it! They're gonna pay!

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.020
Itsuki, do you mind if I drive your car?!

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.350
But, Takumi!

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.880
Go to the passenger side. Hurry!

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.360
What are you gonna do, chase them?

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.060
This is only an Eight-Five with
loose suspension and '70s tires.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.460
It doesn't matter!

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.370
We don't have to do this, Takumi!

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.970
It doesn't have LSD, either!

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:51.230
Shut up and put on your seat belt!

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.140
It may get rough,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.610
but just trust me, okay?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:02.180
I promise I won't crash your precious car.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.910
Here we go!

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.530
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.830
P... Please...

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.430
Take good care of my Eight-Five!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.040
<i>What's wrong, Mr. Iketani?</i>

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.180
<i>By the way, I heard a red EG6</i>
<i>was after Takumi's Eight-Six.</i>

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.750

<i>--No.</i>

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.290
