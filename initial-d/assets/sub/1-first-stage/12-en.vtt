00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.760

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.740
Thank you very much!

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.350
I was really furious!

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.720
So, he was braking while
cornering... at high speed?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.560
I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.160
Really?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.270
Everybody does that!

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.600
I step on the brake while
cornering all the time.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.940
Uh-oh, I'm going too fast...

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.180
I'm scared... step, step...

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.880
We're not talking about a beginner...

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:52.390
This EG6 cleared those downhill
turns at an incredible speed.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.620
EG6?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.690
It's a Honda Civic!

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.700
Why don't they just call it a Civic, then?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.960
The Civic is very popular among street racers,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.400
even though it's an FF.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.800
It's a non-turbo 1.6 liter like your Eight-Six,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.980
but its VTEC engine has tons of power.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.810
It has been a rival of the Levin
and the Trueno for years.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.690
As an Eight-Six driver,
you should know about the Civic.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.990
As a Levin driver myself...

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.980
...I can't let a Civic pass me!

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.400
Anyway, I just can't believe
it went in at that speed

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.930
and then braked.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.770
Well, that technique is called left foot braking.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.370
Left foot braking?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.240
You usually don't use
this technique with an FR,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.850
but you brake with the left foot

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.420
to stabilize the car at
an extremely high speed.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.890
With an FF like an EG6,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.590
you need your right foot on
the gas pedal continuously

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.020
to avoid understeering,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.690
so you brake with your left foot

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.500
to take the weight off the rear
tires and turn more sharply.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.400
He must be a highly experienced
FF driver to use that technique.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.670
I'm sure he's fast.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.810
He was pretty fast... That punk...

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.880
I only avoided crashing
because I'd just practiced

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.820
spinning with the emergency brake.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.220
Otherwise, my S13 would've
been in the shop again!

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.750
I'm gonna make that EG6 pay!

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.540
Hey, someone called for you earlier.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.570
--Who was it?
--I didn't ask.

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.210
A girl... A pretty girl.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.010
She said she would call back.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.950
How could you tell she was
pretty over the phone?

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.790
I've developed good intuition over the years.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.820
Cars and women... it's all about
experience and intuition.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.950
--Good luck with both of them.
--Yeah, yeah...

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.330
Well, I'm off to a meeting...

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.720
Uh... Fujiwara Tofu Shop...

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.890
--Hello, Takumi?
--Oh... Mogi...

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.660
Were you sleeping?

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.250
Remember the other day you were saying...?

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.450
This better be real, Takumi!

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.970
If this turns out to be a joke... you'll be sorry!

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.320
Are you sure she's bringing her friend?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.820
Don't worry...

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.360
Mogi said she was bringing her friend.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.160
I wonder if she's cute... or has a nice body...

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.170
...or maybe she is beautiful!

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.870
I think she is Mogi's junior high school friend.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.910
As long as she is decent-looking...

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.810
I shouldn't expect too much...

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.020
I can't believe you kept your promise, Takumi!

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.350
I'm so lucky to have a good friend like you...

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.890
It's nothing, really...

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.160
I'll be the best racer at Mount Akina
with a pretty girl in my arms.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:01.000
Not on my Levin, you darn pigeons!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.640
They should be here by now...

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.200
Hey!

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.440
Were you waiting long?

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.980
--Don't do that, Mogi!
--Hi.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.380
Itsuki, this is my friend Saori.
Saori, this is Takumi and Itsuki.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.150
Nice meeting you.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.780
You, too.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.480
She's... very pretty...

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.670
So you are a street racer?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.740
Well, I belong to a team
called the Akina Speed Stars,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.840
and I'm the third or fourth fastest...

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.320
I'm well known in Gunma
as "Levin of Mount Akina."

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.550
Pretty cool!

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.650
What's a street racer?

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.890
What, you really don't know?

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.520
A street racer is a...

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.190
<i>Oh, man! She's far beyond my expectations!</i>

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.250
Watch out, Itsuki!

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.710
--Want me to drive?
--No, I got it.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.270
Sorry, a street racer's bad habit...

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.130
Feeling okay?

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.620
I'm fine...

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.430
He drives kind of rough...

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.730
Hey! Takumi and Natsuki!

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.470
Look at us!

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.940
Why don't you join us?

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.810
They do look good together.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:55.440
Yeah...

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.380
Need a ride home?

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.850
Thank you, but Saori and I
have a lot to catch up on.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.190
I had a good time, Itsuki.
Maybe we'll do it again.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.260
--See ya.
--Yeah.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.130
Uh, Saori...

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.730
See ya, Saori!!

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.800
Yeah!

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.690
Not bad... she's not bad at all...

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.850
Saori.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.490
I feel life energy surging through me...

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.660
Saori!

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.400
Watch the road, will you?

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.260
Don't worry!

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.730
I don't know how to thank you, Takumi.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.040
Yippee!

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.370
"Maybe we'll do it again," she said...

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.270
Maybe just the two of us next time...

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.330
--Hey, light!
--Wha...?

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.860
Sorry... I'm sorry...

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.230
Thank you very much!

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.770
Well, what should I do next?

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.580
Work, work, work...

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.650
He's in a good mood. Did he meet a girl?

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.580
--Maybe...
--He can't have a girlfriend before I do!

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:17.360
By the way, Takumi,
would you like to drive my S13?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.260
It's refreshing to drive
different cars sometimes.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.930
No, thank you.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.270
I'll pass. I mean... you love that car...

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.770
Please, Takumi?

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.440
I can learn so much from watching you drive it.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.070
Please?

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.020
Are you serious about racing
against the Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.250
You'll see.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.130
All right, let's go.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.150
<i>Come on out, Eight-Six of Mount Akina.</i>

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.710
<i>I can hardly wait...</i>

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.530
Do I really have to?

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.990
Please, Takumi.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.200
Just drive normally...

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.500
It'll still be educational for me.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.730
I'll owe you big!

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.400
I'm not really good with
other people's cars, so...

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.670
I don't think I'll be any help...

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.440
He's begging this much, so just this once?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.350
Yeah, Takumi. Just this once.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.350
Okay, just this once, then.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.350
Please don't expect too much.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.220
You will?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.710
Yeah!

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.560
All right, Iketani. Just don't faint again...

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.130
Don't worry, this is my second time around...

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.970
Bring it on, Takumi!

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.730
--Here we go, then.
--Yeah!

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.520
What should I do first?

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.590
Well, how about showing me a braking drift?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.390
Okay.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.730
Wha... hey...

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.390
Are you doing it at the first turn?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.430
Aren't we going in a little too fast...?

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.470
I hope Iketani's all right.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.140
It's...

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:35.760 line:50 %
"Iketani Passes Out!"

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.080
"Wow! I... I saw it!

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.850
The agonized cry of his last
moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.050
The scary downhill!

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.150
Iketani, in the third corner...

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.920
...passed out!"

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.690
...all over again, perhaps.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.610
<i>He can drift effortlessly in a</i>
<i>car he's never driven before...</i>

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:02.120
<i>I never knew my S13 could go this fast!</i>

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:07.960
It's different from my Eight-Six,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.390
But we only went through three turns...

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.690
I'm ready for a drift.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.320
<i>A drift? Then what was he doing before?</i>

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.170
I think I got it right on that last turn.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.760
<i>It's too advanced for me to understand...</i>

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.320
They're back!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.300
Oh, man. You made it this time.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.040
You've conquered it!

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:34.310
So, did you get a good look
at his braking drift, Iketani?

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.840
Not really... no idea...

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.250
So much for begging him to show you how.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:48.160
Yeah, but he made it look
so simple that I realized...

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.060
...I'm not even close to
understanding his technique!

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.530
I feel like a better racer already!

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.090
Wha...?

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.710
That's the EG6 from yesterday!

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.380
That punk!

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.650
Hey, you!

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.660
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.330
Who are you?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:03.230
Don't tell me you forgot this S13!

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.000
Oh, you...

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.070
That's right! You owe me an apology.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.840
I could've gotten badly hurt.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.010
Are you kidding me? That was your fault.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.040
What?

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.850
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.280
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.720
I tried to brake, but... bump.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.390
What did you say?!

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.690
Calm down, Iketani!

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.630
What a jerk!

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.030
Stepping all over Iketani's pride...

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.970
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.070
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.470
What do you mean, "your" rules?

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.480
It's nothing.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.450
We call it the "duct tape death match."

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.880
Duct tape death match?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.150
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel...

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.720
...and then race. That's all.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.660
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel?

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.500
Your shifting hand stays free...

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.760
<i>My right hand and the steering wheel...</i>

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:18.710
You can't switch hands...

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.070
You can't steer!

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.180
Too dangerous...

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.680
For you, definitely.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.550
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:38.390
Maybe this kid can help you out?

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.870
Tell this Eight-Six kid

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.480
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.810
We'll have a duct tape death match...

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.680
I'll see you then.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

<i>Did something good happen, Itsuki?</i>

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.700
<i>I'm going to have a girlfriend!</i>

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.870
<i>Really? Congratulations!</i>

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.510
<i>Who is the lucky girl?</i>

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.110
<i>--The girl from the double date.</i>
<i>--Saori?!</i>

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:47.780
<i>Wait, the fortune also tells</i>
<i>you not to push too hard,</i>

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.050
<i>or you'll find yourself in trouble.</i>

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.720
<i>Next on Initial D, "First Date!"</i>

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.420
