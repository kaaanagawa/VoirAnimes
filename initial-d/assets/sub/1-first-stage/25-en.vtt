00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.670
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.460
<i>In the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.130
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.800
<i>My body is frozen in a</i>
<i>memory that I can't shake</i>

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.570
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.710
<i>Broken in the night</i>

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.910
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.050
<i>All from someone's whim</i>

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.290
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.920
<i>And just love you</i>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.690
--Takumi, it's for you.
--Who's it from?

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.460
Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.860
What?!

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.630
Ryosuke...

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.360
...Takahashi.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.170
<i>Less power, but fast!</i>

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.340
<i>He clears the corners faster.</i>

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.970
<i>There's no way my brother will lose to him now!</i>

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.480
A battle?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.680
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.990
No, a "battle" is a car race.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.820
If you don't want to race, just ignore him.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.460
It's not that I don't want to.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.860
I may lose to him,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.970
but I don't want to not race him.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.030
You still don't think Takumi can win?

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.340
No. I know he's exceptional,
but he's still in high school.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.350
I wonder how long he'll even
be able to stay in the race.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.180
<i>The only reason I think Takumi has a chance...</i>

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.090
<i>...is that he's Bunta's son.</i>

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.750
<i>The son of that crazy Bunta...</i>

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.090
Keisuke...

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.730
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.530
but when I lose a street race...

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.340
--...I'll retire.
--What?!

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.910
By the way, there are only two racers

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.210
who I think could beat me one day.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.750
One of them is you, Keisuke.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.250
Me?

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.410
And the other is...

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.270 line:50 %
"Act 25: The Last Battle!"

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.300
Takumi!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.230
Good luck, Takumi!

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.470
I believe in you! I know you can win!

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.270
And I hope you beat Ryosuke Takahashi

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.270
and become the fastest
racing star in Gunma, Takumi!

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.570
Takumi!

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.580
Okay, we got it, Itsuki! Now get off of him!

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.080
You're late.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.080
It's already 10:00.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.580
You're still so ignorant.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.480
I've been waiting for you.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.660
It's impressive that you've
learned so much technique

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.120
at such a young age.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.530
I've just driven Akina Pass more
than others, so I'm used to it.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.860
I don't have any special technique.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.910
I think you are just overestimating me.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.980
That's interesting.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.650
I guess you don't really
understand your own potential.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.380
What?

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.680
You're so unique.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.520
It'll be nice to sit down
and talk to you someday.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.540
Big brother...

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.740
Let's get started.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.010
This should be a fun evening.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.010
All right! Move your cars!

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.880
Yes, sir!

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.060
Is it all right if we Red Suns run this race?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.220
Sure.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.860
Get some guys from Speed
Stars to be officials, too.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.630
--Got it.
--Iketani, I'll be at the goal.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.890
All right. Do a good job!

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.970
Keisuke, I'll be at the five hairpins.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.210
Okay.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.210
Of course Ryosuke will win, won't he?

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.980
We're going to get our revenge, right?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.280
Of course we are.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.880
No matter how fast that guy is,
there's no way my brother will lose.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.980
You're right. Okay, I'm off!

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.650
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu-- Oh, it's you.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.250
Hey, Bunta. I just got to Akina.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.590
There's a huge crowd over here.
You'd be amazed if you saw it.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.460
Yeah, and...?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.030
So, what do you say?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.460
Do you think Takumi can win this?

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.800
I hear that his opponent is
Gunma's fastest, a street racing king.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.170
Who cares?

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.800
If you don't have something
else to say, I'm hanging up.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.940
Hey, Bunta!

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.280
Wait a minute, Bunta!

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.710
I told you not to hang up!

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.870
All right! How are the corners looking?

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.830
Okay! The first corner is ready whenever.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.150
Skate Center here.
This straight section looks good.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.350
The 17th hairpin is ready anytime.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.560
Five hairpins here.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.490
No cars around here, and we're ready!

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.000
This is Number Six.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.160
We've moved all the
spectators' cars. We're ready!

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.960
I'm so nervous!

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.590
My throat is completely dry,

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.300
and my heart is pounding out of control!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.230
The air around this whole
pass is filled with tension.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.930
I wonder if Takumi is feeling all right?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.070
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.280
<i>You're racing against the best.</i>

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.250
<i>It doesn't matter if you lose. Just do your best!</i>

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.050
<i>Come on, Takumi!</i>

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.140
<i>I know you can win this!</i>

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.730
<i>There's no way my brother will lose.</i>

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.500
<i>But something always happens</i>

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.330
<i>in Akina Pass when that Eight-Six is racing.</i>

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.690
Excuse me. What's happening with the race?

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.490
It hasn't started yet.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.980
Oh, I see. Thank you.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.770
This is the starting line.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.700
How does it look at the finish line?

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.200
Yeah... we're ready here anytime.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.310
Okay! Let's get going!

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.970
Hold on a minute!

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.650
Let me do the countdown.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.710
Just for this race. Okay?

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.530
<i>I have to do the countdown for this race</i>

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.020
<i>between my big brother</i>
<i>and the Eight-Six myself.</i>

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.500
I'm starting the countdown!

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.710
Five... Four...

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.680
Three... Two... One...

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.380
Go!

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.360
Go, Takumi!

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:52.130
All right! Takumi's going right by him!

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.750
Takumi is ahead of him now!

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.380
Takumi! Keep going!

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.960
<i>That's my big brother's strategy.</i>

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.400
<i>He always lets them get ahead at first,</i>
<i>and then catches them later.</i>

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.430
<i>That's how he's been winning his races.</i>
<i>His "fastest racer" theory can't go wrong!</i>

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.950
They're both amazing!
Extremely close twin drifts!

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.550
Using that much drift isn't
Ryosuke Takahashi's style at all!

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.720
What a show, right from the beginning!

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.980
Even Ryosuke Takahashi
started using drift right away!

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.380
I bet he wants to beat Takumi
using Takumi's specialty,

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.980
just to show the willpower
of a street racing king!

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.920
Takumi is doing great, too!
This is going to be an amazing race.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.720
Wow, Takumi! You've got to win! Go Takumi!

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.860
Right, Iketani?

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.990
Um... right...

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.840
<i>How impressive...</i>

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.930
<i>The Eight-Six has never driven like this before.</i>

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.360
<i>I knew it. He has improved!</i>

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.310
<i>He uses very little</i>
<i>counter-steering as he stabilizes</i>

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.310
<i>in the final moment of drift.</i>
<i>That hasn't changed.</i>

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:50.220
<i>But he counter-steers less</i>
<i>right after a turn-in maneuver.</i>

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.790
<i>I don't understand.</i>

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.990
<i>It hasn't been that long since the last race,</i>

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:59.130
<i>and his weakness is already gone.</i>

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.490
<i>He is improving in every race.</i>

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.500
<i>I need to change the scenario a bit...</i>

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.340
<i>...but that's all.</i>

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.310
<i>The result will be the same.</i>

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.830
<i>My "fastest racer" theory is invincible!</i>

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.580
Hey, Takeshi...

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.250
Let me just tell you that I didn't park
here just because your car was here.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.850
Don't you make any mistake about that.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.490
I was planning to park here
before I even arrived.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.360
Why don't you go away?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.770
No way! I also knew that this was
the only spot to watch the race.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.330
You're the one who should go away.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.610
All the beginners usually want to
watch it from such obvious places...

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.150
...like the five hairpin curves.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.550
Right.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.280
The race isn't decided in a spot like that.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.990
This is the only point where
they could go for the win.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.990
So, that's what you think too, huh?

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.630
Let me just say that you're impressive.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.560
You, too.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.730
So, this place is really deserted, huh?

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.570
If someone sees us here,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.700
they'll think we're friends.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.410
Shoot! How annoying!

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.650
Here they come!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.370
Whoa! They're both getting
so close to the guardrail!

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.120
Oh, my god! That was amazing!

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.350
Whoa! What am I waiting for?!

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.260
I've got to tell him.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.450
How annoying...

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.970
--Hello, Fujiwara...
--Hey, Bunta! Are you listening?!

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.770
Heck, it's you again.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.940
Listen hard!

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.740
They just passed in front of me.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.150
They were both drifting very hard,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.710
with Takumi's Eight-Six ahead

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.150
and the FC right behind him.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.550
Takumi was ahead?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.090
That's not good...

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.790
Not good? Why?

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.660
Calm down a little, Yuichi.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.830
It's more advantageous to chase
the other car than to run from it.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.440
That's common sense.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.270
That's true.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.780
The rear driver can study the course
and rhythm of the other driver.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.520
If he's skilled enough,
he can also copy the driving.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.190
But maybe he can also just drive away.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.820
The driver in front is
under tremendous pressure.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.510
Having another car follow
you at the same speed

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.940
gradually pushes you into a mental corner.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.320
The harder you try to get away,
and the longer you're followed,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.010
the more threatening your opponent seems.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.730
On top of that, Takumi is still
new to such racing tactics.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.670
I'm sure he's really freaking out by now.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.700
You think so?!

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.170
Anyway, I'll give you a call
later with the outcome.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.800
All right.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.580
That boy... Will he lose?

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.310
Maybe not...

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.240
Here they come!

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.120
This is incredible!

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.660
This is the 24th corner.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.900
The Eight-Six and
Ryosuke's FC just passed here.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.340
We've checked the time, and it's just amazing!

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.140
If they hold this pace, they'll break
the Eight-Six's course record...

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.580
...by seven or eight seconds!

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.740
Anyway, that's my report.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.320
<i>Seven to eight seconds faster</i>
<i>than when I raced against him?</i>

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.490
<i>Give me a break!</i>

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.020
<i>Is this what happens when my</i>
<i>big brother gets really serious?</i>

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.660
<i>This is starting to get scary.</i>

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.360
<i>This race is going to become legendary.</i>

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.670
It looks like Takumi is still in the lead!

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.170
All right! He can win this thing, right, Iketani?

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.200
Yeah. But I wonder how
long he can keep this up?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.680
--What?!
--That's Ryosuke Takahashi he's racing against.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.280
I'll be happy if Takumi can
just finish this race safely.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:56.170
<i>I'm going at full power,</i>
<i>and he's right on my tail!</i>

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.640
<i>No matter how fast I go, I still can't get away!</i>

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.420
<i>It's no good... I might lose this race.</i>

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.490
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi...</i>

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.530
<i>I can't even compare to such a great racer!</i>

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.600
<i>I really don't want to...</i>

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.570
<i>...but I'm going to lose!</i>

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.890
<i>--You know...</i>
<i>--I don't want to lose.</i>

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.500
<i>--Fujiwara Tofu...</i>
<i>--This race...</i>

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.170
<i>--His sense for drift...</i>
<i>--I don't want to lose!</i>

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.540
<i>Ryosuke, I...!</i>

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.340
<i>--Takumi, go!</i>
<i>--You can't lose...</i>

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.070
<i>Just like that!</i>

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.410
<i>Keep going!</i>

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.170
<i>Win!</i>

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.710
<i>Heading towards the conclusion</i>
<i>of this emotional race...</i>

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:52.820
<i>Next on Initial D: "The New Downhill Legend!"</i>

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.810
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
