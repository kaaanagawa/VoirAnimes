There must be some way to
make Takumi stop daydreaming.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.650
The race is on the 15th,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.020
so we still have one more week.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.020
It's a good thing it's not tomorrow.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.360
Aren't the Red Suns and the
Night Kids racing tomorrow?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.830
That's it!

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.000
Take Takumi there and
make him watch their race!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.170
It could be exciting enough

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.030
to snap him out of his daydreaming!

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.070
That's a good idea. That should do the trick!

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.170
He'll have a rude awakening.

"Act 22: Fierce Uphill Battle!"

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.000
Hey, Dad, I've been thinking...

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.870
About what?

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.510
I raced at Usui Pass the other night.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.770
I thought it would be totally
different from Akina Pass.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.420
But as I drove it...

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.790
...I realized that it felt very similar to Akina.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.420
Very good.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.860
Is it?

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.730
Usui is a completely
different course from Akina,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.700
but you ran your usual race on it.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.140
It's about how much "Akina"
you take with you to other courses.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.100
--Good luck with the deliveries.
--Okay.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.260
<i>How much "Akina"I take with me...</i>

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.480
<i>I think I sort of understand</i>
<i>what he's trying to say.</i>

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.490
I need a nap.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.370
He's completely lost in a daydream.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.640
Okay, let the operation begin!

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.380
Hey, Takumi!

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.050
Big news! Don't freak out!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.650
The Red Suns and the Night Kids
are battling it out tonight!

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.820
--So?
--What do you mean, "so"?!

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.990
Since you're taking on
Ryosuke Takahashi next week,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.360
this race is a must-see!

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.200
Okay, then!

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.540
Let's take your Eight-Six, since it's a
waste of gas to drive two cars there.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.010
--Mine?
--I'm getting fired up!

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.180
You're excited too, right?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.380
Right...

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.210
I'll meet you at your place at 7:00.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.980
Don't forget to borrow the Eight-Six!

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.670
The crowd is huge.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.840
Are Takumi and Itsuki here?

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.570
Not yet.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.180
I sure hope Itsuki was able to pull this off.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.020
Hurry up, Takumi, or we'll miss the race.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.350
We got lost because you didn't
want to take the toll road.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.520
You're too cheap.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.860
Look who's talking.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.360
You're the one who didn't drive to save on gas.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.460
I've never heard of a racer
with no sense of direction...

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.140
<i>This must be a side effect of his daydreaming.</i>

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.230
I got it.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.770
We really gotta hurry!

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.820
You made me wait.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.960
The main character shows up last.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.630
Myogi's ravine is steep, so try not to die.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.800
Enough. Your hands are shaking.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.610
Don't worry, it'll be quick.
No Night Kid can touch me.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.100
Your arrogance could end your life.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.450
Let's go, before the rain starts.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.490
--Yeah.
--An Eight-Six!

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.750
Akina's Eight-Six came!

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.920
<i>An Eight-Six?</i>

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.700
Check out this huge crowd!

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.710
Just concentrate on finding them, okay?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.610
I know...

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.780
...but it's hard to spot them in this crowd.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.510
Where should we park?

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.520
What about the top?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.350
There's a big parking lot.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.290
All right, let's go up, then.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.530
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.570
<i>You're getting me fired up.</i>

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.400
<i>Eight-Six, I'll show you</i>
<i>how much I've improved.</i>

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.010
--An Eight-Six!
--You mean Akina's?

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.410
--Yeah.
--Is it really?

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.020
Hey Takumi, is it just me,

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.490
or do you think people are looking at us?

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.220
--Yeah.
--What do you mean, "yeah"?!

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.260
They totally recognize us.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.830
Akina's Eight-Six is famous now.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.500
They have their eye on you, you know?

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.600
It was a good idea to drive the Eight-Six here.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.870
What are you muttering about?

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.580
Okay, come forward!

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.540
Forward!

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.860
Okay. The road is clear!

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.190
I'll count down!

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.260
Five... Four...

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.430
Three... Two...

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.560
One... Go!

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.580
Wow! What a fast start!

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.310
<i>I know Keisuke will win.</i>

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.050
<i>Don't lose. It's not an option on our turf.</i>

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.920 line:50 %
"Takahashi"

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.660
It's started.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.390
<i>Rain...</i>

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.500
<i>The FD's best weapon is</i>
<i>its high cornering speed.</i>

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.270
<i>Don't forget that, Keisuke.</i>

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.680
Takumi?

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.510
Don't you think Myogi Pass
is similar to Akina Pass?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.850
I don't know.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.320
It seems more like Usui Pass to me.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.190
It's nothing like Usui!

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.850
<i>It's no use. He's totally lost,</i>
<i>out in the deepest sea.</i>

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.500
Take a good look at it!

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.300
It's not as narrow as Usui,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.840
and this uphill is just like Akina's.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.470
I mean the rhythm is similar.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.810
Rhythm...?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.340
<i>Be careful! An FD is quick around corners.</i>

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.340
<i>I never thought anyone could</i>
<i>follow me up Myogi's hill.</i>

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.220
<i>He's starting to abuse the steering.</i>

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.690
<i>He's trying to speed away.</i>

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.320
<i>If he did that on a downhill,</i>
<i>the tires would compress.</i>

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.810
They just passed the mid-point.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.280
The R32 is in front...

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.880
...but it's very close.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.390
I see.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.150
Tell me one thing...

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.160
How did Keisuke look coming out of the turn?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.830
He was one step slower than Nakazato,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.100
but overall, he seems under
control and very smooth,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.970
unlike Nakazato's aggressive
but inconsistent run.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.000
I got it. Thanks.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:32.450
<i>You've improved, Keisuke,</i>
<i>to be able to race like that.</i>

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.450
The R32 is in front. Very tight!

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:41.290
They just passed me.
Nakazato is barely in front.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.130
It sounds like Takeshi is doing well.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.990
He's been training hard.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.530
He became a different person
after losing to the Eight-Six.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:57.840
<i>I've always considered Takeshi</i>
<i>to be my enemy. But now...</i>

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.940
<i>Knowing that he's fighting for</i>
<i>our pride, I feel the camaraderie.</i>

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.470
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.790
The R32's in the lead!

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:14.480
Win, Takeshi! I'm counting on you!

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.400
I can hear the squeals, but I can't see them.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.400
What?

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.060
Rain...

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.980
Oh, no! They're battling at full speed!

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.750
It's most dangerous
when it first starts raining.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:43.420
The rain lifts up the dirt and oil on
the surface and makes it slippery.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.650
They could easily crash.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.270
<i>Raindrops...</i>

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.170
<i>Darn, couldn't it have waited?</i>

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.370
<i>I gotta be alert.</i>

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.700
<i>I could lose control without warning.</i>

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.370
It's really coming down.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.370
I hope they don't stop the race.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.050
--Hey, Itsuki?
--Yeah?

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:51.250
Since that's the finish line,
this must be the last corner, right?

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.320
Yeah.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.820
That's the highest point in Myogi Pass,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.160
so this is a downhill corner.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.320
The only downhill corner.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.500
Here they come!

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.160
<i>This is it!</i>

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:35.690
<i>That's suicidal! You'll crash</i>
<i>into the wall at that speed!</i>

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.140
<i>I know I can do this!</i>

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.130
<i>My FD's telling me I can!</i>

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.680
They're coming at us!

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.000
The FD won!

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.250
I'm so impressed!

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.550
Man, Keisuke Takahashi is good!

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:37.390
<i>This is the first time that I</i>
<i>was inspired by other racers.</i>

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:42.560
<i>Seeing a great race like</i>
<i>that makes me restless.</i>

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.270
You got lucky, Keisuke Takahashi.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.410
No, it was skill.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.870
What?

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.040
The last corner was downhill,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.350
so I knew it would come
down to the front tires.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.520
You couldn't quite control them

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.890
because they were too compressed.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.630
I kept up my speed,
but maintained the tire pressure.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.920
It was skill.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.980
You did it, Keisuke!

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.750
Should we do a downhill race?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:39.590
We can't keep going in this rain.

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:41.890
--Right.
--Then, Keisuke...

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:45.330
--...please let me race the Eight-Six.
--What?

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.660
This isn't Akagi or his home course,

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.400
so this is as fair as it gets.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.970
--Hey.
--Iketani.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.800
Who is he?

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.330
--No idea.
--Kenta!

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.800
Takumi Fujiwara, isn't it?

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.350
Kenta Nakamura of the Red Suns.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.750
How about me and you in this rain?

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.350
We gotta talk to my brother first.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.190
Let's ask the spectators, Keisuke.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.030
Wanna see us battle it out in the rain?!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:22.660
--Yeah!
--Come on!

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.000
--Darn.
--Hard to say no now.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.640
But he's racing against
Ryosuke Takahashi next week.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.170
I'm first.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.850
If you can't beat me, you're
certainly not worth Ryosuke's time.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.020
What do you say?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.690
I love racing in the rain.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.720
Don't tell me you're scared of the rain?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.360
No, not now!

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.700
He hasn't, uh, been himself lately.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.700
Sure, why not?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.460
Wow!

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.740
--Hold it.
--No one can stop it now.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.710
--But...
--He's not anyone's "private" target.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.380
Every racer wants a piece of him.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.550
I know you understand that feeling.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.390
That's more like it.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.990
Downhill in the rain.
That makes it a pure skill race.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.690
Set your proud Eight-Six next to mine.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.430
--Let's go, Itsuki.
--I'm going, too?

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.440
If I leave you here, I'll have
to come back up afterwards.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.170
Let's just race down and go straight home.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.350
So, I'm getting in, then?

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.190
Wait, Itsuki, do you mind sitting in the back?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.420
In the back? Okay, I guess.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.890
Is this a strategy?

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.730
Maybe it is... maybe it isn't.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.230
What? You don't know yourself?

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.100
How do I stay seated when you drift?

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.410
--You'll manage.
--What?! Hey!

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.710
It's only from here to the
bottom of the mountain.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.380
It's not over. There's one more race.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.610
I hear Akina's Eight-Six is racing!

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.590
No oncoming traffic!

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.320
Let's do this!

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.390
I wasn't expecting this.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.160
Yeah. But there's nothing we can do now.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.660
Don't worry, Keisuke.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.970
I like rain.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:44.100
Before I joined the team,
I purposely waited for rainy days

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.110
to practice my drifting technique.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.750
The rain reduces the wear on the tires.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.450
I see you're confident,
but don't take it lightly.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.990
I'm the most experienced in the rain.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.690
I know I'm better than him in the rain,

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.350
because the rain is on my side.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.470
Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.800
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain?

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.310
Who knows?

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:23.010
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.680
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.680
I'll take it easy,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.950
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.680
That's true.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.030
<i>But if he loses this race,</i>
<i>there won't be a race against...</i>

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:42.120
<i>...Ryosuke Takahashi!</i>

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.970
I'll count down!

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.070
Five... Four...

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.000
Three... Two...

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.500
One... Go!

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.150
Ouch!

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.940
This isn't... normal!

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.800
<i>You seem confident in the rain, Kenta.</i>

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.700
<i>Yes, I am confident.</i>

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.000
<i>I'll win because Keisuke is watching me.</i>

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.400
<i>But even Keisuke lost to this Eight-Six.</i>

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.370
<i>I'm avenging that loss! This is for Keisuke.</i>

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.640
<i>--This is your first time here...</i>
<i>--No problem!</i>

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.710
<i>I have to give it my best for Keisuke!</i>

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.250
<i>Kenta, do you have feelings for Keisuke?</i>

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.680
<i>I, uh...</i>

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.890
<i>Next on Initial D: "The Rainy Downhill."</i>

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.650
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
