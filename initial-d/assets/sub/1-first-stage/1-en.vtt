Even the 1991 model costs 1.3 million yen.

The S13 is expensive.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.670
Like I thought, it's gotta be the Eight-Six.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.400
The Eight-Six is a real possibility.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.110
Takumi!

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.350
Hey! Are you listening?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.250
I'm listening, Itsuki.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.580
So how much is this Eight-Six?

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.690
Well, this one is 300,000 yen...

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.350
...but it hasn't passed inspection.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.590
How much have you saved so far?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.690
About 50,000 yen.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.460
You've got a long way to go.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.900
Yeah... Yeah...

Isn't there any way to make
a lot of quick money?!

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.470
With our current part-time
jobs at the gas station,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.040
even if we work full-time
during summer break,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.040
we'll only make 120,000 yen at most.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.180
There's gotta be a better job out there.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.210

What? Is it so strange that I'm talking to you?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.490
Not really...

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.990
You said you could get 120,000
working full-time this summer.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.430
How many hours are you
supposed to work every day?

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.370
From early in the morning till late at night.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.770
What?!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.440
You can only make 120,000
a month for that much work?!

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.170
That's about right...

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.410
Wages for high school students are really low!

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.280
I didn't know...

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.540
I've never had a part-time job...

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.020

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.630
Sure!

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.530
She just said, "Let's get together!" didn't she?

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.000
--Yeah.
--Go out with Mogi?!

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.400
Good! Good!

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.470
Takumi, why didn't you tell me?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.480
--You should have told me you're Mogi's friend.
--I haven't talked with her in about a year.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.010
We were in the same club.

We talked a lot until last summer.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.690

Who cares about that?

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.650
I've been checking her out
for a while... She's so cute...

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.270
Takumi! Hey, Takumi! Quit zoning out!

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.000
If we don't hurry, we'll be in big trouble!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.670

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.230
Wait up!

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.550
Hey, why don't we buy an Eight-Six together?!

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.180
If we combine our money,
we can afford the loan.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.350
No way.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.190
Why do you want a car that badly?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.590
Your family already has a car, right?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.990
It's no good.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.690
My old man's car is an automatic
and front-wheel drive.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.500
And it's a diesel. It's crap.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.830
I wouldn't even call it a car...

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.900
It has four tires and it runs. It's a car.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.870
You just don't get it.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.810
If it's not fun on the mountain pass,
you can't call it a car.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.910
What do you do on the mountain?

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.680
What do you think?! We're going
to challenge the corners!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.490
Challenge the corners...?

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.920
Is that fun?

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.890
Of course it's fun!

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.860
You're a guy and you don't
want to tackle the corners?!

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.160
I'm already tired of that kind of stuff.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.400
What? What do you mean?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.530
We just got our licenses last month.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.720
You look cute.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.020
That outfit always looks great on you.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.520
Really? Thank you, Papa.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.900
You know, Papa, one of my
classmates is working part-time.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.870
He says even if he works all summer,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.710
he'll only earn 120,000 yen.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.380
Well, that's about right.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.980
It's hard earning money, isn't it?

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.990
You spend more than that on me in a month.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.830
Is it really all right to spend so much on me?

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.500
Of course. You're worth it.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.270
Really?

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.390
I don't understand...

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.540
--Thank you very much!
--Thank you very much!

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.680
Hey, Takumi! Please think
about the Eight-Six deal.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.520
I don't care about an Eight-Six!

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.790
You kids have good taste...

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.550
...trying to get an Eight-Six.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.720
See? See? Iketani thinks so too, right?!

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.190
Yeah, the Eight-Six is a good car.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.860
I told you.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.230
But I...

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.200
To be honest, I don't know
what an Eight-Six is.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.240
Who makes it?

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.140
Are you serious, Takumi?

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.970
Want to drink some high octane?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.640
Working at a gas station and
you don't know the Eight-Six?!

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.640
What a disgrace!

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.480
Oh, well. It's no surprise.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.020
When the Nine-Two model came out,
you guys were just in 2nd or 3rd grade.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.590
We have an old car at my house,
but we just use it for our deliveries.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.320
You can't compare that to an Eight-Six!

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.730
Even if it's old, the Eight-Six is special!

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.000
When we buy an Eight-Six,
will you let us join your team?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.230
I've always dreamed of joining
the Akina Speed Stars.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.000
Sure! Oh, by the way...

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.440
It's Saturday, so everyone is
meeting at Mt. Akina tonight.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.040
You guys wanna come along?

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.680
What?! Can we?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.110
But we don't have a car...

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.010
I'll give you a ride.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.290
We can ride in your S13?!

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.460
I'll go! I'll go! I'm definitely going!

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.890
You're going too. Right, Takumi?
This is a rare opportunity!

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.130
--Um, I never said I wanted to go.
--Cool! I can meet the whole team!

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.140
Excuse us. We're going home!

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.170
All right! I'll pick you up
at the bus stop at 8 PM.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.730
Okay!

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.740
You're really into it.
Which mountain are you going to?

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.350
Boss, Mt. Akina is the only mountain
around here worth racing on.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.320
We're the fastest team on Mt. Akina.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.990
Many claim that they're
the fastest on Mt. Akina.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.830
When I was still racing,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.530
there was a guy that everyone
admitted was the fastest.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.330
And he's still driving on Mt. Akina.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.000
Still?!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.940
I know all the racers at Akina...

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.840
...but none of them are that old.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.240
It's just because he drives during
a different time. Because...

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.750
...he's now the owner of a tofu shop.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.850
What?

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.850
About 4 o'clock in the morning,

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.350
he delivers his tofu to the hotels at Lake Akina.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.290
It's amazing to watch his downhill speed.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.430
Because it's his business,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.790
he makes the run every day,
even in the rain and snow.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.600
He knows even the smallest stain
on the asphalt on Mt. Akina.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.900
I'd even bet on it.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.570
The fastest downhill car on Mt. Akina...

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.310
...is the Eight-Six from the tofu shop.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.470

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.950
Yeah. I have plans with Itsuki.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.490
I don't care if you're out at night,

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.360
but I'll drag you out of bed if you
don't wake up in the morning.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.030
You don't need to remind me.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.050
I'm going.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.350
Shut up, Takumi!

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.680
You're ruining Iketani's concentration.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.550
Whatever! But this sucks, and I'm scared!

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.620
No big deal. Everyone gets scared
when they ride with a street racer.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.350
Next, we'll take the hairpin in second gear!

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.560
You're still too noisy, Takumi!

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.770
All right. Tonight, I'm going all out.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.450
Are you all right, Takumi?

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.550
I didn't think you'd get that scared...

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.490
I was in the mood and
pushed the car quite a bit.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.990
You're a wimp, Takumi! Shame on you!

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.490
You're the type who screams
on roller coasters, aren't you?!

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.330
I've never thought that
roller coasters are scary.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.730
It's not like that...

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.200
Itsuki, even if I explained it to you,
you'd never understand...

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.170
...this fear...

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.830
What?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.520
<i>I've never seen them before...</i>

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.190
<i>They're headed for Mt. Akina</i>
<i>at this time of the night?</i>

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.600
<i>Something may happen</i>
<i>on the mountain tonight.</i>

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.200
We've got visitors.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.560
<i>The Red Suns?</i>

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.920
<i>Are they the Red Suns,</i>
<i>the fastest drivers in Akagi?</i>

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.350
We're the members of
the Akagi Red Suns Team.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.620
I don't want to be rude, but...

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.860
Who's the fastest team, or driver,
on this mountain? Please tell us.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.130
--What do they want?
--We're the fastest.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.900
We're the Akina Speed Stars Team.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.200
We consider ourselves the fastest here.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.410
Then we've found what we're looking for!

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.370
Would you like to hold a practice session

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.210
with our team, the Akagi Red Suns,
here at Mt. Akina?

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.650
--What?
--Are they serious?

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.750
Wow! What a great turn of events!

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.250
What do you think?

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.860
Since we usually only run with people
we know, it's becoming routine.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.490
Running against other teams
gives us a new challenge.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.160
We can make new friends
and exchange knowledge.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.530
And it improves our skills, too.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.500
At first, we can run together.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.240
Then each team will be
represented by one driver

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.070
to compete in both uphill and downhill.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.010
We aren't concerned about winning or losing.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.880
We only seek to develop
friendship between the teams.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.550
What do you think?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.580
--If you put it that way, how can we refuse?
--Okay.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.050
How about next Saturday at 10 o'clock?

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.750
Okay, fine.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.590
Today, we'll just take it easy.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.620
Awesome! This is awesome, Takumi!

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.870
We don't need to be intimidated!

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.570
--We're going, too!
--Yeah!

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.720
Iketani!

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.520
Let me watch the Takahashi Brothers--

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.660
people call them the fastest in Akagi!

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.330
You mean the Takahashi Brothers,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.900
the famous street racers who've
been featured in the magazines?

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.700
Yes. They're also known
as "The Rotary Brothers."

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.010
Iketani! What about us?!

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.210
Sorry. When I make a serious run,
I don't take passengers.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.010
Wait here. I'll pick you up later.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.860
This sucks! Why're we the
only ones without a car?

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.160
Hey, Itsuki...

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.400
Is it that much fun to be a street racer?

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.300
I don't get it...

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.810
Why does everyone get so excited about it?

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.040
I'm the one who doesn't get it!

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.510
We can hear the sound of cars

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.240
running hard one after another, right?

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.520
Why can't you get excited about it, Takumi?!

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.420
Excited?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.990
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu Shop...

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.190
Oh, it's just you.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.760
What a surprise...

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:41.830
Just me?

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.100
I haven't talked to you in so long,
and this is the greeting I get?

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.500
The other day, you passed me on
your way back from a delivery.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.110
I signaled, but you ignored me.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.840
Nope, it wasn't me.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.010
It had to be you. It was your Eight-Six.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.120
Well, I mean...

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.020
...it was my car, but I wasn't driving it.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.550
My son Takumi delivers tofu to the hotels now.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.290
What did you say?!

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.130
Since when?!

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.860
Five years ago.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.360
Five years ago? Since he
was in the seventh grade?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.520
Damn! I can't keep up with them at all!

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.030
<i>They're fast! I'm at my limit,</i>

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.730
<i>but I can't keep up with any of the Red Suns.</i>

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.670
What do you think, brother?

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.210
They're all trash.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.010
Even our second string can easily beat them.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.380
We don't need to bring
the top drivers next week.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.880
I'll pass.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.690
If you're not gonna come, I guess I'll pass, too.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.490
No, you should run.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.660
You should set a record for this course

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.990
which the locals can never break.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.030
Otherwise, the name of the Akagi Red Suns

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.800
will never become legendary.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.560
Yeah...

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.800
First, we'll set new records for
every course in this prefecture.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.140
Then we'll take Saitama,
Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Chiba.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.910
We'll have every record
in the entire Kanto region,

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.180
then we'll become legends,
and then we'll retire.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:43.240
That is the Akagi Red Suns'
"Fastest in Kanto Project."

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.600
They're incredible.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.440
They are completely different from us.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.610
I'm totally shocked that we got
so beaten on our home ground.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.110
They've put serious money into their
suspensions, and they've got power, too.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.550
There's no way we can
compete with the Red Suns.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.380
But how can we avoid a
challenge on our own turf?

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.150
That's right! We can't back out now!

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.290
But guts alone won't beat those guys.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.790
I know that... But...!

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.490
It's getting late.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.490
Let's get together tomorrow and talk about it.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.870
Street racers don't like losing.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.740
They get too serious about racing.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:43.140
There's nothing worse than losing to
outsiders on your own home ground.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.210
It's like a law for street racers.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.330
Where's Ryosuke?

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.060
He went home a while ago.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.500
We're the only ones still here.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.730
It's almost dawn.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.530
I guess we should head back, too.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.120
If I get serious, they can't keep up with me.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.420
They're still at that level...

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.680
Finally caught up, huh?

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.930
That's not one of ours.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.300
Is that an MR2 or a 180?

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.380
Nice driving. But after two corners,

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.750
I won't even see you in my mirror.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.000
An Eight-Six?!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.770
You've gotta be kidding!

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.690
My FD can't outrun an old Eight-Six?!

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.060
Is this some sort of nightmare?! Crap!

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.190
I'm the No. 2 driver of the Akagi Red Suns!

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.410
<i>Doesn't he know this road?</i>

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.040
<i>After this slow right, there's a sharp left.</i>

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.770
<i>If he doesn't slow down, he'll be in the ravine!</i>

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.580
I knew it! He's going too fast!

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.650
There's no more room to slow down!

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.090
What the hell?!

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.920
Inertia drift?!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.830
<i>Drift fans and Eight-Six owners!</i>
<i>Thanks for waiting!</i>

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.400
<i>At last it begins!</i>

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.330
<i>Initial D!</i>

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:35.940
<i>What did you think of</i>
<i>Takumi's super drift technique,</i>

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.270
<i>racing his 1.6 liter non-turbo Eight-Six</i>

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.010
<i>against a high-potential 350HP FD?!</i>

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.240
<i>Pretty cool, don't you think?</i>

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.050
<i>And for those who understand</i>
<i>all the technical jargon,</i>

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.020
<i>Initial D shows you the essential details!</i>

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.350
<i>Next time, get ready to watch</i>
<i>another exciting race!</i>

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.380
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
