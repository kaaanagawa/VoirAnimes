--Okay.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.260
Don't forget to check the air pressure, too.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.690
Right...

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.700
I bet today's race will be another easy win.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.740
Hey, get me that lug wrench.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.080
What are they doing?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.520
They're changing the FD's tires.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.120
They seem to have several spares in that van.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.290
They're changing the tires
to suit the conditions...

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.700
They act like professionals...

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.460
Crap...

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.100
It's ready to go any time, Keisuke.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.600
What? Ah...thanks.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.970
Isn't it past 10 yet?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.970
Well... It's about 9:40...

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.390
Dammit...!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.190
It hasn't come yet...

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.690
Brother, that Eight-Six...

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.360
...irritates me!

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.890
I was convinced that it could represent Akina...

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.600
Was I ever wrong! I've lost all my enthusiasm!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.370
Now I'm going for the best time,
and I'll run away from them.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.740
And I'm going to humiliate them.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.670
If I don't, I won't be able to stand it!

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.110
Iketani, it's almost time.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.510
Yeah... I know!

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.260
What's that?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.530
Iketani!

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.230
Iketani!!

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.030
Itsuki...

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.640
What...What about the timed run?

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.470
We're going to start in a bit.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.840
Good! I'm in time!

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.040
And who's representing the Speed Stars?

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.480
Well...

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.580
Kenji, get ready... at least mentally...

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.480
Yeah...

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.190
You're representing the team?!

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.020
Good luck! I'll be cheering you on!

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.160
This is the starting line.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.990
Are you ready?

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.370
This is the finish line.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.500
Everyone is in their designated positions.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.540
You can start any time.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.440
Roger!

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.710
So...should we start now?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.950
He didn't come after all...

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.120
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.710
Yeah...

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.560
Are you kidding? This is my opponent?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.670
Kenji.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670
You look pale.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.970
You're sweating...

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.040
We're even feeling kinda
sick just watching you.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.910
That's easy for you to say... But...

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.980
Toughen up! Get mean!

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.710
All right. We'll start the countdown.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.310
Damn...!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.350
10 seconds!

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.750
Wait a minute!

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.590
This is the finish line. A regular car
just passed us and went up there.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.900
You don't want to pass it during the race...

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.730
Should we wait until it reaches the top?

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.600
This is a public road.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.570
There's always going to be regular cars!

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.370
Forget about it! Start us!

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.510
All right.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.610
Wait a minute!

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.200
Can you ask him what make that car was?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.250
Could you tell what kind of car it was?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.220
Well... I think it was a car
with flip-up headlights...

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.690
I think it was probably a Trueno, an Eight-Six...

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.690
Give that to me!

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.160
What color was the Eight-Six?!

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.870
Why are you guys so curious about that thing?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.670
It was black and white.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.640
It's a Panda Trueno.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.200
He's here!

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.210
He showed up! My prey.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.480
What are you going to do?
Is it okay to begin the countdown?

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.980
Not yet!

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.550
Wait until the Eight-Six arrives.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.490
My real opponent shouldn't be
the 180 next to me. Right?

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.330
Yeah, that's right.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.330
Kenji, you can go back now.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.730
Yeah... That's quite a relief...

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.330
Your eyes are watering.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.500
Yours, too!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.110
He came through for us...

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.680
...so that he could protect the
Akina street racers' pride...

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.780
That's enough for me...!

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.270
Now I can start feeling like I don't
care about who wins or loses.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.500
<i>What is this...?</i>

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.540
<i>It seems strange...</i>

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.540
<i>There are people at each turn...</i>

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.810
<i>What are they doing here...?</i>

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.850
<i>I think I came to a weird place...</i>

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.320
<i>Oh, well, I guess it's all right...</i>
<i>If I win, I get a full tank of gas.</i>

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.910
<i>And I can go to the ocean without any pressure.</i>

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.440
What's up, Takeshi?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.870
Nice technique!

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.540
The way the back end moved
when it pulled out of the corner...

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.510
...was a nice touch.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.350
What?!

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.480
Didn't you see it?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.880
If you say so... But...

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:16.190
To us it just looked like a regular
Eight-Six with a brat driving it.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.060
A car driven by a street racer
who is at a level where

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.230
he can maneuver it as easily
as his own hands and feet...

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.460
...has an aura about it.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.970
Ryosuke Takahashi's driving has a strong aura.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.740
His younger brother
Keisuke's aura is still weak.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.040
But that Eight-Six was emitting a strong aura.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.250
If he represents Akina...

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.480
...the winner is up in the air.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.490
<i>He's almost here.</i>

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.260
<i>He really came.</i>

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.660
<i>The fastest man on Akina's downhill!</i>

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.530
<i>The legendary super technician!</i>

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.830
<i>We'll show the Takahashi Brothers</i>
<i>Akina's real strength!</i>

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.700
<i>Come on, Eight-Six!</i>

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.010
<i>I'm looking forward to seeing</i>
<i>who gets out of the car.</i>

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.340
<i>It's been a while since I've been so excited.</i>

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.640
<i>He's kept us waiting for so long...</i>

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.780
<i>But such an obvious</i>
<i>strategy won't work on me.</i>

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:14.480
<i>I'll be watching you very closely.</i>

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.450
Here it comes!

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.290
Give him a path! Show him to the starting line!

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.140
What's that car?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.470
Everyone was waiting for that car.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.340
But it's an Eight-Six.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.570
Crap! Where did all these people come from?!

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.050 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.160
Excuse me...!

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.070
Oh, the Eight-Six! Is it...?!

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.210
Takumi!

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.230
Wow! It's him!

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.880
So this is the guy...

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.910
Takumi!

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.110
What's going on?!

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.380
What happened to your father?!

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.310
My father told me to show up.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.380
Even if the car is here, without
your father, what good is it?

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.650
What?!

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.390
What are you going to do, Iketani?

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.990
--This isn't... what you said...
--Because you said... we're all right...

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.690
<i>--I knew I shouldn't have come.</i>
--Kenji has to race after all...!

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.060
<i>Damn my old man! He really irritates me!</i>

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.560
Takumi! Didn't your father say anything else?!

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.930
He just told me...

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.200
...to beat the FD on Akina's downhill.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.340
What?!

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.040
Did he tell you to drive?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.540
Yes...

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.210
Can you beat...

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.020
...Keisuke Takahashi?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.750
Well... I can't be sure until we really race...

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.360
I've beaten him before...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.560
You won once before...?!

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.700
A full tank of gas is riding on this race...

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.890
...so if you let me, I'll win no matter what.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.940
Excuse me... Excuse me...

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.540
Takumi! You idiot!

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.280
Ouch! What are you doing?!

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.480
Takumi! Just how stupid are you?!

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.390
I'm so embarrassed watching
you that I'm blushing!

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.890
Move your car right now!

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.090
Don't interfere with the race!

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.920
Get in that Eight-Six now!

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.490
Wait a minute, Itsuki.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.400
Iketani! I'm so sorry!

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.870
He is so stupid that he
doesn't understand anything.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.370
Please forgive him!

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.770
Takumi... Do you, by any chance,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.080
also deliver tofu, along with your father?

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.580
Now I do all of the deliveries.
For the past five years.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.670
For the past five years?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.690
Now I understand. Takumi!

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.260
All right. I'll put you in
charge of the downhill race.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.260
What are you talking about, Iketani?!

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.460
If a novice like Takumi
tries the Akina downhill,

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.030
within minutes he'll cause
an accident and he'll die!

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.900
Don't worry about it. You need
to step aside and just watch.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.640
Thanks for coming, Takumi.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.040
I'm counting on you.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.310
Yeah...

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.520
I'm sorry that we kept you waiting.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.490
Really! I'm tired of waiting!

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.190
You're pretty young...

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.660
What's your name?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.490
Takumi Fujiwara.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.400
I'll remember your name.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.330
I'm Keisuke Takahashi.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.100
I won't make the same mistake twice.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.040
Is it really all right?

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.580
It's totally foolish to race
an Eight-Six against a FD.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.210
There's a huge difference in horsepower,

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.850
and the FD is the best
domestic cornering machine.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.090
Both in the straights and in the turns,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.790
the Eight-Six is outclassed!

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.350
We just need to have faith in him...

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.400
Then we'll begin the countdown.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.240
--Roger!
--Roger!

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.310
Ten seconds to green!

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.510
Nine! Eight!

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.010
Seven! Six!

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:14.680
Five! Four! Three!

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.020
Two! One!

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.580
Go!

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.450
Fast! Keisuke Takahashi's FD!

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.850
350 horses are no joke.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.420
His shifting is perfect.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.950
It's no match.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:57.390
At full acceleration, the Eight-Six
looked like it was standing still.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.690
Takumi...

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:07.400
<i>Coming off the line, that Eight-Six</i>
<i>has 150 horsepower at most.</i>

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.510
<i>It's not quite the monster</i>
<i>Keisuke was talking about.</i>

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.140
<i>The reason why it can shift so fast</i>

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.980
<i>is that it has tranny gears for a rally.</i>

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.310
<i>It must be perfect for the hairpins on Akina.</i>

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.580
<i>Still, there's no reason</i>

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:26.420
<i>Keisuke's FD would be beat out by it.</i>

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.520
<i>The monster isn't the car...</i>

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.520
<i>...but the driver?!</i>

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.770
<i>I won't give him a break.</i>

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.040
<i>I don't like using the</i>
<i>straightaways to pull ahead,</i>

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.540
<i>but this is a timed run.</i>

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:49.270
<i>I'll never even see that</i>
<i>Eight-Six in my rearview mirror.</i>

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.320
What's that?!

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.550
This is the first corner! It's great!
The Eight-Six's line is incredible!

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.320
It wasn't more than 5 cm from the guardrail!

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.520
I've never seen anyone corner at that speed!

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.110
<i>What?!</i>

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.580
<i>He's closing the gap?!</i>

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.600
<i>He's getting closer?!</i>

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.320
<i>It must be my imagination!</i>

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.680
<i>It's impossible!</i>

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.170
Are... Are you serious?!

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.940
Takumi's father was once a great street racer?

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.370
Yeah.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.210
I've seen him several times,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.180
but he's just the gruff owner of the tofu shop.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.110
I guess you really can't tell much
about a person by just looking at them.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.350
According to Mr. Tachibana, he's still
the fastest on the downhill in Akina.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.490
Anyway, that's who sent Takumi in his place,

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.330
so we should just believe in Takumi.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.230
Yeah... It's much better than if I had run.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.630
But even if his father is fast, Takumi is...

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:31.340
It sounds like Takumi beat
Keisuke Takahashi once before.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.540
What?!

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:37.140
Takumi defeated Keisuke Takahashi?! No way!

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:42.820
I can't believe it! That spacey Takumi?!

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.080
He didn't even know what an Eight-Six was!

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.540
What?! What's in that Eight-Six?!

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.170
At incredible speed, it came
in with the rear end free

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.140
and it passed through
at an unbelievable speed!

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.780
It wouldn't be surprising if it
went airborne at any moment!

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.970
We've got shivers going up our spines!

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.690
<i>He's caught up to me?!</i>

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.990
<i>What's happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.560
Up to second gear, they're the same,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.530
but the stretch is different...

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.830
If the straight is even a
little long, he'll pull away...

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.080
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.780
The two of them just passed by!

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.750
He's on Keisuke's bumper!

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.420
Akina's Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.720
Is this for real?!

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.060
Keisuke's FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.770
Man, I've got goosebumps...

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.270
On this long straightaway,
Keisuke pulled away,

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.810
but after this, there are many
hairpins. It may be a problem!

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.410
Did you hear him, Ryosuke?

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.440
We miscalculated...

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.710
We didn't know Akina had such a great driver...

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.850
Great attack!

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.520
That Eight-Six's attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.080
He's got no sense of fear on the downhill.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.130
<i>In the straights, I'm faster.</i>

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.960
<i>But he's caught up to me.</i>

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.570
<i>That means I'm losing in the corners.</i>

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.040
<i>To be caught by a less powerful car</i>

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.940
<i>is the ultimate shame for a street racer!</i>

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.640
<i>I'll die before admitting that!</i>

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.880
<i>My old man...</i>

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.010
<i>Unless I pass that car,</i>
<i>he won't admit that I won...</i>

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.490
<i>There's no other way...</i>
<i>I guess I have to do that...</i>

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.160
<i>A full tank of gas is riding on this...</i>

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.760
<i>The setup point is in the next</i>
<i>five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Sekai ga kowaretemo kawaranai</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.000
<i>Beasty shout, dare no te ni sae oenai</i>

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.370
<i>Hageshii yume jikan sae mo ima koeteku</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, michi o hiraiteku</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>Hokori mau haishachi ni hau</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Rikutsu dake no nougakitachi</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>Jamakusai kara shikato shitekou</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>Streaker satte yuku street no mukou</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Ai mo kako mo furimukazu</i>

<i>Yukeru anata kagayaiteiru</i>

<i>Rage your dream, ima o ikiteiru</i>

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.900
<i>Finally, the race has begun, hasn't it, Takumi?!</i>

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.530
<i>--Yeah...</i>
<i>--Did you do any special practice for this battle?</i>

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.700
<i>No, not particularly...</i>
<i>It's the usual way I deliver tofu...</i>

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.070
<i>I see! The regular run you do</i>
<i>is helping you, isn't it?!</i>

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.410
<i>--I suppose so...</i>
<i>--By the way, do you have any</i>
<i>secret plan for passing the FD?!</i>

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.340
<i>Well, yes... It's not exactly a secret plan, but...</i>

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.610
<i>A date with Natsuki in the Eight-Six</i>

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.550
<i>with a full tank of gas is riding on this,</i>

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.280
<i>so you have no option but to win!</i>

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.380
<i>--Yes...</i>
<i>--Next time, Initial D!</i>

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.090
<i>Something will happen in the</i>
<i>five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:55.890
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
