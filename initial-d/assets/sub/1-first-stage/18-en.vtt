That's the way, Mako!

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.220
An obstacle! Move inside.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.650
Not bad.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.790
He's not like other racers. He's still with us.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.990
Good. There's more to look forward to.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.990
I wonder how long he can keep it up?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.760
We're just getting started.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.010
<i>Man, I'm not racing.</i>

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.480
<i>I'm just "riding" the race,</i>

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.810

<i>But if I fall behind, I won't be able to catch up.</i>

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.460
<i>Stay close!</i>

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.560
<i>I never realized that course</i>
<i>knowledge was so important.</i>

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.340
<i>Losing my focus would mean</i>

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.710
<i>crashing into a wall or falling off a cliff.</i>

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.660
No wonder people are talking
about that Eight-Six lately.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.060
We can't shake him off easily.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.160
He is about to experience the
terror of Usui's severe turns.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.260
--Narrow right turn ahead!
--Okay!

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.450
<i>She's fast! Damn!</i>

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.850
<i>But I gotta stay close!</i>

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.550
<i>If she can, I can!</i>

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.240
Takumi said that if she could make
it around the corners, so could he.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.140
That's exactly what he said.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.480
That's an unbelievably childish idea.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.650
What's wrong with his head?

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.150
But it's amazing that he said that.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.820
Someone with lesser abilities
wouldn't think that.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.790
He can probably control his run

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.130
if he doesn't go beyond his limitations.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.330
Of course he can!

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.830
But he's racing against Mako,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.670
who knows everything there is
to know about this course.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.170
I'm sure she enters each
corner as fast as possible

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.680
so Takumi will have to do the same,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.340
even though he knows
nothing about this course.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.250
I get chills just thinking about it.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.360
Yeah, it demands both
technique and true courage.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.030
One mistake...

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.000
...and he's finished.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.010
<i>He's racing a Sileighty...</i>

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.480
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.300
He's right behind me!

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.170
Why? Am I not going fast enough?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.070
No, you're doing great, Mako.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.810
But he's on me!

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.410
Don't worry about him,
or you'll mess up your rhythm.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.150
Leave what's going on behind us to me.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.150
It's only just started.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.820
Let's enjoy this awesome race!

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.820
Right. I trust you.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.260
Just believe in your partner!

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.390
You and I are the fastest team in Usui!

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.070
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:35.580
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.680
It's a "sudden-death death match."

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.780
With this rule, you should go in front first.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.290
It won't end with one race,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.260
but at least you get one practice.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.250
It's better to lose in the second race.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.960
I'll chase her first.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.630
Think it over, Takumi!

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.900
This is my race, so let me decide.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.210
<i>I'm in trouble.</i>

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:14.050
<i>I chose to chase her 'cuz I didn't</i>
<i>want her chasing me, but...</i>

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.950

Maybe it's over.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.950
It's not over until they come back.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.360
This race is one-sided,
no matter how you look at it.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.360
But, Iketani...

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.130
He's never had a race
that's been favorable for him.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.970
Nakazato's R32 was monstrous.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:53.070
And the duct tape death match
was Takumi's first try.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.640
But Takumi always had one friend...

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.480
Akina Pass.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.220
The pass that he drove every day for years.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.120
Does the location make that
much difference, though?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.790
If he had driven here a few times,

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.250
it might have been different,
but this is his very first time here.

What the heck was that girl
doing sitting next to Mako?

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.950
How should I know?

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.750
I noticed that, too.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.420
This is a race, but she
went in as if it was normal.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.430
I don't know the details.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.330
All I know is that they're best friends,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.170
and from the beginning,
they were always analyzing

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.930
and developing their technique together.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.180
Isn't she like a rally navigator?

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.820
--That makes it worse for Takumi.
--Yeah.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.050
No way! He won't lose!

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.320
But with a good navigator,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.490
Mako can concentrate fully on driving.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.670
Obstacle ahead!

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.790
--Avoid it and cut inside!
--Yeah.

<i>He keeps up with our fast pace...</i>

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.800
<i>...as if Mako's best isn't fast enough.</i>

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.700
<i>He's good!</i>

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.970
Mako, C-121 is coming up.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.800
We'll shake him off there!

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.940
We'll drift from the very beginning.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.280
Let's show him what we're made of

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.450
at Usui's most difficult turn.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.480
Got it. That's right!

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.750
I'll show him how drifting should be done!

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.450
No one else has ever
cleared the turn at full speed.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.180
Are Mako and Sayuki here tonight?

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.920
I haven't seen them yet.

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:30.020
I wanna see the Sileighty's drift.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.860
Here at C-121 is the best place for it.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.960
'Cuz it's really hard.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.130
It's the hardest.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.470
You're considered an advanced racer here

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.140
if you can drift through this turn.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.310
Advanced in Usui means the best anywhere.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:51.610
--Yeah.
--If you don't have the
courage to come in fast,

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.820
you won't have enough
speed to drift to the end.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.850
All the first-timers mess it up.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.160
But some can actually do it, right?

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.820
A few.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:08.360
But only Mako's Sileighty
does it at full speed.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.530
I don't know how fast she goes,

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.700
but no one else has managed it yet.

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.010
Someone is coming down.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.980
Hear that squealing? They're coming in fast!

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.820
There!

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.650
--The Sileighty!
--It's Mako and Sayuki!

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:35.820
Who's following them?

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.720
Are they racing?!

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.560
An Eight-Six?!

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.410
No cars ahead!

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.950
Make it flashy, Mako!

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.180
--Yeah!
--Go!

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.190
They're in the turn!

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.280
That fool came into the turn
at the same speed as Mako!

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.410
Doesn't he know how difficult C-121 is?!

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.370
Courage alone won't let him clear the corner!

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.330
<i>He has guts, following Mako into this corner.</i>

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.970
<i>But at this speed, there's no turning back.</i>

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:57.970
<i>C-121's exit narrows severely.</i>

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:03.140
<i>There is only one ideal line to the exit,</i>
<i>though there seem to be others.</i>

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.950
Can you find it, your first time on this course?

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.710
He couldn't have!

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.690
--He cleared it.
--Unbelievable.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.990
Who's that Eight-Six?

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:52.990
Could he be... the famous
Eight-Six of Mount Akina?

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.290
I have goose bumps!

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.830
<i>What just happened?</i>

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.470
<i>Four-wheel drift at full speed</i>

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.970
<i>is ranked as "Ultra D" difficulty.</i>

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.480
<i>Even Mako missed the</i>
<i>ideal line by three inches.</i>

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.420
<i>But he was right on it.</i>

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.090
<i>We can't win. We chose a</i>
<i>monster as our opponent.</i>

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.720
No! You can't swing that much here!

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.290
You couldn't have told me that sooner?

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.890
What's wrong? Focus! This isn't like you!

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.190
Can't you tell, Mako?

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.230
That Eight-Six is unreal.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.300
He's way out of our league.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.240
What happened to your usual stubbornness?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.870
It's not even over and you're giving up?

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.080
Not me!

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.740
I guess I am...

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.980
Fine! I didn't know you were a quitter.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.380
I'll do it myself!

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.960
We already knew how great he was.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.560
But since this is my last race...

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.970
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.640
What are you, scared?!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.810
You're useless!

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.680
You're nothing but dead weight.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.610
--Dead weight?!
--You're freight,

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.480
messing up the power-to-weight ratio!

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.490
<i>She gets tough behind the wheel!</i>

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.850
I'm not freight!

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.160
I'm not fat! I have a nice body!

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.630
Forty-nine kilograms of extra weight!

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.990
I weigh 47!

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.630
Fine, I've got my pride, too!

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.540
Ready, Mako?

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.540
We'll put our lives on the line!

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:21.440
Welcome back!

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.210
All right. Enter the next turn so
you almost scrape the inside wall!

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.440
Got it!

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.630
<i>Not bad.</i>

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:53.160
<i>I improved while recklessly chasing her.</i>

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.150
<i>I can feel the rhythm now!</i>

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.310
<i>I'm synched in!</i>

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.490
<i>Not many corners left now...</i>

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:12.230
<i>I'll just have to attack</i>
<i>each corner as well as I can!</i>

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.560
<i>I want no regrets.</i>

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.000
<i>My pride as Usui's fastest is on the line.</i>

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>Yokubou dake ni kararete miushinatteita</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>Kimagure na unmei wa</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>Mujaki na hitomi ni miserarete yuku</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku kimi o daite</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>Tatta hitotsu kono omoi o shinjitsu da to ieru</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Yorokobi o kanadeyou...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Kagayaku mirai e</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>Kazoe kirenai hodo tashikame aou</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Jounetsu yo eien e todoke</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku dakishimete</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Tatoe nani o ushinattemo</i>
<i>kono ude o hanasanai</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Utsukushiku karen ni sake...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>Kiseki no hana yo</i>

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.500
<i>Bunta, do you think Takumi has</i>
<i>a chance against the Sileighty?</i>

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500
<i>--Who knows?</i>
<i>--Who knows?!</i>

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.640
<i>I sell tofu, not predictions.</i>

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.170
<i>--I'll have Gunmo and Atsuage.</i>
<i>--I have seasoned that Eight-Six.</i>

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.710
<i>No one can touch it downhill.</i>

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.480
<i>It's up to the driver.</i>

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.580
<i>We'll see next week.</i>

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.320
<i>What if I bought Momen and Kinugoshi, too?</i>

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.320
<i>Next on Initial D: "Super Drift."</i>

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.190
<i>--It's a must-see.</i>
<i>--Don't miss it!</i>
