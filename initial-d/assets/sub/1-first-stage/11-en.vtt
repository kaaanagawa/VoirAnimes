<i>Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.340
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.540
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.410
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.750
<i>So many people in this world</i>

<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.540
<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.630
I mean, look at this Eight-Six
with its ugly wheels.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.100
It's embarrassing!

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.430
I'm crying!

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.040
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.060
It suits you well, though, kid!

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.410
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.020
That's it! They're gonna pay!

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.720
Here we go!

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.930
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.430
P... Please...

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.670
Take good care of my Eight-Five!

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.660 line:50 %
"Act 11: Shingo Arrives!"

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.740
It's not worth it, Takumi!

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.250
Ta... Takumi...

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.360
Slow down, Takumi!

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.820
You nailed it!

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.040
What the heck?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.950
Hey, that car's right on our tail!

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.050
It must be some Akina punk.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.880
You picked the wrong cars to tailgate!

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.590
I see...

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.680
Wanna play with us?

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.980
That's enough, Takumi!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.310
Stop the car!

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.020 line:50 %
"Curve ahead"

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.200
I said stop!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.560
Takumi!!

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.350
Unbelievable...

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.580
Is this really my Eight-Five?

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.160
He is not bad at all...

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.960
No way!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.500
Isn't that the Eight-Five?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.340
The one we saw at the pass?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.640
There's no way an Eight-Five
could keep up with us!

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.550
You're right! It's that Eight-Five!

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.580
Those punks lied to us!

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.990
It must be...

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.490
...an Eight-Six!

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.480
<i>Here it is!</i>

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.330
<i>What?</i>

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.660
<i>It won't accelerate down the hill at all...</i>

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.700
<i>And these wheels won't grip the road at all...</i>

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.280
Darn, he is so fast!

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.940
<i>This is so slow.</i>

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.180
<i>I guess it's time for that move.</i>

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.210
You won't pass me, no matter what!

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.310
What?!

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.420
What just happened?!

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.860
How did he pass me?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.700
That's not an Eight-Five.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.730
That's an Eight-Six!

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.260
A well-tuned Eight-Six...

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.370
What a big roll!

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.840
Was it...

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.000
...an Eight-Five?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.290
He went right through us.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.190
That Eight-Five was spooky!

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.890
Was it...

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.460
...a ghost?!

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.570
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.910
--Here.
--Thank you.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:36.020
Iketani told me... that your
downhill skills were abnormal.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.690
Abnormal?

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.490
I don't think so...

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.520
You just can't see it yourself.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.590
I never imagined that a car could run like that.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.400
You've changed my perception.
It was that shocking.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.770
I'm sorry it was so scary for you.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.910
No need for an apology, Takumi.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.450
I've never been this happy before!

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.650
Huh?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.790
I realized that it wasn't all
about the car's capabilities.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:17.690
If you have skills, you can even
maneuver an Eight-Five like that.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.130
I fell in love with my car!
I'll take good care of it.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.330
I'll train hard, starting tomorrow.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.540
I don't care if people laugh at me.

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.670
My Eight-Five is the best!

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:44.650
Hey, let's go for a drive with
a couple of girls next time!

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.560
--Sure...
--No blowing me off this time, okay?

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.230
--I mean it, Takumi!
--I promise.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.820
The ocean, the girls, the bikinis...here I come!

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.270
All right!!

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.520
My S13!

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:24.130
You came back to me... as handsome as ever.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.630
I'm going to cry...

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.890
--Are you trying to run over me, Itsuki?
--All right!!

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.670
We'll start training today!

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.540
We'll practice drifting with lower-grade tires.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.640
Count me in, too!

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.840
Check out this cool sticker!

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.810
What...?!

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.350
It's all right, isn't it?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.320
Yeah, sure, not bad...

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.420
Now I'm officially a member
of Team Speed Stars!

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.490
--The sticker looks crooked.
--Take it off...

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.400
I should practice before I forget Takumi's
downhill techniques from last night.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.200
What?! He let you in his Eight-Six?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.870
He sure did...

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.670
...though it wasn't the Eight-Six.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.670
What's with the meaningful laugh?

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.840
--Confess, Itsuki!
--Should I tell you?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.580
--Wanna drink gasoline?
--Okay, I'll tell you!

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.550
Well, he drove my Eight-Five

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.750
at the Akina downhill last night.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.760
It was beyond my imagination!

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.090
I've never seen anything like it!

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.930
Even way before a corner,
we were drifting sideways.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.370
All I could see was the blur
of scenery in the windshield.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.240
It was miraculous!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.600
He drifted with your Eight-Five?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.940
It doesn't even have LSD!

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.040
It was so quick.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.040
We passed two jerks back to back

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.380
at the downhill hairpin turns.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.780
I've never felt so alive!

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.220
Do you believe him, boss?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.260
I know Takumi is good, but with an Eight-Five?

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.490
It's hard to believe that any driver

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.730
could do that in an Eight-Five.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.770
I know it's hard to believe,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.270
but I saw what I saw.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.610
If Itsuki is telling the truth,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.110
that means that Takumi's adaptability

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.710
is far beyond what I imagined.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.050
Since they both have the same body,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.520
maybe they have similar maneuverability?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.950
I doubt that.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.950
That Eight-Five is a joke,

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.590
compared to the Eight-Six Bunta has built

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.530
and modified over the years.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.430
A joke?!

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.930
You mean, Takumi can
drive pretty much any car?

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.740
Just as long as they have the FR layout,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.910
he can bring out their full potential.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.750
Not just anyone can drive an Eight-Six.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.880
You have to have mastered
the basic skills to drive one.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.350
Bunta used to say...

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.320
"An Eight-Six trains the driver."

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:39.690
That car... had a Night Kids sticker on it.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.090
It had street racing written all over it.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.190
You can totally tell modified cars from others

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.560
by looking at how they run.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.030
Yeah.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:55.200
Lately, those Night Kids come to Akina a lot.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.940
What do they want?

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.980
Well, since their leader Nakazato lost,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.550
I don't think anyone from their team

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.070
will come out for a rematch.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.100
I almost feel bad for him.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.270
Now that Takeshi has lost to that Eight-Six,

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.270
he can't act all invincible anymore.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.000
May I help you?

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.440
--Two coffees.
--Sure.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.510
I heard that the Eight-Six driver
in the Speed Stars is just a kid.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.250
I don't know how good this kid is...

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.920
...but when I beat that Eight-Six,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.620
I'll be better than Takeshi.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.860
I'll be the fastest one in Night Kids.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.360
I don't know, Shingo.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.530
I know you're fast downhill,

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:56.560
but I've heard this kid is abnormal.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.300
I know I can take him fair and square,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.300
but I have a more interesting idea,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.310
which will ensure my victory.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.810
Wha...?!

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:12.680
You'll see. I'll show him an
impressively dangerous downhill.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.850
The world only needs one downhill specialist.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:19.690
The Eight-Six is outdated.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:24.590
I'll make sure to send it to a scrap yard.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.530
Wha...

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.760
Shingo Shoji of Night Kids...

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.200
...is the fastest downhill racer in Gunma.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.360
Where is Ryosuke?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.030
My brother is locked in his room,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.630
staring at his computer screen.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.730
He sure likes doing that.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.900
He's the only street racer in Gunma

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.530
who trains by staring at a computer screen.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.380
I wonder what would happen if my brother

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.380
and the Eight-Six of Mount Akina raced?

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.880
There is no way Ryosuke would lose to him.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.760
Ryosuke knows all about that Eight-Six now.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.430
I'm sure he has all the data he needs

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.870
to create a simulation of
a winning race in his head.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.770
No street racer knows more
about cars than my brother.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.940
I can't imagine him losing,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.180
considering his exceptional skills.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.180
Well, then...

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.020
But that Eight-Six won't lose, either.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.290
That high-speed drifting...

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.990
...and his delicate brake control.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.960
He's exceptional, too.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.560
As a fellow FR driver,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:14.540
I may have fallen for the
way that Eight-Six runs.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.040
Keisuke...

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.640
If they race, one will lose.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.180
I don't want my brother to lose,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.210
but I don't want to see
that Eight-Six lose, either.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.410
Strange, isn't it?

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.590
Oh, sorry!

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.660
--Did you get wet?
--No.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.160
--Hold on...
--Sure.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.320
Why don't we go somewhere together again?

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:45.930
We can go to the mountains,

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.940
or the highlands, or the ocean.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.200
--We're on summer vacation!
--Yeah...

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.080
Let's make a lot of memories!

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.350
We should.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.880
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.010
...on an overnight trip.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.030
When is your next day off? This Sunday?

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.700
It depends, really...

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.230
Do you want to take me for a drive again then?

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.040
--With that car?
--Yeah.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.150
No blowing me off this time, Takumi!

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.090
Do you mind if Itsuki joins us?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.420
The three of us?

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.430
I was hoping...

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.830
...you could find someone for him.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.400
Yeah...

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.000
He's a good guy, but he's shy.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.370
I didn't know you were so thoughtful.

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:02.310
I just thought it would be good for him...

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.150
Thank you very much!

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:09.550
Sure, I'll ask around.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.790
Thanks.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.220
I'm sure I'll find someone perfect for Itsuki.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.090
That was awesome!

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.320
Maybe I should try it, too.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.060
I'm getting the hang of
moving the rear sideways.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.260
It's all about the timing.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:02.470
You pull the emergency brake to start the drift.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.200
But, Iketani...

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.040
I didn't see Takumi pull the emergency brake

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.140
even once the other night.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.380
Takumi uses the foot pedal brake

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.120
to shift the weight.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.950
Don't worry, you're a long way from that!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.050
Yeah...

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.160
We usually go into a
corner and then accelerate

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.990
to skid the rear tires right before coming out,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.530
but that's an elementary
technique called Power Slide

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.400
and is not a true drift.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:38.240 line:50 %
"Keiichi Tsuchiya's Drift Lesson"

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.870
Takumi drifts into a corner
and controls the skid at the end

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.740
to stabilize the car--a true drift.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:44.480
That's the fastest way to turn,
and it looks good, too.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:48.480
I see. You've done some research.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.020
I was bored while my S13 was in the shop,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.590
so I read some books.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.330
I wanna try the sidespin, too.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
I'm so excited!

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.230
I think I'm ready for the next step.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.070
Instead of a straight line,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.270
I'll try it in a low-speed turn.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.030
Good luck, Iketani!

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.410
Watch out for other cars!

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.400
