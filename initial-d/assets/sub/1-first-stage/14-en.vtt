Takumi?!

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.880
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.150
Don't let him drag you into it.
This whole thing is ridiculous!

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.780
Don't do it, Takumi!

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.840

What? Takumi is doing
the duct tape death match?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.640
That's definitely not a good idea.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.840
He snapped because of Itsuki.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.980
I understand his feelings, but it's reckless.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.020
Today is Saturday. Where is Takumi?

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.850
He's off today,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.490
and Itsuki is in the hospital,
so we're short-handed.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.490
I know Takumi is good,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.330
but I don't know about
a duct tape death match.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.530
After work, I'll go convince him not to do it.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.700
We gotta make him stop.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.870
Yeah.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.040
Mind helping me out a little?

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.120
<i>No one can stop him now.</i>

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.020
<i>What if we let him?</i>

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.010
<i>No. It's too risky against an FF.</i>

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.430
I was surprised. This is the
first time you've called me.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.910
I've been upset about something.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.440
I was thinking, and suddenly thought of you.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.380
Somehow I felt relaxed...

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm glad you called.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.390
How is Itsuki, by the way?

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.490
He was wearing a seatbelt
and isn't as bad as he looks,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.120
but they still have to do some more tests.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.930
I should go see him.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.730

Oh, sorry!

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.280
You seem different.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.750

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.130
Hey, brother!

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.510
--What's wrong?
--The Eight-Six of Mount Akina

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.380
took the duct tape death match challenge

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.850
from the Night Kids' Number Two.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.850
--What?
--His opponent is an EG6.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.180
What's he thinking?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.520
A duct tape death match is an FR killer.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.860
It's common sense that it heavily favors an FF.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.560
It's common sense...

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.960
...but he is racing.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.630
When he races, common sense
goes out the window.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.970
Should we check it out?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.080
Hello...?

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.310
We're closing. The fried tofu is all sold out.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.420
No, we didn't come for... is Takumi home?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.750
Takumi?

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.590
He took the Eight-Six and left this afternoon.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.750
No idea where he went.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.070
Bunta... have you done a
duct tape death match before?

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.500
Yeah, a long time ago.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.940
What if Takumi did it?

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.270
Takumi?

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.680
Well, he's still a beginner,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.080
so he might end up going down the cliff.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.920
Let's look other places, Iketani.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.020
Yeah.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.050
Sir, if he comes home,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.220
please convince him not to do it.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.950
Thank you very much.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.870
A duct tape death match...

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.550
Let's get going, Shingo.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.080
Yeah.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.240
<i>Don't worry, Eight-Six of Mount Akina.</i>

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.910
<i>The victory is 100% mine.</i>

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.000
<i>You'll end up at the bottom of the cliff.</i>

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.640
I'll see you.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.760
Call me, okay?

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.450
Sure.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.760
Now...

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.550
A lot of people are here.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.550
I was hoping for a small crowd.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.890
After all, we came to talk him out of it.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.220
Here come the Night Kids!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.650
I only see you and your slow S13.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.220
Where is the Eight-Six?

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.890
Ignore him.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.390
I wonder where Takumi is?

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.660
It's almost time. He should
be here any minute.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.400
Here comes the Eight-Six of Mount Akina!

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.890
Fujiwara Tofu Shop?

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.920
What is this?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.230
Takumi, it's not too late.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.740
Don't do this ridiculous race!

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.140
Why?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.310
I won't lose to someone like him.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.550
He drives an FF! Don't you know that?

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.710
Wait... you're the punk from the other night.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.980
You wasted my time.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.490
What are you babbling about?

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.590
I hope you're not discussing backing down.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.550
Iketani, I'm doing this no matter what.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.170
It's 10:00...

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.660
It's almost starting.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.680
I believe in you, Takumi. You can win.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.580
Please win!

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.600
Will he be okay?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.500
Shouldn't we have stopped him by force?

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.700
All we can do now is believe in him.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.200
It's set.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.710
They've set up the finish line.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:13.110
It's time to start.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.840
Okay.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.620
I'll count down! Ten seconds...

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.120
Eight... Seven... Six...

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.120
Five... Four...

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.160
Three... Two... One...

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.720
Go!

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.900
It's started...

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.840
Stay calm, Takumi.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.850
Shingo purposely eased up on
the gas pedal to stay behind.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.550
So that he can watch the
Eight-Six go down the cliff.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.220
No human can drive an FR under
this rule without crashing it.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.820
That Eight-Six won't last three corners.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.270
<i>Don't be cocky.</i>

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.600
<i>The B-16A engine is the best there is.</i>

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.610
<i>If I wanted, there's no way</i>

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.580
<i>I'd be behind a 4A-G engine at the start.</i>

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.670
<i>I just wanna see how many</i>
<i>corners you can clear.</i>

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:15.330
But I wonder if he can really
make any of those corners?

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.060
Here they come!

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.970
Hey, isn't that Eight-Six coming in too fast?

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.310
This could get ugly.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.910
<i>Aren't you going slower than usual?</i>

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.330
<i>You're enthusiastic,</i>

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.030
<i>but aren't you forgetting something?</i>

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.640
<i>Here it goes... it's over.</i>

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.810
<i>I pulled it out. I'm lucky.</i>

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.640
<i>I thought I was gonna sprain my wrist.</i>

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.150
He regained control!

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.920
Wow! I was sure he'd lost it.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.360
I'm too old for this.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.000
Hey, hey, what happened to your enthusiasm?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.190
I can't just stand here.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.860
Let's follow them!

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.530
I don't think so, Iketani...

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.400
With our skills, we won't catch up with them.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.470
I'm not trying to catch up with them.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.740
In case something bad happens to Takumi,

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.140
we can reach him quicker.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.200
Hey, wait for me!

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.980
I'm getting the hang of this.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.030
<i>How is he...?</i>

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.130
<i>He continues to clear the</i>
<i>corners with little counter.</i>

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.830
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:13.670
<i>A duct tape death match</i>
<i>can't be mastered instantly.</i>

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.340
<i>The safer you try to go,</i>

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:20.740
<i>the deeper you sink-- just like an ant-lion trap.</i>

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.910
<i>I had to train myself for hours</i>
<i>before I finally mastered</i>

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.910
<i>cornering with my right hand</i>
<i>duct-taped to the wheel.</i>

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.360
<i>On a straight line, engine power is crucial.</i>

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.370
<i>No NA 10-6DOHC engine in the world</i>

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.860
<i>can out-perform the B-16A.</i>

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.380
<i>The sound of revving up to the red zone...</i>

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.850
<i>It's ecstasy! It's to die for!</i>

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.370
<i>You see? I can pass you whenever I want.</i>

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.870
<i>Maybe you should panic a little.</i>

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.070
<i>Let's get going!</i>

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.140 line:50 %
"Skate Center"

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.080
My heart speeds up before each corner

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.950
with anticipation that the crushed Eight-Six

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.450
may suddenly appear.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.060
Hey, don't say that!

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.630
I'm sure it'll end without any disaster...

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.830
Yeah, but...

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.660
...Takumi's abilities surprise me every time.

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.990
<i>I can keep the speed up nicely...</i>

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.980
<i>It's faster not to steer</i>
<i>too much when cornering...</i>

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.500
<i>Darn, why?</i>

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.640
<i>He's unaffected by my pressure.</i>

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.310
<i>He was unstable at the beginning,</i>

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.470
<i>but he gets sharper as we go.</i>

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.650
They'll be here soon.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:47.650
It sounds like both are still in one piece.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.490
If he couldn't reach this spot,
I'd be wrong about him.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:55.360
That Eight-Six wouldn't be a worthy target.

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.960
There!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.000
Oh, no! Someone is coming up!

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.650
He four-wheel drifted through one lane

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.990
without crossing the center line.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.590
What technique!

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.360
He did it like it was nothing.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.700
He didn't panic about passing by a car, either.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.530
Is his hand really taped to the wheel?

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.770
Maybe it came off a long time ago.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:40.670
Perhaps he adapted to the situation quickly.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.080
You mean...

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.880
You can attack a corner

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.680
by shifting the weight without steering.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.780
He learned that quickly.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.220
He's unreal.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.950
Without a doubt, he is evolving.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.630
<i>Darn, what a fake!</i>

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.530
<i>It'll be hard to label him</i>
<i>as a fake if he keeps that up.</i>

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.040
<i>But I'm not like Nakazato.</i>

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.870
<i>All I have to do is win, no matter what it takes.</i>

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.550
<i>Don't feel bad.</i>

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.950
<i>The Eight-Six of Mount Akina</i>
<i>will simply turn into metal junk.</i>

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.970
Wow! After a spin, he turned 360 degrees

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.170
and started driving again
as if nothing ever happened.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.810
<i>He got lucky. Pure luck.</i>

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:31.390
<i>Darn, he would've been done</i>
<i>had it been a high-speed corner.</i>

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.690
<i>That's all right. The victory is mine anyway.</i>

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.660
<i>I hate that you're still going,</i>

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.160
<i>but I'm too familiar with</i>
<i>the rules to lose this race.</i>

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.030
<i>I'll leave you behind.</i>

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.190
<i>I'm pissed off! He did that on purpose.</i>

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.350
<i>I refuse to lose to scum like you!</i>

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.430
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.460
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.030
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.100
<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.900
<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.100
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.570
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.970
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.940
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Sekai ga kowaretemo kawaranai</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:23.960
<i>Beasty shout, dare no te ni sae oenai</i>

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:31.340
<i>Hageshii yume jikan sae mo ima koeteku</i>

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.340
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:43.480
<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.350
<i>Rage your dream, michi o hiraiteku</i>

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.020
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.030
<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.190
<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:56.030
<i>Hokori mau haishachi ni hau</i>

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.000
<i>Rikutsu dake no nougakitachi</i>

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.970
<i>Jamakusai kara shikato shitekou</i>

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>Streaker satte yuku street no mukou</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.440
<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.450
<i>Ai mo kako mo furimukazu</i>

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Yukeru anata kagayaiteiru</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, ima o ikiteiru</i>

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.700
<i>I won't forgive him...</i>

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.570
<i>I don't want to lose to him...</i>

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.070
<i>Is that you, Takumi?</i>

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.740
<i>I won't forgive him...</i>

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.740
<i>I don't want...</i>

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.040
<i>...to lose to him!</i>

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:45.710
<i>Anyhow...</i>

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.150
<i>Next on Initial D...</i>

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:49.850
<i>"Takumi's Fury!"</i>

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.980
<i>I won't lose...</i>

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.020
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
