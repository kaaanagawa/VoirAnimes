<i>We newborn travelers</i>

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.540
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.750

<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.540
<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.090
That punk!

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.360
Hey, you!

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.530
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.430
Are you kidding me?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.040
--That was your fault.
--What?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.870
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.480
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.880
I tried to brake, but... bump.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.320
What did you say?!

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.690
Calm down, Iketani!

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.520
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.660
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.060
What do you mean, "your" rules?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.900
It's nothing.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.040
We call it the "duct tape death match."

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.570
Duct tape death match?

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.510
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.350
Tell this Eight-Six kid

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.220
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.580
I'll see you then.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.310
I think that punk just challenged you, Takumi.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.240
He didn't recognize your face, though.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.010
Go for it, Takumi!

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.210
Duct tape or whatever...

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.150
Beat that jerk badly and
make him beg for forgiveness!

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.980
It sounds too risky, Itsuki.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.020
He can't steer in this race.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.690
But, Iketani...

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.360
Takumi beat the FD and the R32.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.360
His little rule won't make any difference.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.030
I'm sure he's been practicing a lot this way.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.530
Takumi, it's too risky.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.660
Don't take the bait.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.040
I have no desire to, really...

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.170
Good for you. Just ignore him.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.720 line:50 %
"Act 13: First Date"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.340
What? A duct tape death match?

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.510
--Yeah.
--That's reckless.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.910
Is Takumi...?

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.880
As usual, he's calm and unexcited.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.820
He's not into it at all.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.350
I want him to do it!

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.020
It would be so refreshing to beat that jerk

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.320
and make him apologize!

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.020
He drives a Civic, the rival
of the Levin and the Trueno.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.540
In my day, we raced in a variety
of ways under different rules,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.380
but the duct tape death match was
one of the most dangerous ones.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.850
Is it really that dangerous?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.910
It doesn't sound like it.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.280
Itsuki, get in your car and try it for yourself,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.280
then you'll understand.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.360
--Well...
--Okay.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.190
Don't let go of your right hand,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.860
and steer all the way to either side.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.390
Sure.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.070
This is as far as it goes!

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.310
Leave the wheel there and come out.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.870
Okay.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.880
See how much you steered.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.350
Sure.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.820
What?! This is it?!

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.480
I steered as far as I could.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.690
See?

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.520
How can you turn corners like this?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.890
Let alone drive the pass...

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.660
Steering can only be used to initiate the turn.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.360
You have to turn by sliding the rear tires.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.870
--All the corners.
--What?!

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.040
But Takumi is a drift expert, so he can manage.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.040
It's not that easy.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.710
You can't counter,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.010
which makes it harder to control the drift.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.410
Oversteering means a spin,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.090
but if you go "under" into
a turn, that'll be the end.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.890
This rule definitely favors an FF driver.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.960
--He drives an EG6, right?
--Yes.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.030
Its accelerator eliminates oversteering,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.500
so he can attack corners at full speed.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.800
Its side brake also eliminates "under."

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800
But an FR such as the Eight-Six
needs to continuously drift

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.740
through a narrow area as if
walking on a tightrope...

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.640
It's better to avoid it.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.650
<i>Darn...</i>

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.590
<i>Talk like this may trigger his interest.</i>

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.850
Uh, boss?

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.980
--Isn't that Kenji?
--Oh...

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.560
Iketani...

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.100
I did a little research on
that punk from the other day.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.670
He's Shingo Shoji of the Myogi Night Kids.

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.840
Shingo Shoji of the Night Kids...

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.110
He's their number two,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.840
but he's confident enough to call himself

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.110
the fastest downhill racer of the Night Kids.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.550
He'll stop at nothing to reach his goals,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.290
so he isn't popular with his teammates,

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.060
especially their leader, Nakazato.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.960
I see. That's why he's challenging Takumi.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.160
So that he can take over the Night Kids.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.900
He's been spreading a
rumor about this already.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.400
A rumor?

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.470
A rumor that the Speed Stars are scared

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.970
and avoiding Shingo's challenge.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.810
And he mentions nothing about duct tape.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.340
He's making us look bad.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.880
What a jerk!

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.420
He's trying to drag Takumi
into the race no matter what.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.750
Oh!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.550
Takumi...

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.990
I have no interest in racing him at all, really.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.360
That's good.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.840
You don't have to accept all the
challenges that come your way.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.740
--Forget about it.
--Yeah...

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.110
Whatever happened to
the race with the Eight-Six?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.110
I'm all ready to go.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.480
It's up to him now.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.150
Don't worry...

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.790
I'll drag him out, no matter what.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.690
Looks like it'll be an interesting race.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.860
Takeshi!

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.800
Shingo, I hear you're
planning something big...

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.630
Do what you want,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.870
but don't do anything to insult
the name of the Night Kids.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.010
What's so funny?

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:39.010
Isn't it you who has insulted our name?

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.550
What?

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.990
I wonder who lost to that obsolete Eight-Six...

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.320
...with a powerful R32?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.990
Shingo...

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.860
A loser should be off sulking somewhere.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.700
Still acting like a leader
and giving me a lecture...

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.330
You make me laugh.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.770
I'll avenge you, Nakazato.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.040
Be thankful.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.320
<i>Shingo, someday you'll find out...</i>

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.940
<i>...how fierce that Eight-Six is.</i>

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.490
Well, Takeshi is on the skids.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:26.790
He's pitiful, really.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.730
Shingo, you're the new
leader of the Night Kids.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.870
First, I have to send the Eight-Six
of Mount Akina to the scrap yard.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.860
Hello! This is Takeuchi...

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.430
Is this Saori?

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.860
Itsuki?

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.670
Of course, I remember you.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.900
Yeah. A drive to Akina Lake?

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.340
Okay.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.510
Really?!

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.610
I'll meet you at that bus stop at 1:00, then.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.580
Yeah, bye!

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.760
Yeah! I just put an end to years of no girlfriend!

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.890
I'll make it count!

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.440
Here you go.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:55.750
Hey, Dad...

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.620
What is it?

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.990
Is a duct tape death match...?

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.510
No, never mind.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.990
<i>A duct tape death match...</i>

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.420
Takumi...

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.750
You're good at driving cars.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.930
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.570
...on an overnight trip.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:50.300
<i>I'm very conscious of her lately...</i>

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:12.650
Thank you very much!

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.830
Where is Itsuki?

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.570
He was just washing his car...

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.730
Where did he go?

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.340 line:50 %
"Practice Guide"

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.010
I see, I see...

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.710
Is this where you were hiding?

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.380
Um, I, uh, was just resting...

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.890
It's rare to see you with a book.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.550
That's just, uh...!

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.260
Let's see: "Love Manual:

That book is just...

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:52.030
The reason you're reading
this book is because...

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.470
...you have a date?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.230
Yes!

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.810
Is it with that Saori girl you mentioned before?

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.810
What about me?!

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.510
I picked it up at a bookstore yesterday

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.010
and have been studying it.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.580
You seem to have very little
advice on things like this.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.680
That hurts, though you're
probably right about that.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.430
Things are easier nowadays.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.930
In my day, we had to feel our way through...

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:27.570
Let me see: "You should
have her by the third date.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.670
Create a romantic setting for your first kiss..."

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.010
I got that covered, boss!

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.540
So, like I mentioned before,

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.110
I would like to take a day off.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.550
That's why... Sure.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.210
I envy you, you little...

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.640
<i>I look cool!</i>

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.910
<i>I wonder where she is...?</i>

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.510
I'm here, Itsuki!

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.230
I'm so happy!

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.870
Welcome--

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.920
I don't need gas.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.290
I came to get the answer to my invitation.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.120
You did tell him, didn't you?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:01.060
Yeah. He said he had no interest in it.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.060
That's a laugh.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.330
I didn't know that the Eight-Six was a chicken.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.540
He can't be scared of a
duct tape death match, can he?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.840
That's all right. I'll make him want to do it.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.770
<i>So cute!</i>

"Ropeway Depot"

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.870
We street racers don't talk
about "turning" a corner.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.340
We "attack" it.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.270
Maybe I should get a license.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.780
Why not? I'll teach you how to drive.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.210
I'll think about it.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.220
Oh, wow, Mount Fuji of Akina!

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.480
It's so beautiful!

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.790
<i>Well, girls are suckers for romance...</i>

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.020
<i>The first kiss should be at a romantic setting...</i>

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.200
<i>The first kiss...</i>

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.700
<i>Now is perfect. Go for it, Itsuki!</i>

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.050
Wha...?!

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.690
Itsuki?!

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.450
Sorry...

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.040
Yeah...

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.800
<i>An awkward silence... What should I do?</i>

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:46.680
<i>I found you.</i>

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.370
<i>An EG6? He bumped me.</i>

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.860
<i>Am I going too slowly for him?</i>

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.180
<i>He's on my tail.</i>

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.050
<i>Darn, I can't look bad in front of Saori!</i>

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.450
Saori...

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.160
I gotta speed up.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.850
Hang on for a bit!

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.400
Stop, Itsuki!

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.900
This is a street race!

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.540
I can't stop now!

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.520
<i>I have to protect Saori...</i>

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.140
Listen up, Itsuki got in an accident!

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.770
--What?
--Where?

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.240
Akina Pass.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.080
They're at the city hospital.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.880
Can you head over there now?

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.480
Sure.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.570 line:50 %
"City Hospital"

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.720
Are you okay, Itsuki?

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.550
Iketani, Takumi!

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.320
So, what happened?

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.190
It's nothing. It's not as bad as it looks, really.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.430
They're keeping me here to
do some tests, just in case.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.170
Weren't you with Saori?

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.670
She only had a few scratches,
so she went home.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.840
I steered my best to
protect the passenger side.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.110
What happened to your Eight-Five?

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:27.380
I spun it well, so only the
trunk area was damaged.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.280
Okay, you're done.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.740
--Take care.
--Thank you very much.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.730
I was going down the pass

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.960
when an EG6 started tailgating me.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.900
An EG6? Was it him?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.740
Maybe. It was a red EG6.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.910
He pushed me from behind at a corner...

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.380
That punk did it again!

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.050
Darn...

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.380
I'll do it.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.420
Duct tape or whatever,
I'll accept the challenge!

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.150
Takumi, wait up!

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.890
Takumi?!

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.090
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.560
Don't let him drag you into it.
This whole thing is ridiculous!

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.200
Don't do it, Takumi!

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.220
I won't lose, no matter what.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>So no one intervenes</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.930
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>You tried to escape,</i>
<i>but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Something is within your grasp</i>
<i>and something is forgotten</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:24.000
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:31.370
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.520
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.390
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.060
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.060
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Reverberations left behind,</i>
<i>disappear to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Let's ignore the constraints of logic</i>

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.030
<i>'Cause they're a pain</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.170
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream,</i>
<i>continue on the unending road</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Don't look back on your love or your past</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.600
<i>Wasn't it wrong to involve Itsuki</i>

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.100
<i>and make him spin out like that, Shingo?</i>

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.000
<i>It's okay, as long as I can drag out the Eight-Six.</i>

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.400
<i>But...</i>

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.170
<i>Since I know for sure that I'll</i>
<i>beat him with the duct tape rule,</i>

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.510
<i>just winning isn't enough fun.</i>

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:45.010
<i>I'll give you a flashy show.</i>

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.850
<i>Next on Initial D, "Evolving Drift!"</i>

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.950
<i>I'll make sure he can taste</i>
<i>the fear of the downhill.</i>

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.890
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
