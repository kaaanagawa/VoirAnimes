Morning, Takumi!

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.630
What's with the sleepy face?

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.100
I was born with it.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.330
Hey, it's getting closer.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.480
The race against Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.550
I'm so excited that I can't focus on classes.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.050
We're talking about Ryosuke Takahashi,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.550
the fastest and most popular racer in Gunma.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.230
Do you have any special strategy, Takumi?

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.530
No.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.400
I'm not versatile enough to change
my race based on my opponents.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.630
It makes no difference.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.540
I just race the fastest way I know how.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.210
If the opponent is faster, I'll lose.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.740
Otherwise, I'll win.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.080
That makes sense.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.750
I'm counting on you, you know?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.090
What if you ended up beating him?!

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.990
That'd be so cool and awesome and...!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.360
How embarrassing!

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.000 line:50 %
"Act 24: Akagi's White Comet!"

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.660
Welcome!

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.840
Oh, it's just you.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.180
I got something very interesting.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.380
You mean you got an adult movie, Kenji?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.020
Sorry, Itsuki.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.580
This is better than that!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.880
Better than that?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.760
They're racing.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.430
It doesn't look like Akina.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.700
Just watch the tape.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.230
Can we watch that last part in slow motion?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.650
It's Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.650
He looks so much younger!

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.650
This was three years ago.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.490
How did you find this?

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.460
Some diehard fan videotaped his races.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.160
What a drift!

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.000
Angling into a corner like that is miraculous.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.760
So cool!

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.740
Hey, I was actually there for that race!

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.410
I still remember it.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.740
Back then, he was a lone wolf
and didn't belong to any team.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.180
They called him "Akagi's White Comet."

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.520
Akagi's White Comet...

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.120
That sounds so cool that I'm shivering.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.130
What about the Red Suns?

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.130
Ryosuke personally handpicked
a few premium street racers

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.930
to form the Red Suns.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.440
That's why the quality of
his team is much higher

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.110
than that of our "friendly" team.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.980
Now, he and his brother Keisuke

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.150
are known as "The Rotary Brothers."

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.820
But to me, he will always be
"Akagi's White Comet."

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.820
What are you guys watching?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.990
I'm sorry!

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.860
--Turn it off.
--It's okay.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.730
Keep watching.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.640
That's good stuff!

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.140
--Takumi's really racing him, huh?
--Yes.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.480
I bet it'll draw the biggest crowd ever.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.710
Ryosuke Takahashi is a superstar,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.020
and now Takumi has become
famous as "Akina's Eight-Six."

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.850
That's right. A mysterious downhill specialist

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.690
has suddenly appeared in Akina this summer!

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.360
I'm so excited!

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.660
Honestly, who do you think will win?

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.600
I hate to say this,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.270
but I don't think Takumi
stands a chance against him.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.940
This opponent is unreal.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.940
I have to agree.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.850
Ryosuke Takahashi is fast... ridiculously fast.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.080
That fast, huh?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.250
He was already the fastest then,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.460
but he's gotten even faster.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.090
On top of all the street races,
he's repeatedly won the Gymkhana

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.100
and various circuit competitions.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.600
He holds many course records
and has never lost a race.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.600
His undefeated streak is unbroken.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.570
And they say that he's never had
to give his all in any of his races.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.620
He only uses half his ability
and still defeats any opponent.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.950
So no one has ever really
seen his absolute best yet.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.930
Well, if Takumi can keep up
with him, it's a job well done.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.260
But...

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.130
There you go with your negativity again.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.170
Can't you be more optimistic?

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.440
Then who do you think will win, boss?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.930
Well...

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.620
Takumi has beaten Keisuke
and Night Kids' Nakazato!

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.490
And there was Usui's Sileighty
and the duct tape death match!

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.490
And a race in the rain!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.320
I think...

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.100
I think he'll do just fine.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.530
Ryosuke is by far the best racer
among the elite Red Suns.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.370
Keisuke and Nakazato don't even come close.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.940
To use a boxing analogy, the odds are 10 to 1.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.680
I want Takumi to win.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.950
He's my best friend,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.490
and I want our proud Eight-Six...

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.660
...to defeat the FC!

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.890
Stop crying.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.040
Boys like cars, don't they?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.370
Sure.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.640
Are cars that exciting?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.240
Sure they are.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.680
They can take you anywhere.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.550
If you had to choose between
your girlfriend and your car,

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.150
which would you pick?

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.150
I can't compare them.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.560
My girlfriend is one thing
and my car is another.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.600
Racing is very deep.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.930
I've been thinking about
how to get better at it.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.710
Thinking about that makes me feel good.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.710
You're...

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.080
--...sexual.
--Huh?!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.050
Where did that come from?!

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.050
Why do you say that?

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:42.350
Sorry, I just felt it.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.690
It's women's intuition.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.790
I'm pretty sure that I just got a peek...

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.560
...at your hidden sexuality!

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.030
What are you saying?
You're not making any sense.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.400
Don't worry. You wouldn't understand.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.710
When is the big race?

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.540
Two nights from tonight.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.380
Isn't it against a fast racer?

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.710
Yeah.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.980
I want to watch you race.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.480
But maybe I shouldn't.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.290
Don't crash.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:30.630
You can lose, but don't get hurt.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.400
You have to promise me that.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.190
Ryosuke, you got another invite
from a professional team.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.620
They called me today.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.020
Again? Wow.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.530
Which team?

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.830
It's the "Hoshiya"Team.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.500
They're looking for a young, premium racer.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.970
They want you to call them
right away to set up an interview.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.210
I know for sure that you'll make a great pro!

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.710
It's very exciting.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.680
What are you gonna do?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.880
Turn it down for me.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.130
Like I said before,
I have no desire to go pro.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.800
What a waste!

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.300
Can't you at least talk to them?

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.970
He's right, Ryosuke.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.840
I'm not interested in the
professional racing world.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.140
I'm only attracted to street racing,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.850
where anyone can freely express himself.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:58.150
The Gymkhana and circuit competitions

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.690
are the path I took to master street racing.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.530
Right now, there's only one thing on my mind.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.360
The Eight-Six on Saturday.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.240
Done working?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.440
Wanna go for a spin?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.410
--With you?
--Yeah.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.620
I've readjusted the car, so I
thought I'd go for an easy drive.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.450
An easy drive?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.620
I hate it when you talk like that.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.180 line:50 %
"Akina Skate Center"

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.630
--Hey, Bunta?
--Yeah?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.770
Did you readjust the car for the big battle?

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.470
That's right.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.910
I think I'll speed up a little, Yuichi.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.280
Hold on!

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.910
I'm ready. Just a little bit, okay?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.270
<i>Here comes the corner!</i>

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.120
<i>What entry speed!</i>

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.280
<i>I feel the G-force diagonally behind me.</i>

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.460
What the heck are you doing?!

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:51.370
I feel like having a smoke.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.600
Stop that!

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.940
Keep your eyes on the road!

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.780
Oh, no!

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.210
Not too bad.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.550
I'm serious this time!

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.690
Let me out!

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:40.180
The tires and engine are adjusted for the race.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.150
How much horsepower does it have now?

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:48.090
Well, I'd say its max is about 260 horsepower.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.420
260 horsepower?!

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.830
You downgraded it!

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.330
It had at least 350 before.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.360
It did.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.870
Less horsepower?

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.500
Why did you have to make it slower?

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.670
You should remember that, at times,

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.280
you need less horsepower to run faster.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.750
That's how deep street racing is.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.080
The key to downhill success
isn't power... it's balance.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.590
I thought I had adjusted my FC

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:24.460
to make it as fast as possible
both uphill and downhill.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.800
I knew I could handle
even more power downhill,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.230
so I upgraded the turbine
and raised the firing speed.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.770
But in the end, I had to lose all that power.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.440
Regardless of the reason,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.540
this downgrade was humiliating to me.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.540
I had to throw away my pride for this race.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.420
The Eight-Six is that tough of an opponent?

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.320
I'm lucky that I've met
such an extraordinary racer.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.060
My racer blood is boiling up.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.620
Let's go.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.580
<i>Less power, but fast!</i>

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.980
<i>He clears the corners faster.</i>

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.610
<i>There's no way my brother will lose to him now!</i>

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.790
<i>Right now, I'm not Ryosuke</i>
<i>Takahashi of the Red Suns.</i>

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.990
<i>I'm the lone wolf known as...</i>

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.430
<i>...Akagi's White Comet.</i>

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:41.160
<i>I'll win this battle, no matter what!</i>

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.180
Takumi!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.710
Hey!

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.820
--Race day is finally here!
--Yeah.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.320
It makes me angry, Takumi.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.320
Everyone thinks Ryosuke Takahashi will win.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:08.130
They say it's like a novice
fighting a heavyweight.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.960
Aren't you offended?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.030
Any plan for a big upset?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.060
Let me see...

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.400
No.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.260
<i>Those racers are headed to the pass.</i>

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.090
<i>It's finally here.</i>

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.830
--Boss?
--Yeah?

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.100
I've cleaned up outside.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.430
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.930
Good job.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.170
--You're going to the race, right?
--Yes.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.010
You still don't think Takumi can win?

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:58.050
No. I know he's exceptional,
but he's still in high school.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.950
He still has very little experience.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:05.590
I wonder how long he'll even
be able to stay in the race.

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:08.090
Not me.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.360
I actually think he has a chance.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.260
--Why?
--Because...

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.900
--Hey.
--Hey.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.270
I better hurry. Good night.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.970
Yeah.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.420
<i>The only reason I think Takumi has a chance...</i>

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.220
<i>...is that he's Bunta's son.</i>

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.090
<i>The son of that crazy Bunta...</i>

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.340
The crowd is gigantic, as expected.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.680
If I were Takumi, I would want to run away.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.810
I would be petrified in
front of all these people.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.120
--Isn't that Usui's Sileighty?
--Really?

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.130
I was right.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.770
--They're both cute.
--Yeah.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.440
How about around here?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.680
We may see some good tactics
at these complex corners.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.440
By the way, Mako...

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.110
...which one are you rooting for?

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.450
Which one?

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.450
The Eight-Six, right?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.460
Me, too.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.360
He has a mysterious charisma

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.830
that only those who have
raced him can recognize.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.330
You want to root for him
even though he beat you.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.840
Besides, he's...

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.470
...so cute! Right?

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.000
Come on, Sayuki.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.750
It's almost 9:30.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.650
This is it!

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.550
I'm so pumped up!

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:34.100
Here come the Red Suns.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.270
The Takahashi brothers are so cool!

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.240
--This is the enemy, eh?
--Ryosuke!

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.390
Ryosuke Takahashi is finally here.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.690
Now we wait for Takumi to show up.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.310
The Eight-Six is not here yet.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.880
I expected that.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.980
He always shows up at the very last minute.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:39.130
Keisuke...

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.000
I've been thinking about this for a long time,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.910
but when I lose a street race...

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.670
...I'll retire.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.180
What?! What are you saying?

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.750
You'll never lose.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.750
Just hear me out.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.190
By "retire," I don't mean quitting racing.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.620
I'll just step down from the number-one spot.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.590
I'll still continue to contribute to the team.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.360
What about our "fastest in Kanto" plan?

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.500
It can't happen without you!

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.830
Don't make a face.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:18.010
I have no intention of losing yet.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.610
Remember this, though...

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:26.110
It is inevitable that someday
I will lose to someone.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.020
By the way, there are only two racers

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.290
who I think could beat me one day.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.860
One of them is you, Keisuke.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.460
--Me?
--That's right.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:44.330
I see a racing genius within you.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.670
You'll be even faster one day.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.000
And the other is...

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.420
Takumi is here!

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.080
Yay, Takumi!

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:15.030
The other one is the Eight-Six, isn't it?

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.200
I won't lose to anyone just yet.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.000
Tonight, I'm ready for
my full-scale drift battle!

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>Yokubou dake ni kararete miushinatteita</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>Kimagure na unmei wa</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>Mujaki na hitomi ni miserarete yuku</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku kimi o daite</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>Tatta hitotsu kono omoi o shinjitsu da to ieru</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Yorokobi o kanadeyou...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Kagayaku mirai e</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>Kazoe kirenai hodo tashikame aou</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Jounetsu yo eien e todoke</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Sake bara no you ni akaku</i>
<i>tsuyoku, tsuyoku dakishimete</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Tatoe nani o ushinattemo</i>
<i>kono ude o hanasanai</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Utsukushiku karen ni sake...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>Kiseki no hana yo</i>

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.890
<i>What's wrong, Takumi?</i>

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:32.330
<i>I've been taking challenges as they come,</i>

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.140
<i>but this race seems very</i>
<i>different from the others.</i>

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.640
<i>--Yeah?</i>
<i>--My heart's pounding,</i>

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.470
<i>and I don't know what to do.</i>

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.340
<i>--Yeah?</i>
<i>--I find racing very fun and exciting.</i>

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.050
<i>--Yeah!</i>
<i>--I'm not sure how successful I'll be...</i>

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.720
<i>A very different Takumi is fired up!</i>

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.220
<i>Next on Initial D: "The Last Battle!"</i>

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.990
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
