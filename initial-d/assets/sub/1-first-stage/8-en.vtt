Look at that crowd!

More people here than at the FD run.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.050
The race between Takumi and
Nakazato is getting a lot of attention.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.420
What am I gonna do? I'm getting
more depressed by the minute.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.330
We are in no position to say it was a mistake.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.530
Takumi!

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.190
Please show up!

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.070 line:50 %

<i>Where the hell are you?!</i>

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.420
Could you win if it were you?

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.120
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.730
Do you think... I can win?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.040
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.140
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.240
You hear me?

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.010
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.180
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.870
<i>A coward?!</i>

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.490
--Wow!
--Here they come.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.860
--The Night Kids!
--It's Nakazato's R32!

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.740
It's amazing!

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.610
The black R32 is like a champion of the street.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.520
So these are the Night Kids.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.010
They sure came in with a big group!

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.760
K... Kenji!

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.260
We'd better start apologizing soon.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.730
Well... but...

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.870
There's still time before 10:00.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.240
Let's go talk him into it.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.500
--What?
--What?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.210
I don't think it's such a good idea

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.010
to drag Takumi into a losing battle.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.250
We'll never know until they actually race.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.350
Of course he'll lose.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.880
It's obvious if you're thinking clearly!

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.690
He's going to race the R32!

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.190
He can't match its power,
and it's got 4WD ATTESA E-TS!

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.000
I thought the same at first.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.200
But since I've been here, I've started
thinking there may be a chance.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.340
Of course, if this was the circuit,
the Eight-Six couldn't win.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.840
But this is a mountain pass!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840
This is the pass Takumi has been
running for the last five years.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.180
Nobody knows what's going to happen.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.110
When Takumi drives the Eight-Six,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.380
it's no longer an ordinary Eight-Six.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.050
It turns into a super machine
with infinite fighting power!

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.130
I know, because I have been
in the car when he's driving...

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.630
Takumi's driving is far better
than anything we've ever imagined.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.130
You mean that time when you fainted
after three corners down the hill

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.400
with your death wails
echoing through Mt. Akina.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.510
His downhill driving is that crazy!

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.310
There should be one other
person who feels the same way.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.020
Wh... Who is that?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.490
There is one other person who
got a good look at his driving.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.220
Are... Are you trying to say...?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.880
That's right!

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.430
Keisuke Takahashi of the Red Suns!

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.900
Here come the Takahashi Brothers!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.000
--Now we have more stars!
--It's so exciting!

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.240
Keisuke!

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.940
My dear Ryosuke!

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.410
You look great!

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.750
They have groupies now 'cause they're cool.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.840
Damn it! Racers should be
admired for their skills.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.190
--I'm no match for them either way.
--I'm no match for them either way.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.290
On top of that, they're rich.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.400
I knew they would be here!

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.690
I'm looking forward to seeing

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.330
how this race turns out.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.760
Watch closely!

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.930
I'll show you who the fastest man in Gunma is!

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.430
Not the Eight-Six or the Takahashi Brothers...

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.770
It's me! Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids!

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.170
Bastard!

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.180
Looks like the Eight-Six isn't here yet.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.450
In that case,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.180
we have to persuade Takumi no matter what.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.880
All right...

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.320
Get in!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.120
Itsuki! What's wrong?

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.460
I'll... stay, Iketani...

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.500
I can't face Takumi...

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.170
Okay.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.470
Wait here until the last possible minute, Itsuki!

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.810
I'll bring him, no matter what!

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.150
<i>I'm sure that Takumi is coming.</i>

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.980
<i>But still...</i>

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.390
--Ryosuke! Dear Keisuke!
<i>--What a nice place I'm in!</i>

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.020
I might make a habit of this!

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.500
Ryosuke! Wait!

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:56.700
Ryosuke, honey!

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.450
<i>What's going on? I'm so tense I could die.</i>

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.450
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.950
<i>I'm not really sure if I love</i>
<i>driving that much, but...</i>

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.800
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.730
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.840
<i>I want to see how much I'm capable of.</i>

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.640
<i>Everyone says that the GT-R is really fast,</i>

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.510
<i>so I want to challenge it</i>
<i>with everything I've got.</i>

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.150
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.050
<i>I can't stop thinking about racing,</i>
<i>even though I don't have a car.</i>

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.510
<i>On the contrary, I want to</i>
<i>race more every second.</i>

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.400
My stupid dad!

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.090
Where the hell did you go?

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.990
Oh!

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.140
Takumi!

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.300
Iketani!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.150
What?!

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.350
Your father has taken the car?

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.560
Yeah...

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.530
You have no idea where he might be?

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.230
I thought he might be at some bar,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.070
and I called every bar I know.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.140
You couldn't find him?

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.740
Uh-uh...

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.470
What the hell...?!

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.740
If you don't have the Eight-Six,
there's no use talking about it.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.310
This is really unexpected.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.680
Iketani, did you come here
to talk me into racing?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.190
Kind of, yeah.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.590
People are making a big
deal over this at the pass!

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.520
Nakazato of the Night Kids

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.030
and the Takahashi Brothers
are stirring up the crowd.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.500
But despite all that...
you are the star today, Takumi!

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.700
Wait a minute! Please...

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.370
...don't give me a hard time.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.110
Still... you haven't changed your mind?

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.570
It's not that.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.710
To tell you the truth, I wanted to go.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.450
--What?!
--What?!

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.450
But without the car, what can I do?

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.520
I was very depressed until you arrived.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.860
Gee! Why is this happening?

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.590
How disappointing!

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.030
What can we do without the car?

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.200
I've got an idea! Hey, Takumi.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.870
How about running in Kenji's 180?

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.230
Great idea!

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.870
It's the same FR...

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.070
...and it's got turbo for extra power...

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.710
It sure will run fast if you drive it.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.310
--It won't work.
--Why not?

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.050
I'm not gonna race in somebody else's car.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.120
It's gotta be my own car that I'm used to.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.490
You have a point.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.990
Driving somebody else's car

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.260
is not a good thing in the racing world.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.500
Anyway, I'll wait until the last minute.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.930
That's my only option.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.330
He's late. What's going on?

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.380
It's already 9:45.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.400
I guess he's not coming.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.920
Where is he?

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.550
--What time is it?
--Almost 10:00.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.090
Oh, no! He's not gonna make it!

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.420
<i>Where are you, Dad?</i>

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.860
<i>Please come back!</i>

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.230
<i>I don't have any more time!</i>

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.280
--He's back!
--What?

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.240
Turning off of the highway...

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.740
...gunning the engine twice,
that rhythm... and that roar...

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.350
He's here.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.000
You can tell that just from the exhaust sound?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.400
Are you sure it's your car?

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.400
Of course I am. It's absolutely my car!

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.780
The Takahashi Brothers are here.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.950
Yeah...

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.380
They must be very anxious about this race.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.050
They told me to my face that I'd lose.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.560
Damn Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.360
He's not as good as his reputation suggests.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.230
I'll beat the Eight-Six right in front of him

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.430
and embarrass him.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.140
Let's do it.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.910
And if you show that you're
faster than the Eight-Six

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.580
that beat Keisuke Takahashi...

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.850
...we can prove that we're
faster than the Red Suns.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:11.820
This is a good opportunity to
make the crowd realize something.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.690
The drift run can never beat the grip run.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:21.000
There you go! It's like your favorite phrase.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.530
It's a matter of course.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.730
The drift run is just a
performance to rile up the crowd.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.540
It's not a technique for driving fast.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.210
It's just like you to say it firmly.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.510
I can say this, 'cause I went
through a drift stage myself

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.550
when I was driving the S13.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.950
A racer who has outgrown the
drift run can drive the fastest

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.420
in the grip run.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.850
When you lost to the R32,

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.860
it was really shocking.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.030
Oops! That was a no-no.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.230
Well... I've changed since then.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.360
Since that monster defeated me,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.300
I'm driving better than ever before in the R32.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.910
You can't call yourself a street
racer if you stop pursuing races.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:10.210
I can't stand everyone making such
a fuss about the drift technique.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.880
Come out, Eight-Six!

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.050
Showing off by drifting in your FR is over.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.550
I'll prove it!

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.220
As usual, he doesn't show up
until the last minute.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.190
I wonder if he'll really show up.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.000
Didn't he tell you he had
no intention of coming?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.100
He's coming.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.340
I'm sure of it.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.700
He'll definitely come.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.280
Anyway, that's the story.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.620
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.680
You'd better hurry, Takumi!

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.950
It's almost time.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.720
We're sorry... We're taking Takumi with us.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.690
We'll buy ten of your deep-fried
tofu in return when we get back.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.020
Th-The ones mixed with veggies, too...

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.060
Hey! Wait!

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:11.970
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.340
<i>His eyes looked different.</i>

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.640
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.350
<i>Never mind.</i>

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.980
<i>With that setting, he'll do a good job.</i>

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.990
We're almost at the pass.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.890
I wonder if you can catch up.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.000
Sorry to disappoint you,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.170
but his car is a non-turbo 1.6.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.830
This is a 2-liter turbo.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.170
Whatever the case may be going downhill,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.440
it's no joke if I fall far behind him going uphill.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.740
Who do you think I am?! One of
the top three in the Speed Stars.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.160
Wow!

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.120
So fast!

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.220
I can do that, too.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.470
To full power!

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.540
--Oh...!
--Oh...!

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.700
He's gone!

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.470
The Eight-Six has disappeared!

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.420
<i>Takumi... You were looking away</i>
<i>even during the entrance ceremony.</i>

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:45.400
Two minutes to 10:00.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.160
<i>I guess they couldn't talk him into it.</i>

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.550
<i>I should go apologize like a real man.</i>

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.890
<i>Wait! Iketani told me to wait.</i>

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.860
<i>I should do as I was told.</i>

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.630
<i>But this is all my fault.</i>

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.340
<i>Nothing to do with the Speed Stars.</i>

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.670
<i>I should take my punishment like a man.</i>

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.580
<i>Oh, no! There are so many of them!</i>

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.580
<i>Looks like I have to roll with the punches.</i>

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.990
<i>This is no joke!</i>

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.230
<i>I doubt they'll be willing to forgive me</i>

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.390
<i>if I tell them the Eight-Six isn't coming now.</i>

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.380
<i>Apologizing on my knees won't help.</i>

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.150
<i>If worse comes to worst, I might get killed.</i>

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.120
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.520
<i>Help me!</i>

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.550
<i>Please, God!</i>

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.960
<i>I haven't even done it with a girl yet.</i>

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.960
<i>I don't wanna die a virgin.</i>

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.560
--It's him!
--He's here!

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.330
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.130
It's too late to run.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.360
<i>I'm dead!</i>

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.090
What the hell are you doing

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.820
sitting in the middle of the road, Itsuki?

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.590
Ta... Ta... Ta...

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.060
Get out of my way!

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:57.360
Come on! I'm gonna run you over.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.030
Takumi!

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.270
You came!

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.640
Yeah...

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.770
Sorry, Itsuki... for being late.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.780
Takumi...!

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.610
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right?

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.550
Takumi...!

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.310
Don't... Your snot... Hey, stop, Itsuki!

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.960
Yeah... That's the spirit!

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.130
Hello, this is Fujiwara Tofu.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.300
Oh, Yuichi!

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.340
Are you there?

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.210
I wonder what happened to my son.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.340
He wanted to go to the pass of his own accord.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.080
Like father, like son, huh?

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.380
Putting that aside,
today his opponent is a GT-R.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.090
Honestly, does he have a chance?

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.390
He really did show up.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.660
Keisuke, you were right.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.930
So it seems...

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.000
You were gonna tell that Eight-Six's driver

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.170
about the R32's weak point, weren't you?

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.040
I was, but not anymore.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.540
Once I saw his face, I felt nothing but disgust.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.200
He's my enemy, after all. Besides...

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.010
...he won't lose, even if he doesn't
know the R32's weak point.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.120
Did you give him any advice?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.360
Nothing special, but even
the GT-R has a weak point.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.360
The R32's weak point is...

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.260
Put simply... the body weight...

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.800
...the understeer resulting
from being super front-heavy.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.640
Even with a tuned pedal
and driving technique,

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.710
this basic fact doesn't change.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.710
If you keep driving tough on the downhill,

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.710
the front tires and brakes
will wear out for sure.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.750
Even with a tuned brake,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.050
by the time they come
to the bottom of the hill,

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.920
it'll have trouble with the
understeer going into the turn.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.590
If there is any chance of winning,

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.990
it's in the corners towards
the end of the course.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.430
Whether or not the Eight-Six can
keep up with the R32 until then...

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.840
That's the key to this race.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.040
About the Eight-Six's foot settings...

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.910
I changed the settings a little bit.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.930
The foot settings? How?

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.350
So that it will heavily understeer
when you step on the gas pedal.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.520
That's how the foot setting is now.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.590
What?! Understeer by
punching the accelerator?!

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.690
Takumi's driving uses drift.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.690
What were you thinking, Bunta?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.130
How can he race with that
foot setting against the GT-R?

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.600
You don't understand, Yuichi.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.970
If you are good enough,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.470
the understeer setting allows you
to accelerate faster when it's FR.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.400
For the purpose of carrying tofu,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.410
it's usually set lower.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.640
With this setting,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.640
it's possible to drive longer at full power.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.190
But only if you're good enough...

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.720
I'm sure he can handle it.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.530
<i>Sou tanin wa kaizai shinai</i>

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.060
<i>Never stop, tomaritakunai</i>

<i>Gisei ni natta ai ga cry shite mo</i>

<i>Peak mezashite, sweep the winding street</i>

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.140
<i>Beep beep! Keikokuon wa so cheap!</i>

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.600
<i>Sheep-tachi wa michi wo akero</i>

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.040
<i>'Cuz I'm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.910
<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

<i>Nigetemitatte doko demo safety zone</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.990
<i>Nani ka wo te ni irete nani ka wo wasureteku</i>

<i>Rage your dream, yami o harisaite iku</i>

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.380
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

<i>Sekaijuu no kogekitta yoru o keshiteku</i>

<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

<i>Konma zero-ichibyou de knockdown</i>

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.260
<i>Yoin nokoshikietekou to the next town</i>

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.100
<i>Hokori mau haishachi ni hau</i>

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.060
<i>Rikutsu dake no nougakitachi</i>

<i>Jamakusai kara shikato shitekou</i>

<i>Streaker satte yuku street no mukou</i>

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:03.370
<i>Something they would know</i>

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.410
<i>Rage your dream, tsuzuku hatenai michi wo</i>

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.410
<i>Ai mo kako mo furimukazu</i>

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:15.480
<i>Yukeru anata kagayaiteiru</i>

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.550
<i>Rage your dream, ima o ikiteiru</i>

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.560
<i>Mr. Nakazato, what is your chance</i>
<i>of winning against the Eight-Six?</i>

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.400
<i>Can't you tell without asking?</i>

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.730
<i>You mean your R32's going to win.</i>
<i>But Ryosuke Takahashi said...</i>

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.170
<i>He's just a coward since his brother lost!</i>

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.340
<i>I will teach them that I, Takeshi</i>
<i>Nakazato, am the fastest in Gunma.</i>

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:46.550
<i>I'll show them once and for all that</i>
<i>grip driving is better than drifting!</i>

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.620
<i>--What does...</i>
<i>--It means action, action!</i>

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.090
<i>Next time on Initial D, "Battle to the Limit!"</i>

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.020
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
