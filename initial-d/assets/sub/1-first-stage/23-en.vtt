Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.500
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Who knows?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.840
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.340
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.610
I'll take it easy,

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.110
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.890
I'll count down!

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.890
Five... Four...

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.060

"Act 23: The Rainy Downhill"

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.380
The S14 got off to a faster start.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.410
It's not a turbo, but it has a two-liter engine.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.050
It's not just the size of the engine.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.050
He used the clutch well on the wet surface.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.190
No wonder he's confident.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.260
That wasn't the Eight-Six's best start.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.490
He knows he can catch up once he gets going.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.330
<i>He took the lead!</i>

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.440
<i>Oh, no! His powerful S14 will widen the gap,</i>

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.730
<i>and we'll be left behind!</i>

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.620
He's way behind.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.050
This hill is too much for an Eight-Six.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.260
But it's downhill from here to the finish line.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.360

his killer downhill technique,

Hello?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.250
Hey, big brother.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.490
The Eight-Six and Kenta in the rain?

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.330
Yeah.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.900
Kenta is very confident
racing against the Eight-Six,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.830
but I know it won't be that easy.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.470
I agree. Drifting through corners at low speed

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.340
is completely different from an actual race.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.250
Yeah. It gets very difficult when
you have to floor the gas pedal.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.750
What tire grip can
compensate for on a dry surface

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.920
is severely limited in the rain.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.430
You have to shift the weight properly,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.930
or you'll lose control and crash in no time.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.800
I wonder if those two really understand

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.540
the difficulty of a rainy race?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.370
Interesting...

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.210
"Those two..."

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.980
You liar!

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.640
You're only interested in the Eight-Six.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.680
Help! I'm not ready to die!

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.090
Darn... it's coming down harder now.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.420
The opponent is from Akagi,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.660
so neither one has the advantage here.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.590
The problem is the rain.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.660
I wonder if he can perform in the rain?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.570
I'm sure he can,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.240
because he makes deliveries every day.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.350
I'm sure he's driven on rainy days.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.750
Of course he has!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.920
Then his technique

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.510
should be effective in the rain, too.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.730
<i>I won't let you catch up!</i>

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.400
<i>I'll widen the gap.</i>

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.770
<i>In the rain, I can even</i>
<i>outrace turbo-charged cars.</i>

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.700
He swung his tail!

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.260
The S14 is running well in the rain.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.330
It's hard to control an FR in the rain.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.230
Yeah. It only spins to the side, not forward.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.970
It's the Eight-Six!

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.520
Unbelievable!

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.990
What a drift in the rain!

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.470
What was that?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.630
That drift was scary.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.160
I have goose bumps.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.710
<i>Is this the same person</i>
<i>who was lost in a daydream?</i>

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.190
<i>He said he would take it easy...</i>

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.990
<i>So is this how he normally drives?!</i>

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.330
<i>Besides, it's impossible to see in this rain.</i>

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.190
<i>How does he do it?</i>

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.060
<i>It's so dark that I can't even see the road!</i>

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.240
<i>Stop that ringing!</i>

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.680
<i>This speed is insane!</i>

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.230
<i>He's not human.</i>

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.060
<i>He's a monster!</i>

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.850
<i>I'm on!</i>

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.530
<i>I'm in top form tonight!</i>

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.060
<i>I'll put an end to the</i>
<i>Eight-Six's undefeated streak!</i>

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.730
<i>It's not Keisuke or Ryosuke,</i>

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.220
<i>but me who will defeat him!</i>

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.230
<i>What?!</i>

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.950
<i>The Eight-Six is on my tail.</i>

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.450
<i>How? It can't be!</i>

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.720
<i>What's happening?</i>

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.160
<i>We haven't gone through</i>
<i>that many downhill corners yet.</i>

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.830
<i>This isn't happening!</i>

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.170
<i>I got caught so easily...</i>

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.290
<i>...going downhill in the rain.</i>

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.770
But...

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.970
...it's not over yet!

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.670
They're only inches apart!

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.390
Look! The Eight-Six is cutting in!

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.550
The Eight-Six is passing him!

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.040
He made it look easy.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.880
Are you kidding?

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.550
It was worth waiting in the rain.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.110
Yeah.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.190
<i>I can't keep up!</i>

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.620
<i>The gap widens with each corner!</i>

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.030
<i>I can't go around the corners as fast.</i>

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.370
<i>What could be making the difference?</i>

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.560
<i>I thought the rain was on my side!</i>

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.820
Right, I see.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.830
Word from the mid-point.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.170
The Eight-Six passed your guy.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.340
I guess he was way out of Kenta's league.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.410
He did well, though.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.780
The Eight-Six is even fast in the rain.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.080
It was obvious even before the race.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.110
The weather plays no part
in defeating the Eight-Six.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.160
It's finally your brother's turn.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.460
Welcome.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.800
Anyway...

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.700
...we now know that he can
race just as well in the rain.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.200
He's becoming more like
a true racer every day.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.010
He willingly took the S14's
challenge last night.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.180
His daydreaming seems to have passed.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.810
I think our operation was a big success.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.480
Yeah.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.890
Anyhow, Itsuki, you were lucky

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.530
to be able to experience
that rainy downhill battle.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:56.530
It was so scary that I
thought I would die for sure!

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.490
Besides, he told me to sit in the back instead.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.400
In the back?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.670
--Why?
--No idea.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.410
I don't even think Takumi
knew the reason for it.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.020
I get it.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.020
I think I understand the reason.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.350
Really?

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.560
What is it?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.250
It's because...

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.700
--Well...
--Well?

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.600
Itsuki's annoying.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:38.240
It must be hard to focus when
Itsuki's screaming next to you.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.740
That makes sense.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.230

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.790
<i>because he thought he</i>
<i>could get extra tire traction.</i>

<i>I bet he knew that intuitively.</i>

Thank you very much.

...I hear people are talking about your son.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.600
I hear he's good.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.480
What? This Saturday?

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.310
Against Ryosuke Takahashi? Who is that?

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.980
You don't know him?

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:44.550
Even my people know who he is.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.060
I hear he's the best street racer in Gunma.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.030
My son and he are racing, huh?

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.030
Who do you think will win?

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.560
Who knows? We'll find out this Saturday.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.500
You haven't changed a bit.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.640
I'm curious about the drift
your son learned from you.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.550
You scarred me for life
with your monstrous drift.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.050
That was years ago.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:24.020
--Mr. Tsuchiya, we need you.
--Yeah.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.020
Later, Bunta.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.710
I can tell that you've improved a lot, Itsuki.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.810
You really think so?

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.480
That means a lot coming from you, Takumi!

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.250
I've been practicing the "grip run," you know?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.430
Just for you, here's a
brilliant technique of mine

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:37.760
that resulted from hours of practice.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.560
"Illusionary Hell and Tear!"

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.740
This is strange!

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.510
I had no problem with it yesterday.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.950
The next corner, then!

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.850
"Incredible Braking!"

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.950
Hold on, Itsuki!

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.370
I can relax now.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.670
I was worried you were
daydreaming about girls again.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.310
Girls? What do you mean by that?!

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.310
I wasn't doing that!

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.880
But you were acting so weird.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.220
I told you that I was thinking...

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.050
...about what would
happen after this big race,

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.390
regardless of the outcome.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.230
Don't you get what I'm saying?

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.630
No idea.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.460
It's all a riddle to me.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.030
Why do you need anything after the race?

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.540
You don't need anything.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.510
You're already fast as it is.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.170
I'm not fast.

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.680
Yes, you are!

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.680
You have an undefeated streak going.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.350
I don't know.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:08.060
I just don't know where I'm headed.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.560
Can't you just focus on the big race for now?

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.390
You don't have much time left.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.030
Ryosuke Takahashi...

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.530
<i>It's the moment of truth for your</i>
<i>"fastest racer" theory, Ryosuke.</i>

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.570
<i>I'm looking forward to the opportunity.</i>

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.340
<i>So, what exactly is your theory?</i>

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.470
<i>2</i>
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with E = mc.</i>

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.980
<i>It's Einstein's Theory of Relativity.</i>

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.910
<i>I've added my own sub-theories to it.</i>

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.420
<i>"E" symbolizes the opponent's</i>
<i>average speed and...</i>

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.390
<i>Next on Initial D: "Akagi's White Comet!"</i>

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.080
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
