I'm pretty sure it says "Trueno" on the back.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.860

high grip to reduce my times.

I'm also replacing the brake pads.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.730
On the downhill, braking is crucial.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.370
Will you run, Iketani?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.570
Yes. I'll run the downhill.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.910

<i>No, that's impossible. He was totally</i>

<i>...Ghost of Akina.</i>

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.760
<i>I don't give a damn about the Speed Stars.</i>

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.200

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.510
Wow! The one and only Drift King,
Keiichi Tsuchiya! I can't believe it!

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.440
It looks like he can control it

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:11.980
Takumi...

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:16.620
Don't you wish we could go out
right now and drift just like this?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.220
--Sure.
--Check out this drift! Awesome!

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.560
Sure.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.530
Takumi...

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.960

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.870
Hey! You keep saying, "Sure. Sure."
Do you even know what drift is?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.530
Sure, I know what drift is.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.570
Well, then, can you tell us what it is?

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.240
In a curve...

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.680
Don't say "curve." It's not cool.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.050
Street racers say "corner."

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.720
Okay, in a corner...

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.150
...you make the front tires slide

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.550
so that the car won't face the inside.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.420
What?!

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.560
That's a good one, Takumi!

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.600
If the front tires are sliding,
that's called "understeer,"

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.430
which is totally uncool
and for people with no skill.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.740
A true drift isn't in the front--

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.600
it's in the rear.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.510
You're really funny.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.340
--That was great, Takumi!
--It definitely was!

<i>the car is basically understeering.</i>

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.720

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.280
High octane, fill it up.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.810
Yes, sir.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.360
You're a real enthusiast.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.700
I see. I thought I had seen
that S13 somewhere before...

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.570
The Speed Stars.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.350
Can I ask you one thing?

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.050
You'd be the one who'd know...

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.580
Is there a ghost on Mt. Akina?

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.110
The ghost of a super fast Eight-Six.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.530
Wow. Is he planning to fly with this?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.930
Please don't joke around with me, sir.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.440
The part about the ghost was a joke,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.800
but it's a black-and-white panda Trueno.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.770
On the outside, it's a normal Eight-Six...

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.540
...but inside, it's an incredible monster.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.240
There's no way a local like
you doesn't know about it.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.550
Well, fine then.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.920
If that's your secret weapon
for this Saturday's meet,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.020
then I just got my wish.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.820
Tell the driver of that Eight-Six

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.890
that I won't lose to the same guy twice.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.360
The reason I lost last time

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.530
is because I didn't know
the course and I got careless.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.730
Thanks for coming.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.570
<i>Keisuke Takahashi lost?</i>

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.910
<i>What did he mean?</i>

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.110
<i>I don't know anything about such an Eight-Six.</i>

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.880
<i>Could it be...?</i>

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.590
<i>The Eight-Six I saw at Takumi's house</i>

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.590
<i>was a panda Trueno.</i>

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.620
<i>Was the boss telling the truth?</i>

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.460
<i>The fastest on the downhill</i>
<i>is still that Eight-Six?</i>

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.230 line:50 %
"Green Shopping Street"

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.830
All right, that's it for today.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.610
Isn't this a lot more than usual?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.080
It's fine. Just don't spill any.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.110
I know.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.740
Your face is sleepy as usual, Takumi.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.510
Sorry, but I was born with this face.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.740
Don't forget the Eight-Six on Saturday.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.380
I know. You're so persistent, Itsuki.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.580
If I don't make sure about it,
you might back out on me.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.350
Please, Saturday, come quickly!

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.360
I'm totally excited!

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.690
Hey, if both of us aim to become street racers,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.130
maybe someday we'll be
known as the fastest on Akina.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.170
I don't really care either way.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.300
Well, even if you tried,
it'd be hopeless for you.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.310
After seeing you scream in
the back seat of Iketani's car,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.910
it's obvious you don't have an ounce of talent.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.640
But I'm different!

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.750
I was a little bit scared,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.220
but I was able to look at the
corner exit with my teeth clenched.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.480
Even Iketani has faith in me!

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.250
He must think Takumi is hopeless,
but I have a bright future!

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.430
Huh? Takumi?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.930
Takumi!

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.660
Takumi! Takumi, wait a second!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.500
What's wrong with you? I know
you're jealous of my talent,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.270
but aren't you being a bit cold?

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.500
I'm not...

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.040
And then Rumiko told my boyfriend
all about it. He got really mad!

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.280
I saw.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.380
You like that kind of stuff?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.680
Of course not!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.850
It must be a crime to let them
make their skirts that short.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.510
The school should make a new rule...

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.160
Lucky!

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.660
Good morning, Takumi!

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.030
Mogi?!

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.740
That's right. I have to talk
to you about something.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.640
Come along, quickly!

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.200
What is this?! What the hell is going on here?!

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.980
What's wrong?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.220
Well... I...

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.560
There's something I want to tell you.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.550
What is it?

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.160
Well...

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.060
I...

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.330
I bought a new bathing suit!

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.570
It's totally cute.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.770
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.340
Bingo.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.510
I was so happy that I just had
to tell somebody about it!

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.210
Wanna see it? Are you
wondering what color it is?

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.980
You want to see it soon, right?

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.480
Well, I want to, but...

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.390
I'll let you see as much as you like

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.220
when we go to the ocean, okay?

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.990
Until then, just... you... wait... and... see.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.890
How about this Sunday? Are you free?

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:16.630
Yes. I have a break from work.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.900
Okay, it's decided. It's a promise.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.370
A promise should never be broken.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.470
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.960
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.060
<i>Damn. It's too tough.</i>

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:53.330
<i>The corners that I never thought of as corners</i>

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.000
<i>are becoming more and more dreadful.</i>

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.170
<i>These corners that I am so familiar with</i>

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.940
<i>have now begun to show their fangs!</i>

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.570
<i>It's no use. Even if I push myself to the limit,</i>

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.870
<i>I can't cut my times down.</i>

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.310
<i>I thought that if I gave it more throttle,</i>
<i>I could cut my times down.</i>

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.370
<i>But it's not that simple.</i>

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.180
<i>Is this the limit of my technique?</i>

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.380
<i>There's no way I can compete with them.</i>

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.060
Hello! Excuse me!

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.920
Hello?!

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.500
Excuse me!

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.570
I can hear you. Give me a minute.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.190
Sure.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.540
Welcome.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.370
<i>Is this the Eight-Six driver</i>
<i>and the fastest on Akina?</i>

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:10.170
<i>Is this the guy who defeated</i>
<i>Keisuke Takahashi's FD?</i>

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.380
What do you want?

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.940
Sir?

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.990
Fried tofu, please.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.520
Coming right up.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.390
<i>What am I doing?!</i>

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.220
Um... I...

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.990
My name is Iketani,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.520
and I'm with a street racing team
called the Akina Speed Stars.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.870
The truth is, I heard this strange rumor

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.210
that the fastest downhill driver on Mt. Akina

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.980
is an Eight-Six driven by
the owner of a tofu shop.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.380
I don't know who told you that, but it's not me.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.250
Please don't play dumb!

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:52.990
I searched the whole city, and this is
the only tofu shop with an Eight-Six!

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.180
Here you go. 140 yen.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.360
Thank you.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.000
Well... I'm kind of in a tough situation.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.030
Can you please listen to what I have to say?

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.040
What a bother. Right in
the middle of my work...

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.440
But you're not doing anything!
I'm the only customer here!

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.210
That was rude, saying something like that...

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.680
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.380
The truth is, a team called the Akagi Red Suns

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.390
challenged us to a time attack battle.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.120
The Red Suns have some drivers
with awesome technique.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.430
Nobody on our team can compete with them.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.030
But since this is our mountain,
we definitely don't want to lose!

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.800
So what do you want me to do?

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.870
Mr. Fujiwara... Please teach me
how to tackle Mt. Akina.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.880
That's an impossible request.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.480
Please! Even just enough to make
me a tenth of a second faster!

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.120
I beg you!

00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.750
I know how you feel,

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.320
but driving technique cannot be
improved in two or three days.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.730
In order to make your car do what you want,

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.030
you have to think continuously
and practice on your own.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.170
When I was actively racing,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:15.240
I was tackling Akina even in my dreams.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.770
Technique isn't something that can be taught.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.170
It's something you find on your own.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.350
Sorry... I can't help you.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.120
Mr. Fujiwara, I'll be back again.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.370
<i>"Think continuously and</i>
<i>practice on your own..."</i>

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.580
<i>I've done that, but my times</i>
<i>haven't improved a bit.</i>

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.140
<i>Why not?!</i>

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.010
<i>Dammit! No matter how hard I try,</i>
<i>I just can't understand it!</i>

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.850
<i>I can't avoid it! Please! Get to the inside!</i>

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
