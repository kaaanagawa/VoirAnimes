00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.590
--Yeah!
--Go!

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.640
He couldn't have!

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.550
We already knew how great he was.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.240
But since this is my last race...

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.260
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.090
What are you, scared?!

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.260
You're useless!

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.360
You're nothing but dead weight.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.170
--Dead weight?!
--You're ballast,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.100
messing up the power-to-weight ratio!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100
<i>She gets tough behind the wheel!</i>

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.440
I'm not ballast!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.780
I'm not fat! I have a nice body!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.110
Forty-nine kilograms of extra weight!

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.410
I weigh 47!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.210
Fine, I've got my pride, too!

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.960
Ready, Mako?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.060
We'll put our lives on the line!

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.030
Welcome back!

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.700
All right. Enter the next turn so
you almost scrape the inside wall!

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.600
Got it!

Natsuki?

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.140
When will I see you again?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.410
I'm not sure. School starts soon...

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.280
<i>Natsuki...</i>

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.170
The next turn looks sandy.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.010
--Hug the inside!
--Got it!

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.690
No cars ahead! Drift through it!

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.810
<i>I couldn't be my usual self</i>

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.010
<i>because I was too conscious of him.</i>

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.550
<i>Deep down, I believed that no racer</i>

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.010
<i>could follow us, no matter how great he was.</i>

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.750
<i>But now I see.</i>

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.660
<i>I can't race well if my attention</i>
<i>is on what's behind me.</i>

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.930
<i>I'll never look back again.</i>

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.690
Drift here!

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.280
There can't be many turns left.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.550
Yeah.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.220
I wonder if he's still chasing her?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.250
To be honest, I thought the
race would end a lot sooner.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.590
No way!

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.260
Even if he can't pass her this time,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.430
he'll win the next race.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.100
He can't pass her.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.760
I'm amazed he's still in the race.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.260
He just had to be the cat on this new course.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.580
Wow, it started!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.120
My name is Mako Sato.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.760
Call me!

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.160
Sorry about that...

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.600
To make this summer memorable,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.500
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.900
That's my wish.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.740
In return for my wish...

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.300
...I'll give you my virginity.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.160
Iketani!

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
What?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.160
You were spacing out.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.960
It's so obvious that you
were thinking about Mako.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.030
It's not like that!

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.870
No need to hide it.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.500
I have to admit that she's a cool girl.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.140
Kenji...

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.310
I don't know the details,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.520
but after this race,
you should give it another try.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.850
You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.510
I don't care.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.140
Drift here!

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.070
There's a car ahead,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.900
but it's still three turns away,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.670
so enter this turn at full speed!

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.070
Okay, Sayuki.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.920
Get ready for the car.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.070
It sounds like a race.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.100
Really? I wanna see!

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.370
Their downhill technique will
show you how good they are.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.750
Amazing...

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.730
I called it!

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.600
<i>Sayuki can time oncoming traffic perfectly.</i>

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.840
<i>She can spot the distant headlights</i>
<i>flashing through the leaves.</i>

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.810
"Grip" and stay inside!

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.650
<i>Good job, Mako. You're right on.</i>

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.650
Drift right through here!

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.350
No cars ahead! Drift again!

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.870
<i>Amazing. Maybe too amazing...</i>

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:44.670
<i>Good racers always leave room for error.</i>

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.910
<i>It may look like they're exceeding their limits,</i>

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.750
<i>but they only use full</i>
<i>"wheel grip"when exiting a turn.</i>

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:57.420
<i>They ease up on the "wheel grip"</i>
<i>when braking into a turn,</i>

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.080
<i>because one mistake on an</i>
<i>unforgiving course means a crash.</i>

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.160
<i>But...</i>

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.000
<i>...she has no margin for error right now.</i>

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.490
<i>She is too focused to even realize it.</i>

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.210
<i>Should I mention it to her...</i>

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.910
<i>...or not?</i>

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.750
<i>It's my job to let her know.</i>

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.370
<i>However...</i>

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:51.540
<i>...I don't want to say anything</i>
<i>to mess up her perfect run.</i>

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.110
<i>I've decided.</i>

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.610
<i>We're the best team.</i>

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.810
<i>How can I not believe in her?</i>

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.580
<i>This is her best race ever.</i>

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.800
<i>Man, what a charge!</i>

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.010
<i>She picked up the pace again.</i>

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.980
<i>Any faster, and I'll exceed my limit.</i>

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.280
<i>Even now, I'm barely in control,</i>
<i>abusing all four tires...</i>

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.950
<i>Darn, I may not make it...</i>

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.950
This is our last chance to shake him off.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.050
I know.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:20.890
No cars ahead! Go for it!

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.980
<i>He's not following...</i>

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.710
<i>Why not?</i>

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.710
Mako, you're going in too sharp!

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.670
We can't recover! Spin away from him!

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.070
<i>Oh, man!</i>

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.130
<i>Please don't hit us!</i>

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.350
--We're saved.
--Brilliant.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.000
We lost.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.700
He's so skilled...

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.720
...that I almost hate him.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.800
How do you feel?

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.240
We lost...

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.540
...but I feel very satisfied.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:32.640
It reminded me of the excitement
I felt when I first started racing.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.500
We would practice until sunrise.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.990
That same pure sensation...

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.910
You went too far at the end,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.580
but you were great until then.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.280
The best race ever.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.120
Sayuki...

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.260
Whatever you decide to do from now on,

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.850
just know that you have my blessing.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:14.930
Thanks, Sayuki.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.600
No need for tears, Mako.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.800
Let's just enjoy this glorious moment.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.450
They're back!

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.490
I wonder how the race went?

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.500
You think they're going again?

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.120
Probably...

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.270
Takumi!

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:08.750
Takumi...

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.950
I find it hard to believe, but...

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.850
I guess we won't need the second race, huh?

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.590
No second race. It's all over.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.430
I knew it.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.670
Even for Takumi...

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:32.540
No... I didn't want to see him lose like this.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.810
We lost.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.980
Come again?

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.220
What did you just say?

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.290
I said we lost.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.320
Don't make me repeat it.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.290
He's the winner.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.520
What?!

00:18:55.130 --> 00:19:02.700
--Yay!
--Wow!

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.850
I never imagined we could
lose on our own turf.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:18.890
All I did was follow you,
and I barely did that,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.390
so I don't think I really won the race.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.760
Don't be so modest.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.220
With your skills, you have
the right to rub it in.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.930
But...

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.670
We've put in hours of practice here,

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.370
so we were very confident.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.410
You chose to chase us,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.010
and we couldn't shake you off.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.410
We accept our defeat, right, Mako?

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.950
Yeah.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.780
<i>Mako...</i>

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.960
That was by far the best race ever.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.690
Thanks.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.240
You're blushing big time.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.980
You're a mystery.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:20.550
Your racing ability is extraordinary,

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.920
but otherwise you barely seem ordinary.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.120
This is how he usually is.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.920
When he's not racing,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.490
we can't tell if he's awake or asleep.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.660
Hey, thanks a lot.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.460
Itsuki's right, though.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.660
Anyhow, I'm amazed how
young and good you really are.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.010
<i>You should give it another try.</i>

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.340
<i>You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.</i>

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.150
Iketani.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.660
Thank you for tonight...

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:08.100
Mako, I...

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.460
Don't be depressed, Iketani!

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.700
Racers don't need girls, right?

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.670
Right...

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:32.690
<i>Actually, he has a really adorable face.</i>

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.490
Hey, what's your name, anyway?

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.500
--Takumi Fujiwara...
--Itsuki Takeuchi, 18!

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.630
I'm an Aries and type O,
and my favorite car is...

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.330
I don't think I asked you...

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.510
Anyway, since we're friends now,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.380
how about going swimming
together sometime?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.580
That sounds great!

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.580
Kenji?

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.490
--Sure.
--How about you, Takumi?

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.660
--Yeah...
--You, too, Iketani?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:15.150
Yay! Thank you, Sayuki!

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:22.690
Let's go wild and crazy with my Eight-Five!

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.030
<i>If men weren't honest with themselves,</i>

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.870
<i>mankind would've been extinct long ago.</i>

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.700
<i>You're right, boss!</i>

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.140
<i>The beginning of a relationship is important.</i>

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.400
<i>Make sure that you don't...</i>

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.250
<i>Hi, Honey. I'm on my way...</i>

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.250
<i>Leaving, boss? Make sure you don't what?</i>

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.990
<i>Next on Initial D: "The End of Summer."</i>

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:55.580
<i>Make sure you don't miss it!</i>
