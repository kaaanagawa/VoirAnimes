<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.920
<i>And just love you</i>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.550
I'm glad we came, Kenji!

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.480
Itsuki, this is paradise!

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.890
It's amazing!

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.620
Takumi!

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.690
Come over here and swim with us.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.030
Um, I'm okay...

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.700
Okay, we're coming!

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.640
What's wrong? Come on!

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670

You're coming wth us, right?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.860
What's wrong? Aren't you having fun?

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.260
Yeah, sure.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.430
Let's go down the slide, Takumi.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
I think I'll just hang around here instead.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.100
He's always hanging around.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.440
Can we come?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.440
Sure. You guys can come along, too.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.610
We can come along!

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.440
Okay, let's go!

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.950
Shall we go, Takumi?

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.420
I'm not too good with slides...

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.940
It's nothing compared to your super drift.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.260
She's always like that...

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.290
Forceful and single-minded.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.300
I see no harm in it.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.430
They're having fun.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.970
Was it really okay for all
of you to take today off?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.060
I used a sick day. My boss wasn't too happy.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.980
<i>She's so beautiful...</i>

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.050
<i>...that my heart may explode.</i>

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.460
<i>Seeing her in her swimsuit</i>

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.090
<i>is my best summer memory ever.</i>

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.820
<i>I'll never forget it.</i>

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.440
<i>After all, she is out of my reach.</i>

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.740
Iketani.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.180
Thank you very much for everything.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.780
--Well...
--I'm very grateful.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.770
I realized many things the other night.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.320
Mako...

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.790
I'm sorry to have bothered you,

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.490
but I've decided to keep racing.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.490
That's good!

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.000
I was hoping you wouldn't quit.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.530
I was conceited,

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.330
because they labeled me "Usui's fastest."

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.270
We can't recover!

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.040
Spin away from him!

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.660
That race forced me to realize
the depth of driving technique.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.300
And if I quit now,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.570
I'll be leaving things unfinished.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.800
I'm glad to hear that.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.670
It's good to know what I did was useful.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.010
Iketani?

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.040
You remember our promise
by the lake, don't you?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.020
It came out wrong,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.690
so you may have misunderstood me, but...

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.060
...I didn't mean it like a deal.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.400
Would you...

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.430
...make me a woman?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.840
I'll be waiting for you around 8:00,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.250
under that billboard where we first met.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.630
Can we slow down?

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.590
So cute!

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.860
<i>Her breasts are against my back...</i>

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.110
I have Kenji against my back...

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.880
This is so sad!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.480
No!

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.730
Mako, can you get the ball?

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.720
Please!

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.820
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi!</i>

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.150
Ready, Sayuki?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.490
Here!

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.490
Bad throw!

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.360
Sorry!

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.820
Bad throw.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.770
<i>Why does she carry his picture?</i>

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.280
Anything wrong?

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.010
Oh, no...

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.490
Can I ask you a question?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.990
Sure.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.200
You said you've never
had a relationship before.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.230
Yes...

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.670
But you must have had a
crush on someone, right?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.570
Sure.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.210
I just wondered why you
didn't go out with him.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.180
I'm sure most guys would die
for a pretty girl like you.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.650
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.820
What does he do?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.520
He's a street racer, too.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.860
It was about three years ago,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.390
when I was still in high school...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.880
A few of us from school went to see a race.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.040
I knew nothing about street racing then,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.850
but this one car left a
lasting impression on me.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:47.920
Even I could see that he had
a very special talent for racing.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.760
I was mesmerized by the world of racing,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.960
and got hooked on it.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.410
I got my license and managed to buy a car.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.650
I practiced day in and day out.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:22.460
I thought I'd feel close to him if I got better.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.220
Perhaps it wasn't the right motive.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.900
I often went to watch him race.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.750
But I never even talked to him...

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.850
...so I'm not sure if I really
liked him in that way.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.760
I can't say whether I was
admiring him, or his technique.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.990
But you liked him.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.630
I guess so.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.960
I guess I liked him a lot.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.970
<i>What a fraud!</i>

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.810
<i>I shouldn't have asked.</i>

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.800
<i>She seems far away now.</i>

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.990
<i>She was admiring a superstar...</i>

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.320
<i>The number-one racer in Gunma...</i>

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.850
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.630
<i>Now I know why she likes FCs.</i>

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.160
<i>How can I possibly compete with him?!</i>

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:22.740
<i>He's finally ready to go</i>
<i>head-to-head with the Eight-Six.</i>

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.880
Do you want to come along?

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.790
I'll show you my "fastest racer" theory.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:36.450
Big brother...

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.900
That was so much fun!

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.370
I never knew that going to the pool
with girls was this much fun!

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.610
Right, Takumi?

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.100
You were mostly with Kenji, though.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.420
Mako and Sayuki are the best, right, Kenji?

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.120
You do recover quickly.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.220
Just a few days ago,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.990
you were saying that racers didn't need girls.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.580
Those two are different.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.730
Itsuki!

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.800
All I can see is those two in their bikinis.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.640
So blinding!

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.610
Sayuki's bouncing breasts are something,

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.140
but Mako's body is just incredible.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.840
Right, Iketani?

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.520
I guess so.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.450
You don't sound very convinced.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.450
What's wrong?

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.260
Did you two have a fight or something?

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.590
No.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.320
I'm just tired is all.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.000
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.610
I'm sorry about today, boss.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.610
No big deal.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.450
You should enjoy your youth while it lasts.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.150
I'd be worried if you only cared about cars

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.020
and didn't have a girlfriend.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.690
--Yeah.
--Good luck.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.490
Your angel's name is Mako, right?

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.320
How's it going?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.000
It doesn't look too good.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.170
She is definitely too good for me.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.140
Don't be so negative.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.410
Listen, girls are like...

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.910
No, boss, it's okay. I have no chance.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.050
I can't compete with Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.710
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.820
<i>What's going on? I can barely follow him.</i>

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.700
<i>His FC is the same, so what's going on?</i>

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:24.550
<i>My theory evolves with each new piece of data.</i>

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.600
<i>Be patient, Eight-Six!</i>

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.430
<i>When my theory is complete,</i>

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.270
<i>you'll be on my "defeated"list.</i>

"Kamameshi"

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.600
<i>I got here first.</i>

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.000
<i>My heart is pumping so fast that I can't breathe.</i>

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.910
<i>I may die when Iketani gets here.</i>

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.980
What?

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:22.120
You just don't understand
women at all, do you?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.980
Listen to me.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.690
It's not that she was actually dating him, is it?

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.630
Every young girl has a crush on somebody.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.160
It's no different than admiring idols on TV.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.530
Yeah.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.830
Just think about it for a minute.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:43.640
She decided to come clean with you

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.970
because she chose you over him.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.310
She revealed her secret to you
because she trusts you.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.610
Can't you see that?

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.780
Forget about your stupid inferiority complex!

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:01.460
Being in love means that you
accept everything about the person.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.980
Isn't that what love is all about?!

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.480
Eight o'clock?!

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.990
It's half past, you idiot!

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.190
I won't make it.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.430
It'll take at least an hour to get to Yokokawa.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.760
She won't wait for me.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.430
Just go!

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.830
You won't know that until you get there!

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.860
Go, or you're fired!

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.120
If you call yourself a racer,
don't let up on the gas.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.060
Drive as if your life depended on it.

00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:17.530
But he probably won't make it.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.370
That's also part of being young.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.210
<i>The boss is right.</i>

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.480
<i>I'm such an idiot!</i>

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:47.390
<i>I'll never meet anyone like her again.</i>

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.890
<i>Why couldn't I be more honest?!</i>

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.770
My name is Mako Sato.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.100
Call me!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.110
I'll give you my virginity.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.840
I'll be waiting for you around 8:00,

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.780
under that billboard where we first met.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.840
<i>She was always honest with me... but I...</i>

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.240
<i>I'm certifiable!</i>

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.620
My feet hurt.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.860
I hate high heels.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:11.850
<i>Mako, I don't need to go to a hotel with you.</i>

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.680
<i>Well, I want to, but...</i>

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.850
<i>What am I saying?</i>

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.680
<i>I just want to see your face.</i>

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.490
<i>Please, God...</i>

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.530
<i>I just need one more chance!</i>

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.050
<i>Please don't take away my angel!</i>

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:37.570
<i>Traffic? An accident? Not now!</i>

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.750
<i>No!</i>

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.340
<i>Oh, God, why?!</i>

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.780
<i>I'm sorry, Mako.</i>

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.780
I'll never wear high heels again.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.400
<i>Ah! Takumi, what's with that bouquet?!</i>

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.230
<i>--Uh...</i>
<i>--Oh! It's from Natsuki, isn't it?</i>

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.370
<i>--No...</i>
<i>--I get it. It was a present to you,</i>

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.840
<i>the driver of the Fujiwara Tofu Shop</i>
<i>(Private Vehicle)</i>

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.070
<i>black-and-white Trueno that every</i>
<i>racer in Gunma knows about now,</i>

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.210
<i>from a gaggle of girls!</i>

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.910
<i>--Uh, that's not right.</i>
<i>--Ah! So it's from Sayuki.</i>

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.480
<i>Sayuki was after you in a weird way, huh?</i>

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.750
<i>No. I got this from Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.920
<i>Huh?</i>

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.220
<i>Next on Initial D: "Challenge From a Superstar."</i>

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.920
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
