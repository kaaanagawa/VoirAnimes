<i>That's our law!</i>

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530
<i>Don't feel bad.</i>

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.930
<i>The Eight-Six of Mount Akina</i>
<i>will simply turn into metal junk.</i>

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.750
<i>I'm pissed off! He did that on purpose.</i>

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.010

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.800
Wow, watch out!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.110
Didn't he just hit the guardrail on purpose?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.120
And he used the rebound to reverse-drift!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.990
What's that Eight-Six thinking?!

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.820
<i>Are you serious?</i>
<i>The Eight-Six is closing the gap!</i>

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.660
<i>That's impossible!</i>

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.500
Does he have a death wish?

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.800
That Eight-Six driver has lost his cool.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.480
<i>When an average racer</i>
<i>loses his cool, that's the end.</i>

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.810
<i>He keeps making mistakes, so he can't go fast.</i>

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.050
<i>But this guy is different.</i>

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:54.290
<i>His innate driving sense takes over</i>
<i>and controls the Eight-Six.</i>

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.490
<i>The hotter he gets, the faster he goes.</i>

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.990
<i>This race is over, Shingo.</i>

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.540
<i>Darn...</i>

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.480
<i>My EG6 has been running near its limit.</i>

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.710
<i>What the heck is going on?!</i>

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.160
<i>I'm scared.</i>

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.100
<i>I've never felt this scared</i>
<i>in a downhill race before.</i>

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.890
<i>He's on my tail!</i>

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.620
<i>I can't believe my EG6, the best of its class,</i>

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.960
<i>is being overtaken by an Eight-Six!</i>

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.790
<i>It's not about the speed anymore,</i>

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.960
<i>but something fundamentally different.</i>

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.200
<i>That Eight-Six is unreal.</i>

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.870
<i>But all I have to do is make</i>
<i>sure he doesn't pass me.</i>

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.210
<i>After these hairpin turns, the finish is near.</i>

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.300
<i>I'll win this race!</i>

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.150
<i>Don't think I'll give you the inside!</i>

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.590
<i>No! Is he gonna bump me back?</i>

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.220
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.940
<i>I thought he was gonna bump me, but...</i>

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.310
<i>...that cornering!</i>

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.310
<i>He slipped right through on the inside.</i>

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.780
Yeah, Eight-Six!

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.150
<i>He passed me...</i>

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.820
That's incomprehensible!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.630
I hope Takumi is okay.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.270
Maybe we don't need to
worry about him anymore.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.810
What?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.440
He's come this far,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.110
which means that he has
adapted to the situation.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.350
Who knows? He may be
way ahead of that EG6.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.680
If that's the case,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.390
that Night Kids punk must
be sweating like a pig.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.790
Yeah. Right about now,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.620
he may be regretting
having challenged Takumi.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.410
<i>This death match was my idea...</i>

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.050
<i>If I lose, I'll be the laughingstock of the team.</i>

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.180
<i>I'll make sure to protect my pride,</i>
<i>even if it means a tie.</i>

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.520
<i>This is a short, straight line,</i>

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.190
<i>but the B-16A engine can</i>
<i>get me side by side with him.</i>

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.060
<i>He can't escape.</i>

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.000
<i>How about ending this race...</i>

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.430
<i>...with a double crash?!</i>

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.280
Here they come! Who is ahead?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.940
The EG6, of course.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.490
The Eight-Six?!

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.900
What's wrong with him?!

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.630
Was he gonna kill me or what?!

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.510
The EG6 isn't coming.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.910
What happened to Shingo?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.560
<i>My EG6...</i>

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.310
--Is that Takumi?!
--No!

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.180
Did you crash?

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.550
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.820
Are you okay? Injured?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.430
Get in.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.090
I'll give you a ride to the hospital.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.000
It's faster than calling an ambulance.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.570
I can't let you do that much.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.270
Just make a phone call for me.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.380
Don't act so tough. You're hurt.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.880
When we crash, we help each other out.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.290
We're locals, so we know
an emergency hospital.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.720
Thanks. I owe you one.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.030
He's unbelievable.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.260
Who is he, anyway?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.490
Takumi? Takumi!

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.260
Are you awake? Come down for a second.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.590
What?

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.300
I'm awake. I'm on time.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.730
Just come down a minute.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.970
How do you explain this mess?

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.640
You bumped the car, didn't you?

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.980
I see three scratches
made by hitting guardrails.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.350
I don't remember...

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.920
Maybe it was you.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.320
I didn't drive at all yesterday!

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.860
Only you drove it!

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.190
Look at these scratches on
the bumper and the fender!

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.700
You're right! Who did this, really?!

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.200
It's you!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.360
Ouch! What was that for?

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.210
--Oh...
--What?

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.010
I may remember bumping it a little.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.680
What's wrong with you?

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.980
You're still too young to forget things.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.190
I raced against this jerk yesterday

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.660
and lost my cool during the race,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.990
and came home all
flustered and just fell asleep.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.060
I don't know how it happened,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.000
but as long as you bump the car,
you're still a beginner.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.530
I wouldn't have bumped it once.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.240
And did you win?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.040
Yeah...

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.510
I see.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.280
Are you allowed to do that, Itsuki?

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.620
Yeah. The test results showed no problems.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.780
I'll be out soon.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.130
I brought you flowers.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.030
I'll put them in here.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.960
Thank you.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.600
So, I heard, Takumi!

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.640
You won the duct tape death match!

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.370
Yeah.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.480
Takumi, you're the best,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.110
defeating him with that FR-killer rule!

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.120
You're nothing short of a genius!

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.720
Itsuki...

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.920
...I really wanted to win
that race, no matter what.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.390
He pissed me off, but that's not why.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.790
I just didn't want to lose the race.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.000
I had never felt that way before during a race.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.470
You're becoming more like a real street racer.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.640
A street racer? No, it's not like that.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.940
I'll refine my skills when I get out of here

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.110
so that I won't embarrass you
and our Akina "Levin Trueno" team.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.580
What were you talking about?

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.150
Um, nothing...

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.120
By the way, how is Saori?

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.020
I'm worried about her.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.820
She's fine. She says hi.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.660
Cool!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.960
When I get out of here, all four
of us can go for a drive again!

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.990
--Sure.
--Yeah.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.440
I'm glad that Itsuki is okay.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.780
Yeah. His Eight-Five should be back soon, too.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.480
I lied about something.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.280
Saori was shaken up so
badly after the accident

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.190
that she doesn't want to
think about it ever again.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.560
Hmm...

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.900
So she knows that he's a nice person,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.800
but it wouldn't work out between them.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.900 line:50 %
"Practice Guide"

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.130
Saori isn't coming to see me...

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.710
Darn it!

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.980
A street racer doesn't need a girlfriend!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.230
What brought you here tonight?

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.000
I was on my way to an ATM

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.500
and thought I would stop
by to see your ugly face.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.210
Takumi banged it up pretty good, didn't he?

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.440
Of course, with that race, he couldn't help it.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.050
That idiot... but he's heading
in the right direction.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.280
You have a smile on your face
after he messed up your fender?

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.120
His style is changing.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.590
He was good before, but there
was something missing.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:14.960
Lately, he's going faster.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960
He stepped it up a notch.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.970
How can you tell, Bunta?

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.540
When you see this Eight-Six
day in and day out,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.640
you can tell how he's driving.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.540
I guess that makes sense.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.080
I'll stop by on my way back.
Let's have a drink tonight.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.640
Yeah.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.330
Takumi is crazy...

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.600
...but his dad's just as crazy.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.790
He hasn't changed a bit.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:22.290 line:50 %
"Mountain Kamameshi Bowl"

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.300
<i>I just can't help it...</i>

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.880
<i>Not that I expect anything,</i>
<i>but I can't just pass by...</i>

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.700
Um, I'm not a crazy person or anything...

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.740
I was just wondering
what's wrong with your car.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.510
I have no idea what's going on in there.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.180
No matter how much I turn the
ignition, the engine won't start.

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.480
I can take a look at it, if you don't mind.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.490
I'd appreciate it.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.320
It sounds like something electrical...

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.150
Let's see...

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.760
<i>S13...</i>

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.870
<i>Speed Stars.</i>

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.210
Ouch.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.900
--What do you think?
--Well...

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.620
<i>My face has never been this close</i>

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.720
<i>to a woman other than my mother.</i>

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:57.720
<i>My heart can't take this...</i>

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.130
<i>She is so cute!</i>

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.400
<i>What a nice smell!</i>

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.580
<i>I'm smelling a cute girl</i>
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.040
<i>Oh, no! I hope I don't smell like sweat!</i>

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.660
Okay, it should start now.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.820
Go ahead and try the ignition.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.100
Good!

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.270
Wow, it started! Amazing!

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.270
Thank you very much for your help.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.330
You saved me.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.150
No, it was nothing.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.780
That's not true.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.020
I respect guys who are good
with mechanical stuff.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.620
I'd like to thank you later, so...

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.690
...can I have your number?

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.260
Don't worry about it, really.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.100
Okay...

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.100
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.440
<i>This could be the only chance I'll ever get!</i>

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.950
<i>I'm such an idiot! An idiot! I'm an idiot!</i>

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.650
Excuse me?

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.210
Yeah?

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.280
Here.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.850
My name is Mako Sato. Call me!

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.220
<i>I stood there for thirty minutes</i>

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.060
<i>wondering what had just happened.</i>

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.050
This isn't a dream!

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:19.100
<i>I happened to run into an angel</i>

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.660
<i>under the Kamameshi billboard.</i>

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.500
<i>You appeared before me</i>
<i>suddenly in the bright light.</i>

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.000
<i>And I instantly became a puppet</i>
<i>by your blinding beauty!</i>

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.570
<i>What's wrong, Iketani?</i>

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.010
<i>I can no longer live without you!</i>

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.810
<i>You have become my queen,</i>
<i>my angel, who controls my mind!</i>

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.580
<i>He's deep in his own world...</i>

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.320
<i>Next on Initial D: "The Angel of Usui."</i>

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.850
<i>The angel?! Oh, my Mako!</i>

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.850
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
