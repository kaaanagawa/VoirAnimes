No way!

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.270
A girl you just met gave
you her phone number?!

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.740
Am I supposed to believe that?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.210
What's the catch, really?

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.210
Really, Iketani!

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.740
The world isn't that simple!

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.740
I, uh, I...

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.720
Racers don't need girls!

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.790
Besides, if there's no catch, it's not like you.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.660
What do you mean by that, Kenji?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.660
Are you putting me down?

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.970
No, but it sounds too good to be true.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.640
I hate seeing you jealous of my happiness.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.080
Her long brown hair waving in the wind

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.120
and her seductive eyes glancing at me.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.120
I'm positive God sent me this beautiful angel

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.490
because I'm an honest, hardworking man!

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.930
I'm off to Karuizawa tomorrow to see Mako.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.870
Well, back to work!

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.370
Hey, why don't we follow
him and check her out?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.710
Good idea!

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.940
I wanna see her with my own eyes.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.280
But what if Iketani finds out?

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.880
Don't worry!

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.450
He's lost in a fantasy world right now.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.860
Let's go see what she really looks like,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.190
this angelic Mako.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.860
Hey, leave Iketani alone.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.700
We won't bother him.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.870
When she dumps him, we'll cry with him.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.630
That's friendship!

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.230
When she dumps him?

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.530
I doubt she's as pretty as he says she is.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.830
He exaggerates everything.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.000
--He gets obsessed, too.
--Right.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.170
I think we were in junior high

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.510
when we went fishing at Akina Lake.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.210
The fish weren't biting,

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.850
but I managed to catch a
small one right before we left.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.180
He was, like, "Wow, it's huge!"

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.190
He went crazy.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.290
It was this big.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.620
People came to take a look at it.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.800
I was so embarrassed.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.730
He exaggerates. That's how he is.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.430
Kenji, look to your left.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.370
Crap!

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.380
I was lost in the story and
didn't realize I'd sped up.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.380
So much for tailing him.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.880
Sorry, Iketani!

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.380
Forgive us!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.290
We just wanted to see what she looked like.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.790
Seriously!

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.720
We had no intention of bothering you two.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.160
Don't be mad, okay?

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.460
We'll turn around at the next interchange.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.770
Oh, man. You don't have to go home.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.170
I don't mind introducing you to her.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.170
--You sure?
--All right!

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.840
But...

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.980
...don't follow us after that,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.810
or I'll be really mad!

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.610
Cool!

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.280
Anyway...

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.150
...these are my friends.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.350
Hi, I'm Mako Sato.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.300
--Hi...
--Hello.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.960
--Shall we, Mako?
--Yeah.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.940
Shoo, shoo!

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.940
We're not dogs.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.820
This isn't a dream.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.690
Unbelievable.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.360
It's shocking to see Iketani
with such a pretty girl...

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.700
Racers don't need girls.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.340
Let's cry together, Kenji.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.370
What?

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.170
Are you saying that I can't find a girlfriend?!

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.970
It's just a joke!

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.910
What should we do now?

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.820
Well, during this season,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.160
Karuizawa isn't the place
for three guys to hang out.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.590
Shall we go to Usui Pass?

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.050
Sorry...

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.780
So, what kind of cars do you like?

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.520
I liked, uh...

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:49.420
I admired the last generation RX-7.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.130
An FC!

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.620
Hey, you have good taste.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.970
You're a racer, aren't you?

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.800
Oh, um, is it that obvious?

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.970
Normally, I try to drive like everyone else.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:15.620
So, Mako, what do you think of street racers?

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.090
They're okay. I like cars myself.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.620
You do?!

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.420
Street racers usually have

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.260
better skills than normal drivers.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.300
You can buy expensive cars with money,

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.270
but you can't buy technique.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.970
I have much more respect for
those with good driving technique

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:41.980
than for those with fancy imports.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.110
<i>She's a good girl... an ideal girl!</i>

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.290
So, this is Usui Pass.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.630
I've never been here,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.030
but it's much curvier than I had imagined.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.130
It looks tough.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.370
One corner after another,
and the road is narrow.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.270
It doesn't look anything like Akina Pass.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.540
I wonder who the fastest is here at Usui Pass?

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.650
Um, Iketani?

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.220
Yes?

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.720
How would you feel about a girl
who liked to drive the passes

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.220
and acted like a street racer?

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.730
--A Sileighty?!
--Yes.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.500
They say a blue Sileighty is the fastest now.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.370
And surprisingly, its driver is a woman.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.370
A woman?!

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.310
--A female racer...
--Yes...

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.820
I'm totally okay with it, really.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.990
As a matter of fact, I'd feel more
comfortable if she were a racer.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.250
--Really?
--Yeah.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.260
<i>Now I get it.</i>

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.900
<i>She wants to be a racer,</i>

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.330
<i>which is why she likes an FC.</i>

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.840
A Sileighty with a woman driver.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.010
A Sileighty...?

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.610
--Is that an import?
--No.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.250
It's a 180 with a Silvia front end on it.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.510
Silvia and 180, so "Sileighty."

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.220
Its driver is the fastest at Usui Pass,

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.220
and is a woman.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.230
I gotta see that!

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.860
You can see her there at night, usually.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.370
It's not wise to challenge her, though.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.460
No locals even come close to her.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.920
It's called Akina Speed Stars.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.490
I built the team.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.630
We have a young racer who they say

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.600
is the fastest at Akina Pass.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.470
Speed-wise, I'd say I'm right behind him.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.640
What's wrong, Mako?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.970
No, it's nothing.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.640
Sorry, I must be boring you with my car talk.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.950
No, it's not that.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.580
I love cars, too, so it's fun.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.580
Really? I'm glad.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:45.260
So, do you also admire great
drifting skills and all that?

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.430
Sure.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.860
You need a lot of experience, like I have,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.530
to use that technique, though.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.440
It's dangerous.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.040
So, you're good at drifting?

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.670
--Sure.
--I'm happy for you!

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.870
Yeah?

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.350
Thank you for a wonderful day.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.830
--So, Mako...
--Yes?

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.530
Well, I'm wondering if you have...

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.170
...you know, someone...

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.730
...you're seeing right now.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.700
I don't have a boyfriend.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.510
So, call me again, Iketani.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.380
<i>Wow!</i>

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.890
Can you hear me, Iketani?

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.920
Wake up, Iketani.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.530
Um, I'm...

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.230
Why are you here?!

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.340
We couldn't go back, 'cause
we were worried about you.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.430
So, how did it go?

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.610
Today was a fine day, indeed.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.620
You hungry? Dinner's on me!

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.690
We can also check out

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.560
the racers at Usui Pass.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.590
It sounds like it went well.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.690
I guess miracles do happen.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.970
--Wow!
--They're good.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.060
Every driver here has good skills.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.310
Hey, Takumi?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.880
You've never been to other passes, right?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.210
How was it?

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.880
Well, I mean, I wasn't the one driving,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.720
so I really can't say.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.660
Are you sure? Your eyes were pretty serious.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.460
Yeah?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.790
They look totally different now,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.960
as if you're a different person.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.800
Could you race here?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.300
I wouldn't know until I tried it.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.930
--There!
--The Sileighty?!

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.480
--Continuous reverse drift!
--What the...?!

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.650
<i>She's good!</i>

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.490
--Did you see that?
--The narrow road made it intense!

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:35.700
<i>I told Mako that I was good at drifting,</i>

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.970
<i>but I still panic when the rear slides out.</i>

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.340
<i>I seriously have to work at it,</i>

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.470
<i>or I'll lose my angel!</i>

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.540
--Let's head down.
--Yeah, okay.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.040
Every pass has a great racer.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.330
He's going pretty fast, isn't he?

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.330
We got three people here.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.800
I can't keep up.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.230
We'd better give him some room.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.140
He seems out of sync,

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.540
and his car's acting weird.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.710
How can you tell?

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.010
I'm not positive, but that's
probably what's going on.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.740
Probably?

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.360
He spun out!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.550
Takumi was right.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.260
Crap! A car's coming!

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.710
That was close!

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.340
Who is this idiot?!

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.780
As the rear slides out, he panics
and spins out of control.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.920
It's a beginner's mistake.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.080
Hey, S13!

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.190
Move out of the way, or you'll
put other drivers in danger!

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.090
I'm moving...

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.460
That's so embarrassing!

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.450
Let's act like we don't know him.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.760
Sorry about that...

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.080
What's wrong?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.050
Nothing.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.230
<i>So, it's Mako whose Sileighty</i>
<i>is the fastest at Usui Pass.</i>

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.960
<i>I wanna die!</i>

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.680
--A day off?
--He hasn't called, either.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.090
This is very rare for a workaholic like Iketani.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.350
He must've taken it real hard.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:18.190
He didn't say a word after
what happened last night.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.260
At a rest area on the way back,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.700
his eyes were dull from shock.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.470
I felt too bad to say anything to him.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.140
I had a bad feeling about this.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.340
She was too cute to be his girlfriend.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.380
Like I said, racers don't need girls.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.510
Itsuki the Lonely Driver... that's my title.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.970
I hope he'll snap out of it soon.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.860
Telephone, Koichiro!

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.500
Tell them I'm sleeping...

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.500
It's probably Kenji.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.530
It's a girl named Mako Sato!

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.820
Did you want to talk to me?

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.250
Yeah...

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.020
If you're here to make fun of me, please don't.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.360
No, I'm not here to make fun of you.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.350
I never suspected it was you.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:36.500
I saw your Sileighty drift
through the narrow road.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.940
The fastest at Usui Pass...

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.450
You could've warned me about that.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.110
I'm sorry.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.620
I've never told anyone about this.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.850
It was shocking to me, too,

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.020
and I realized that I owed you the truth.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.120
The truth?

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.700
I'm really the quiet type.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.130
It's hard to believe that a quiet type

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.900
could drift that dynamically.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:16.040
I'm one of those people whose
character changes behind the wheel.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.250
No matter how fast I drive,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.880
men don't see me as girlfriend material,

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.050
so I've decided to put an end to this.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.580
I'm quitting racing after this summer.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.130
To make this summer memorable,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.930
I would like to race
Akina's Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.570
Wha...?

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.570
That's my wish.

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.970
In return for my wish...

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.570
...I'll give you my virginity.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:54.750
Wait a minute! That's nonsense!

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.520
--Am I not good enough?
--That's not it.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.820
He's my friend,

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.120
so I can't sell him out like that.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.530
<i>I get it now.</i>

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.660
<i>Her true intention...</i>

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.830
<i>...was not me, but Takumi.</i>

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.670
<i>Otherwise, a pretty girl like her</i>

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:18.500
<i>wouldn't be interested in someone like me.</i>

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.540
I understand.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.550
I'll do what I can.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:30.050
--Really?
--Don't get me wrong, though.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.660
I'm not doing this
because of your proposition.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.160
Iketani...

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.960
I just want to make your wish come true.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.210
<i>It's okay...</i>

00:21:54.210 --> 00:22:00.250
<i>...because for a short while,</i>
<i>I was falling for her.</i>

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.150
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.260
<i>I'd probably be laughed at for this,</i>

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.700
<i>but I really liked her.</i>

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.070
<i>I loved her...</i>

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.330
<i>...even though I was mistaken.</i>

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>Yokubou dake ni kararete miushinatteita</i>

<i>Mujaki na hitomi ni miserarete yuku</i>

<i>Tatta hitotsu kono omoi o shinjitsu da to ieru</i>

<i>Yorokobi o kanadeyou...</i>

<i>Kiseki no hana yo</i>

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.360
<i>Mako, how can you be interested in Iketani?</i>

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.000
<i>I don't know...</i>

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.470
<i>And you made that big proposition.</i>

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.070
<i>Maybe that was a little too much...</i>

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.310
<i>There're tons of good-looking guys,</i>

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.740
<i>so why Iketani?!</i>

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.080
<i>But I kind of like him...</i>

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.980
<i>--I really don't get it!</i>
<i>--Shush!</i>

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.520
<i>Next on Initial D: "Sudden-Death Death Match."</i>

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.850
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
