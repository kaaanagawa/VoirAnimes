Is it okay to drop you off
at this kind of a place?

It's all right, because my house is right there.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.480
You said this car was pretty sad-looking,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.580
but I like this car.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.980
It runs smoothly,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.820
and it's small and cute...

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.250
What kind of car is this?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.650
It's a Trueno.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.090
Trueno...

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.250
Let me ride in this Trueno again.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.900
I had fun today, Takumi!

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.370
Bye-bye. I'll call you later.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.340
She called you cute...

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.330
What are you going to do?

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.700
I can keep up with Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.690
As I thought, this GT-R is the best.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.300
Even though the driver is good,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.140
with the out-dated FC,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.540
this is its limit, isn't it...?

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.760
I'm Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.520
I'm a member of the Red Suns.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.830
I know.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.560
I'm Takeshi Nakazato.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.730
I belong to a team at Mt. Myogi
called the Night Kids.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.400
Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids...?

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
Are you the fastest street racer
on Mt. Myogi's downhill?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.370
I'm honored to be recognized by
the superstar, Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.510
But I've heard Nakazato of the Night Kids

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.070
is driving an S13, if I remember correctly...

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.720
It doesn't matter...

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.720
So what is a street racer
from Myogi doing at Akina?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.460
Hang on a minute. Let's not talk about me.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.030
You belong to Akagi, don't you?

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.630
Didn't we come here for the same reason?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.640
I wanted to meet the Eight-Six I saw yesterday.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.840
The one using the R32
tries to bite the Eight-Six?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.210
With the R32, which is
tuned for 380 horsepower...

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.550
What?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.180
I can see it easily

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.980
by looking at the exhaust

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.820
and its power on the straightaways.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.550
But the result is obvious.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.820
On the uphill, the Eight-Six
is no match for the R32.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.090
On the downhill, there is no way

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.230
your R32 can beat the Eight-Six.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.830
What did you say?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.230
Are you saying my R32 will lose
to the Eight-Six on the downhill?!

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.610
Don't take it personally.
I'm just saying what I think.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.780
You don't have much nerve.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.180
Even though your brother lost,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.680
there's no need to be so intimidated.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.850
It's just an Eight-Six.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.620
Once you race against it, you'll see.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.920
I'm the only one who can beat him.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.360
Don't joke with me.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.990
You've already said it, and now
I can't walk away no matter what.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.230
I'll beat the Eight-Six and
make you eat your words.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.960
You can be arrogant for now.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.470
Don't forget that I am Nakazato from Myogi!

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.740
I'm telling you now

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.570
that the rotary is not a match for this R32!

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.420
<i>...driving an S13, if I remember correctly...</i>

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.360
<i>That's right... since that time, I have changed.</i>

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.740
<i>Damn! I can't pass it!</i>

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.850
<i>Even if I get close in the corner,</i>

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.380
<i>he pulls away in the straightaway...</i>

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.620
<i>I have better technique as a racer!</i>

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.550
<i>Crap! How could I lose?!</i>

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.980
<i>With this S13, I can't beat an R32,</i>

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.320
<i>no matter what I do...</i>

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.920
<i>I, who was called the fastest</i>
<i>street racer on Mt. Myogi's downhill,</i>

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.050
<i>lost to an R32, which can't even do a drift...!</i>

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.530
<i>All cars have their limits.</i>

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.690
<i>No matter how excellent</i>
<i>the driver's technique is,</i>

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.600
<i>you can't drive beyond the car's limit.</i>

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.090
<i>Even that Eight-Six...!</i>

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.340
Good morning!

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.540
Hey!

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.310
Here, Iketani!

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.010
What's that?

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.520
Fried tofu.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.280
It's left over from yesterday.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.290
My father told me to bring it to you.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.450
Oh, really?

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.620
I'll put it in the refrigerator.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.790
Wow... I'm surprised he thought of me...

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.860
--By the way, Takumi...
--Yeah...?

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.700
Is it true that you've been delivering tofu

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.800
to Lake Akina for the last five years?

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.540
Yeah...

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.310
I thought we were friends.
Why didn't you tell me?

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.910
Because if I talked about it,
we could have gotten into trouble...

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.980
Well... I guess so...

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.820
Five years ago,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:45.880
we were just starting junior high...

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.530
You've driven much longer than I have.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.590
Since junior high,
you've been driving every day,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.530
even in the snow and rain, on Mt. Akina.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.770
It's early in the morning.
So I don't see anyone...

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.270
No, not that! Those corners!
Weren't you scared?

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.840
Well... in the beginning, I was scared.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.450
But the fear was completely
gone within six months.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.820
When I accelerate, the tires slip naturally.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.290
So it took another half year

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.290
until I could slip and control them as I wanted.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.690
That means...

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.330
...you mastered the downhill in a year.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.690
If you do it every day,

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.860
your nervousness about
slipping disappears quickly.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.630
I had nothing to do,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.040
so I started to see how close
I could get to the guardrails...

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.800
Would a normal person do
something that dangerous?!

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.540
I never thought it was dangerous.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.880
When I'm at my best, I can
get as close as about 1 cm.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.550
One... one centimeter?!

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.380
Unless I find fun stuff to do like that,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.880
it's pretty boring

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.250
helping with my father's business.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.990
That's why I've never thought I
wanted to improve as a driver...

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.730
But I would get impatient,

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.390
and would want to get home faster.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.000
So when I don't have tofu on the way back,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.900
I go as fast as I can.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.270
--Takumi... can I ask you a question?
--Yes...

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.340
How do you drive when
you have tofu in the car?

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.710
If you go too fast, you'll
damage the tofu, won't you?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.910
I can't go very fast on the uphill...

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.220
My father puts water in a paper cup

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.750
and puts it in the cup holder.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.590
If I can drive without spilling the water,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.450
he says I won't damage
the tofu, even if I'm going fast.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.530
In the beginning, I found it to be very difficult.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.530
Even when I drove slowly, it spilled all over...

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.130
I would think so...

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.700
Brake, steering wheel, shifting, gas pedal...

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.870
If even one of them is a
little rough, the water spills.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.610
My father often says to roll
the water in the paper cup.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.880
Roll the water in the cup?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.210
I suppose it's the surface tension...

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.780
The water's surface tension

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.890
makes it roll around the rim of the cup.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.990
At each corner,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.980
I roll the water to the edge
of the rim as I drive up the hill.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.730
It took me a long time

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.070
to be able to drift without spilling the water.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.100
Drift without spilling the water?!

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.900
Can you really do that?!

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.270
Don't lie! You're just joking, right?!

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:25.180
The primary point in controlling
a car is the center of balance.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.020
The Drift King, Keiichi Tsuchiya,
also says so in the video...

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.850
In order to drive without spilling
the water in the paper cup,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.790
you have to master the car's center of balance.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.190
Not to mention drifting...

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.600
It's impossible to do that!

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.030
I'm not lying!

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.570
Just because you beat Keisuke Takahashi...

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.640
You're carrying it way too far! I know better...

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.710
--Oh, a customer.
--Oops...

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.410
Welcome!

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.900
Fill it up with high octane? Yes, sir!

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.210
<i>Amazing, Bunta...</i>

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.720
<i>His technique is way above</i>
<i>just a regular mountain racer...</i>

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.080
Thank you very much!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.660
Takumi! I have a favor to ask.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.330
Can you let me ride next to you

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.090
when you do the downhill at Akina?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.410 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.340
You want to use the car?

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.110
At this time of the day?

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.880
Oh, well, I didn't think you'd let me.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.080
That's all right. It's not a big deal.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.780
I don't mind.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.390
Are you sure?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.360
Don't you need the car for anything?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.060
Like a meeting at the Chamber
of Commerce or something?

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:46.530
You'd better think a little bit.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.800
What are you talking about?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.530
You sound like you'll be in trouble
if I don't have to use the car.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.530
Well, no... I didn't mean that...

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.100
Then take the car.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.370
But in return, you need to
pick me up at my meeting.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.000
So you do have a meeting!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.420
My heart is really beating fast!

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.360
It's like just before getting on the
extreme ride at the amusement park.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.260
Oh, shoot! Lucky you! I'm envious!

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.660
I don't think it's that much fun.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.000
I'm going, Iketani.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.200
Yeah! I can count on you, Takumi! Go all out!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.430
Shoo, shoo! Get away, you guys!

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.350
It sounds great!

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.870
It's the best! A turbo can
never sound like that!

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.700
<i>The first corner is coming up.</i>

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.530
<i>I'll figure out what he does different from me,</i>

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.200
<i>and then steal his technique...</i>

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.510
Hey...! Hey!

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.030
Takumi! Brake!

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.680
<i>How... How can he control the car like this?</i>

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.550
<i>What's going on?!</i>

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.150
Incredible...

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.900
<i>The speedometer warning sound is on!</i>

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.030
<i>That means it is way over 100 km/hr.</i>

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.560
<i>We're coming up on the next corner!</i>

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.640
The Eight-Six is back already?

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.170
I wonder what happened.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.160
It's too early to return from the bottom.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.880
He passed out...

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.860
Takumi!

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.890
Which corner was it?

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.360
The third one...?

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:49.940 line:50 %
"Iketani Passes Out!"

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.330
Wow! I... I saw it!

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.070
The agonized cry of his last
moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.270
The scary downhill!

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.370
Iketani, in the third corner...

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.210
...passed out!

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.910
It must be true...

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.110
Wow! Mr. Tachibana! Why are you here?!

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.350
I was curious...

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.190
I suppose I'm not welcome...

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.460
Take your time...

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.330
I know that guy.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:16.800
Nakazato of the Night Kids
has no opponent in Myogi.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.310
I can't be impressed

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.010
by the technique of a person who drives a R32.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:22.980
It's just that the car is fast. That's all.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.180
I wonder if that's true...

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.810
You don't think so, brother?

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.680
Here we go again. Keisuke hates the R32.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.490
But, Ryosuke...

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.760
I don't think it's good if
Nakazato defeats him first.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.060
If the Night Kids beat

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.830
the Eight-Six that we couldn't beat...

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:46.030
...it may look like the Red Suns
are a notch lower than the Night Kids.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.500
That's the way rumors go...

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.410
I think that's Nakazato's plan.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.010
I don't think you need to worry about it.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.550
There is no one in the Night Kids
who can beat the Eight-Six.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.380
As long as it's the downhill of Akina,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.320
no one can beat him.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.020
Only my brother can handle it.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.060
The Eight-Six is fast and on a higher level.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.360
I don't get it...

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.800
Why can't the new state-of-the-art cars

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.970
with high power beat the Eight-Six?

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.800
Sometimes a car has too much
power to do the job. That's all.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.840
What?!

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.810
The turbo power is a strong
weapon on the straightaway,

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.910
but coming out of the corner,
it hinders the car's behavior.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.850
It's like a double-edged sword.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.250
From that aspect...

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.350
...once the Eight-Six is set,
it can go faster and faster.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.890
On the technical courses
where the straights are short,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.860
sometimes the car that
is aggressive can be faster,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.660
even though it doesn't have much power.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.160
Keisuke's turbo, which had increased power,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.930
had the opposite effect...

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.400
That's right...

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.540
On the downhill of Akina,
the total amount of time I could use...

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.740
...all of its 350 horses was very little.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.710
Right after the moment I thought
I had pulled far away from him,

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.680
I had to brake for the next corner,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.650
and the time it took before I could
accelerate was too long, and it irritated me.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:12.320
Well, that is what happens
with the FR that transmits power

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.990
to the road surface using only the rear tires.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.360
Hey, wait a minute!

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.530
Then what will happen
with the R32 that is a 4WD?

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.630
The ATTESA E-TS System
can give stable traction

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.330
even when giving it the gas,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.700
so he can use the turbo power

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.230
as much as he wants, can't he?

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:30.800
Nakazato's R32 may
be able to beat the Eight-Six...

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.810
Thank you very much!

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.710
Welcome!

But I feel strange...

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.400
The way I look at you has changed...

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.760
What's that?

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.430
Have another <i>onsen-manju</i> ["hot spring bun"].

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.960
Yeah...

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.940
When you're doing that,
it's the regular Takumi.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.480
A spacey guy who looks
sleepy and eats <i>manju.</i>

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.120
Calling me a spacey guy is pretty rude.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.520
But...

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.160
...once you're in the
driver's seat of the Eight-Six

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.630
and jump onto the mountain...

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.000
...you are the pride of
the street racers in Akina!

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.170
The hero everyone admires!

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.470
Really?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.670
Is that right?

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.840
It's embarrassing...

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.170
I told you I'm not talking about now!

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.980
Now you're just a spacey
guy who is eating <i>manju.</i>

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.210
To tell you the truth, I feel kind of strange...

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.680
About what?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.390
During the last race,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.520
and yesterday when I had Iketani ride with me,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:58.060
I was just driving as usual.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.900
I don't understand why
everyone is so excited about it.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:08.200
I've never done anything that
makes other people happy.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.210
<i>I'm starting to think...</i>

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.540
<i>...that driving is becoming fun...</i>

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.380
--Hey!
--What?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.930
A black R32?

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.700
That's the one we've seen a lot recently.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.800
Crap! He's on my bumper!

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.130
Don't let it pass us! Try hard!

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:44.240
Yeah... On the downhill,
the difference in power is smaller.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.110
We have the Eight-Six that beat the FD!

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.090
<i>Small fish!</i>

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.870
He passed on the outside!

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.090
What a thrill! A completely
different level of acceleration.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.390
As I thought...

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.130
...in reality, it is impossible
to race and beat a power car...

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.620
...with a gutless car.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.600
<i>This is an amazing machine.</i>

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.270
<i>Since I switched to this car,</i>

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:55.810
<i>my former rivals are no longer a match for me.</i>

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.410
<i>I lost the opponents who</i>
<i>made me run seriously.</i>

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.380

<i>which attacks with gripping tires</i>
<i>and makes me concentrate totally,</i>

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.030
<i>I have no use for it.</i>

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.430
<i>Come out!</i>

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.860

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.330
<i>At first glance, I felt it!</i>

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.330
<i>You are enough of an opponent for me.</i>

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.460
