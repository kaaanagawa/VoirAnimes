00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.670
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.460
<i>In the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.130
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.800
<i>My body is frozen in a</i>
<i>memory that I can't shake</i>

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.570
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.710
<i>Broken in the night</i>

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.910
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.050
<i>All from someone's whim</i>

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.290
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.920
<i>And just love you</i>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
Vroom!

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.000
And at the corner I went...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.830
Voosh!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.130
...as I cleared it.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.640
At that moment, I was like the wind.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.140
Nothing beats the pass.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.180
When you have your own cars, go check it out.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.510
My car? It's an Eight-Five,
every racer's dream car!

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.640
You probably didn't know that.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.150 line:50 %
"Act 21: Challenge from a Superstar"

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.570
This summer was very memorable.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.000
--Why?
--"Why?"

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Because I bought a car,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.040
and you debuted in the
racing world like a comet.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.240
Don't tease me like that.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.650
One, two, three, four...

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.980
What are you counting?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.220
Four is the number of
races you won this summer.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.710
First, Keisuke Takahashi of the Red Suns' FD.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.760
Second, Nakazato of the Night Kids' R32.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.210
Third, the duct tape death match
with Shingo Shoji's EG6.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.290
Finally, Mako and Sayuki's
Sileighty at Usui Pass.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.270
Four for four.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.380
Your undefeated legend began this summer.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.450
You're no longer just a dummy.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.050
Stop exaggerating.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.550
Don't be embarrassed!

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.990
Keep winning, Takumi!

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.460
Until I beat you,

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.130
and become the fastest in Gunma--
no, in all of Kanto!

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.170
They'll be calling me... "Itsuki, Akina's Comet"!

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.790
Huh?

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.010
Since school ends early today,

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.310
let's go do something in the afternoon.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.910
I kind of have to work in the afternoon.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.120
What? You do?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.590
I want to ride in your car again...

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.020
...because it's very cute.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.490
If you say so... but it's my dad's car.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.160
You said you wanted to buy a car.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.130
Are you saving up?

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.970
I save most of what I make,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.970
but I'm still far from it.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.310
How much do you need?

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.810
Around a million yen.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.480
A million...

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.480
How much do you have now?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.810
Not even close.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.650
Takumi?

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.790
What would you do if I gave you the money?

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.860
I wonder...

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.530
I bet you'd thank me,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.530
and treat me like a princess.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.700
You'd owe me big,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.040
so you'd have to quit working

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.510
and take care of me and love me every day!

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.010
--I'm so embarrassed!
--Quit kidding around.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.480
That's too much money
for us to come up with.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.490
I know that!

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.990
I was just wondering.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.330
You have no imagination.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.260
That's too far off to imagine.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.500
We now know that Takumi's
technique is the real deal

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.100
and will hold up anywhere.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.840
It's more than just technique.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.670
--Thank you very much.
--You need natural talent

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.340
to be able to race well on a new course.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.180
He's a genius because he
defeated all those modern cars

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.120
with his ten-year-old Eight-Six.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.790
--How gratifying!
--Get a load of you!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.460
You're the one who said he
couldn't compete anywhere else

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.630
because he only knew Akina.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.460
I know I did, but...

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.300
We all thought that.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.970
Takumi is abnormal.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.640
When I heard the news,
I was sure he'd lose at Usui

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.040
against Mako's Sileighty.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.140
Sorry, Iketani.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.310
Don't worry about it.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.980
I've decided to go by
"Iketani the Lonely Driver."

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.310
That name sounds familiar.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.220
Welcome.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.330
Flowers?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.060
Are you sure this isn't a mistake?

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.590
This is a gas station...

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.970
Takumi, this is for you.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.070
Who is it from?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.910
From Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.310
What?!

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.140
Ryosuke...

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.340
...Takahashi.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.580
From the number-one superstar in Gunma...

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.310
...to Takumi!

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.790
What does it say?

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.590
Let me see.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.860 line:50 %
"To Panda Trueno

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.860 line:50 %
9/15 10:00 PM, Mt. Akina Peak"

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.790
September 15th at 10 PM...

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.020
...at the top of Mount Akina.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.470
Is that all it says?

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.200
It sounds like...

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.040
It's finally here.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.970
A challenge from Ryosuke Takahashi

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.780
for a downhill battle.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.180
Wow!

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.010
What are you gonna do?

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.680
You know he has to accept the challenge.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.620
Takumi already smoked
Ryosuke's brother Keisuke.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.790
That's right. Avoiding a rematch

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.020
is more humiliating than losing one.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.810
What's the matter?

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.040
Don't you like being with me?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.650
--Of course I do!
--You seem uninterested and preoccupied.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.060
That's normal, I guess.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.020
You seem so far away.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.530
If this isn't fun, we should go.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.160
It is fun!

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.170
Sorry, I apologize.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.730
I'll forgive you if you tell me
what you were thinking about.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.430
Well, I don't think you would really get it.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.100
--Bye!
--Okay, I'll tell you!

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.850
A battle?

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.090
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.690
No. A battle is a car race.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.090
A car race?

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.800
I never knew that racing was your hobby.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.440
It's not really my hobby, but I
guess it's kind of become one.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.480
My next opponent is very
good and very well known.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.720
I've been thinking about it since this morning.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.990
I must be feeling the pressure.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.060
You're a good driver, so you'll be okay.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.430
It's not that easy.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.800
If you don't want to race, just ignore him.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.130
It's not that I don't want to.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.470
I may lose to him,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.900
but I don't want to not race him.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.630
That's so like you.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.840
You want to do it deep down, don't you?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.850
You don't show it,

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.650
but I know you're very competitive.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.750
I kind of like that about you.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.430
Ready to go?

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.480
Why don't we talk a little more before we go?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.040
Sure.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:50.340
I know why you got in a fight
with that senior in the locker room.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.380
After you quit the team,

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.690
your teammate told me why.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.420
You stood up for me, didn't you?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.730
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.900
Don't be.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.000
It doesn't matter now.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.810
That's Takumi's Eight-Six.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.670
Who is that girl?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.850
Man, Keiichi Tsuchiya's drift is incredible!

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.150
Look.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.190
Look at these pictures.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.210
Takumi? Hey, Takumi!

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:19.290
What is it, Itsuki? Lunchtime?

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.960
You idiot!

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:25.490
Sorry, I was just talking to myself.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.370
Takumi's been acting weird?

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.810
What's so weird?

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.480
He seems out of it.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.140
That's normal.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.850
I know, but he was better during the summer.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.020
But when school started,

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.990
he suddenly got even worse than before.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.330
Tired from all the races?

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.600
He just started racing this summer.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.700
He may have lost his focus because of school.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.540
I don't think that's it.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.510
It's like something in his head broke.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.950
Is he gonna be able to race like that?

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.790
He has a girlfriend, doesn't he?

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.590
What are you talking about?

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:24.730
I just thought he might
be daydreaming about her.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.960
Daydreaming?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.930
Just like how you were with Mako...

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.870
Kenji... that name is taboo here.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.470
It's all right, Itsuki.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.650
Anyway, I happened to see
Takumi driving with a girl.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.080
Are you serious?!

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.550
I just got a glimpse, but she was pretty.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.050
Takumi's girlfriend...

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:10.000
No wonder he's been
ditching me after school lately.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.970
That traitor!

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.480
I've never even held a girl's hand!

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.310
That's it! That must be the reason!

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.750
I'm positive!

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.580
Leave it to me!

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.450
I'll take him out and interrogate him!

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.660
Racers don't need girls, right, Iketani?!

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.490
Right!

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.460
We are the "Lonely Drivers"!

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.660
This is sad.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.690
What's on your mind?

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.690
You've been...

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.720
...dating Mogi behind my
back lately, haven't you?

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.500
Oh, is that all?

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.730
"Is that all"?!

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.000
It's no secret.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
But nothing special to tell, either.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.170
No excuses! Just answer this question...

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.980
How far did you go?

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.180
Honestly, how far did you guys go?

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.880
How far?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.350
Be honest with your best friend!

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.760
Itsuki, watch out!

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.200
I'll tell you!

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.830
Then tell me!

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.270
Last Sunday...

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.500
Sunday!

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.270
...the two of us...

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.870
The two of you...!

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.870
...went to Akina Lake.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:59.440
Hey, Itsuki, watch out!

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.950
What I mean is...

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.960
...which base did you get to, you idiot?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.360
Which base?

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.760
Did you kiss her?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.130
--Sure.
--What?!

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.540
Hey, Itsuki, stop!

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.530
Stop the car!

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:34.310
<i>Yeah, he's daydreaming about her.</i>

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.420
Why are you staring at me?

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.650
You've been weird lately.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.550
I have?

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.620
You never think much,

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.130
yet you've been so preoccupied.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.300
I guess so.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.970
<i>He probably can't stop</i>
<i>thinking about Mogi's soft lips.</i>

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.170
I've been wondering...

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.810
...what's gonna happen to us in the future.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.140
In the future?!

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.610
<i>After kissing comes...</i>

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.180
How can you even bring up
such a shameful subject

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:12.190
in front of the "Lonely Driver"?!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.820
There's only one thing left to do after kissing!

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.030
What's the one thing?

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.960
You know--<i>it</i>!

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.830
What are you talking about?!

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.830
You're not making any sense.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.970
What I mean by the future is...

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:35.110
Never mind. Difficult thoughts
aren't my specialty.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.780
<i>It looks like his daydreaming</i>
<i>can't be easily fixed.</i>

"Welcome to Touge

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.150
No wonder.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.250
It's Keisuke's FD and Kenta's S14.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.680
Kenta is fast down the hill.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.190
His non-turbo S14 is made for it.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.360
Keisuke took him under his wing

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.030
and has been personally training him.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.260
He's our number-two successor.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.840
The battle against the
Night Kids is in two days.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.340
Keisuke shouldn't be wasting time with Kenta.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.780
He must be confident.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.250
I guess Takeshi Nakazato is easy prey.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.880
Keisuke's on fire lately.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.720
Don't you think he's been
driving like Ryosuke lately?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.720
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.960
Ryosuke must be feeling pretty
confident about his brother.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.920
I heard that's why he's not coming to Myogi.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.610
Can I ask you one thing, Keisuke?

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.080
What is it?

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.090
Why aren't we challenging the Eight-Six?

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:29.280
We should have him
come to Akagi for revenge.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.890
--Akagi, huh?
--Sure!

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:38.400
There's no way you'll lose
to the Eight-Six on our turf.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.830
If you won't do it...

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.270
...I will!

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.740
--Forget it, Kenta.
--Why?

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.070
You think he'll beat me?

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.910
Not on Akagi's downhill.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.850
That's beside the point.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.680
You're a Red Sun now, and don't forget it.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.320
We race on our opponents' courses.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.660
I know we do...

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.330
...but I can't take it.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.960
The Eight-Six got the best of us!

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.930
If only we could battle fair and square...

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.600
Please let me take him!

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.430
Be patient!

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.480
Don't worry.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.880
When the opportunity arises,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.380
the person who needs to put
an end to it will do just that.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.120
You mean...

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.820
...Ryosuke will?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.990
Be patient. First, the Night Kids race.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:40.790
Just leave everything to us.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.080
He does seem weird.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.020
See?! He confessed.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.020
He is, indeed, daydreaming.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.020
We gotta do something.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.660
We only have one week until the big race.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:19.220
We're in serious trouble.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:40.350
<i>There was a time when I</i>
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:48.200
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:54.600
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:02.240
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:10.150
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.960
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.130
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:29.230
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:48.860
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:54.930
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.600
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.440
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.680
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:20.050
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.200
<i>This is seriously not good!</i>

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.900
<i>What's not good, Itsuki?</i>

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.570
<i>--The big race is...</i>
<i>--Forget the race!</i>

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.900
<i>He's been daydreaming</i>
<i>about a girl at this crucial time!</i>

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.840
<i>--Daydreaming?</i>
<i>--He and Natsuki did this and that and...</i>

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.900
<i>...maybe they did "it," too!</i>

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.480
<i>--Not that again.</i>
<i>--Huh?</i>

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.520
<i>Next on Initial D: "Fierce Uphill Battle!"</i>

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.150
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
