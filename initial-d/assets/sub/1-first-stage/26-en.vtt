00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.670
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.460
<i>In the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.130
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.800
<i>My body is frozen in a</i>
<i>memory that I can't shake</i>

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.570
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.710
<i>Broken in the night</i>

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.910
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.050
<i>All from someone's whim</i>

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.290
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.160
<i>Break into the night, it's the time</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.830
<i>With scared eyes, I'm lost in the night</i>

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.460
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.100
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.610
<i>Love me so much,</i>
<i>enough that I could fall apart</i>

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.250
<i>If only I could throw everything away</i>

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.920
<i>And just love you</i>

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.320
<i>Then I know I could face the truth</i>

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.780
<i>I'm going at full power,</i>
<i>and he's right on my tail!</i>

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.990
<i>No matter how fast I go, I still can't get away!</i>

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.570
<i>It's no good.</i>

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.500
<i>I might lose this race!</i>

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.870
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi...</i>

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.410
<i>I can't even compare to such a great racer!</i>

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.010
<i>I'm going to lose!</i>

"Act 26: The New Downhill Legend!"

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.390
<i>Amazing!</i>

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.230
<i>I'm getting goose bumps.</i>

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.230
<i>He's following such a perfect line.</i>

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.730
<i>If I weren't right behind him,</i>
<i>copying his every move,</i>

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.540
<i>it would have been almost</i>
<i>impossible for me to do this.</i>

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.250
<i>Beginners can drive fast on a straight line.</i>

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.380
<i>Intermediate drivers can master corners.</i>

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.820
<i>But truly advanced drivers</i>
<i>find their own course,</i>

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.580
<i>and that's how they get ahead.</i>

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.660
<i>To find that ultimate course</i>

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.970
<i>is the main objective of</i>
<i>my "fastest driver" theory.</i>

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.970
<i>I can't believe I've found</i>
<i>the best example of my theory</i>

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.430
<i>on such an occasion, after</i>
<i>searching for it for so long.</i>

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.510
<i>What amazing talent.</i>

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.170
--Here they come!
--Which one is it?

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.360
Ryosuke Takahashi or the Eight-Six?!

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.720
Whoa! What intensity!

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.310
How impressive!

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.550
<i>It's no good! I can't widen the lead!</i>

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300
All right! They're coming!

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.470
Just the sound of it gives me shivers!

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.040
Since the straight section before
the five hairpins is quite long,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.640
I bet there'll be some hard braking.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.090
Here they come! The Eight-Six is in front!

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.820
<i>Ryosuke!</i>

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.330
Entrance to the five hairpins here.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.730
I can see both cars now.
The Eight-Six is leading!

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.030
Wow, the Eight-Six?!

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.270
<i>Too much speed. He messed it up.</i>

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.780
<i>Damn it! Turn!</i>

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.300
<i>He could have powered through it</i>

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.540
<i>and brought it back if he were</i>
<i>driving a more powerful car.</i>

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.630
<i>But how reckless to try it with an Eight-Six!</i>

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.810
Ryosuke's FC took the lead!

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.650
What?!

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.250
When the Eight-Six over-accelerated

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.250
and under-steered, Ryosuke passed it!

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.550
<i>The Eight-Six under-steered?</i>

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.260
He's just amazing!
Ryosuke is in a class by himself!

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.430
Now I am totally sure that
Ryosuke is going to win!

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.320
<i>Such a strange guy...</i>

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.850
<i>What an unexpected weakness!</i>

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.920
<i>I was planning to stay</i>
<i>behind him a little longer</i>

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.090
<i>so I could hide my strengths.</i>

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.530
<i>Now that I'm in front, I don't</i>
<i>want him to get right behind me,</i>

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.030
<i>so before he recovers, I'd better widen the gap</i>

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.020
<i>and guarantee myself the win.</i>

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.390
The FC just passed us.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.620
The Eight-Six is a little behind.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.890
Ryosuke's time is amazing!

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.830
He could beat the course record
by almost twelve seconds!

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.530
<i>Twelve seconds?!</i>

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.840
<i>The race is over.</i>

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.500
<i>My brother will just widen the gap now.</i>

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:04.180
Just hearing about it gives me chills.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.380
Even if he loses, it won't
hurt Takumi's reputation.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.250
It's just that Ryosuke Takahashi
is simply incomparable!

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.920
Wait a minute. The race isn't over yet!

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.490
I still believe that Takumi
can come back and win.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.090
But...

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.760
He always has, hasn't he?!

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.600
No matter how bad it's looked,
he's always come back and won.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.560
I am sure he can do it again!

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.010
<i>Please get to the bottom safely!</i>

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.210
<i>Don't do anything crazy, Takumi!</i>

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:03.140
<i>The merit of a light and compact</i>
<i>rotary engine is not the power,</i>

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.710
<i>but the agility you get from an</i>
<i>ideal front-back weight distribution.</i>

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:16.380
<i>I just love the consistent</i>
<i>spirit of the rotary engine.</i>

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.890
<i>Even if I have to put my pride on the line,</i>

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.980
<i>the rotary engine can't fall behind</i>
<i>the Eight-Six on the corners!</i>

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.810
Whoa!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.520
Aren't Ryosuke Takahashi and Takumi great?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.490
The drift punks around here don't
even come close to that speed.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.360
Sayuki, what's going to happen in this race?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.360
It's impossible to pass
Ryosuke once he's in front.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.470
But it's Takumi he's racing against!

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.300
Takumi hasn't given up yet.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.670
The lines he chooses are better than the FC's.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.840
You can tell he's driven Akina Pass a lot.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:33.330
<i>I thought he would be way</i>
<i>ahead once he passed me!</i>

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.300
<i>I still have a chance!</i>

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.740
<i>I'm getting closer!</i>

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.180
<i>The gap is narrowing!</i>

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.150
<i>Shoot!</i>

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.650
<i>All of a sudden, my front tires</i>
<i>aren't sticking to the road.</i>

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.880
<i>Could it be heat wear?</i>

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.330
<i>Following and copying the Eight-Six's driving</i>

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.490
<i>might have put more strain on</i>
<i>the front tires than I expected.</i>

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.870
<i>The Eight-Six is getting closer...</i>

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.400
<i>Isn't he having any problems with his tires?</i>

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.040
<i>A little wear on the tires won't</i>
<i>affect my technique, though.</i>

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.870
<i>I can't catch him like this.</i>
<i>I need to get closer all at once!</i>

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.620
<i>Darn it! Is this my limit?</i>

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.330
<i>Should I try that thing?</i>

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.160
<i>The "other gutter driving" that</i>
<i>my dad talked about that time?</i>

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.440
Oh, good job.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.420
Hey, Dad. I think I found a good trick

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.680
to avoid skidding on a
curve in snowy weather.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.320
You hook the tires on one side
into the gutter next to the road.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.290
You can corner so easily, it's like a joke.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.460
"Gutter driving," huh?

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.170
I use that technique often, too.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.440
Shoot. You use it too, huh?

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.670
Takumi. There are two ways to
use the gutters in Akina's roads.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.980
The method you discovered is to
use the gutter as you enter the corner

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.380
so you can prevent under-steering.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.790
There's another one. This one
emphasizes recovery after a corner.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.390
The timing for getting both in
and out of the gutter is different.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.690
It's pretty tough. Try and
figure it out for yourself.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.970
<i>I haven't tried it yet.</i>

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.830
<i>It's a big gamble. Should I try it?</i>

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.070
<i>Okay. Here I go!</i>

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.090
What did he just do?!

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.610
<i>What the heck did he just do?!</i>

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.890
It sounds like they're coming, Shingo.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.520
Judging from the skidding sound,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.890
they must be very close to each other.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.460
Just as I expected!

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.400
This is the only spot where
they can go for the win.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.030
The straightaway lets you
speed up for the braking to come.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.040
Unlike the rest of the
narrow mountain pass road,

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.370
this corner has three lanes,
so you can choose your own line.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:44.580
On top of that, this is a compound
corner where two R's overlap.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.280
The finish line is right over there.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.620
This has to be the point
where they go for the win.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.050
The one who leads after this corner
is the one who wins the race!

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.980
Here they come!

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.130
Wow! The FC is in front!

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.560
The Eight-Six is right behind him!

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.100
What will they do?!

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.440
There's no way to pass from the outside!

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.800
Go inside!

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.270
Inside?! Or outside?!

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.080
Outside?!

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.290
<i>Ryosuke didn't leave any room on the inside!</i>

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.580
<i>There was no way to go inside!</i>

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.310
Whoa! The FC is in front!

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.470
The inside has the absolute advantage!

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.150
The FC is skidding to the outside
of the curve! Is this for real?!

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.810
He's going way too fast
to get out of the curve!

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.060
No way!

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.830
Their lines will cross!

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.340
Here they come!

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.570
Here they are!

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.110
No way!

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.120
I can't believe Ryosuke Takahashi is losing!

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.050
That's Takumi's car!

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.090
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.270
It's the Eight-Six! The Eight-Six won!

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.040
I can't believe it! On top of that,

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.540
he set an amazing course record!

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.620
<i>My big brother has lost.</i>

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.750
<i>The legend of the unbeatable man is over.</i>

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.400
Banzai! Takumi won! The Eight-Six won!

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.400
Hooray!

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.480
Whoopee! He did it!

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.680
Banzai! Banzai!

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.960
Hey! Are you listening, Bunta?!

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.360
Takumi has won!

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.800
Don't get so excited. Of course
he won. That's no surprise.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.100
He set an amazing course record, too!

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.590
Right, right. Okay, then. I'm hanging up.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.300
That guy!

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.320
So he won...

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.310
That Takumi...

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.820
We've just seen one heck of a race.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.860
I'm still in a state of shock.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.880
Wow!

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.700
Hey, Shingo! Get farther away from me!

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.200
If someone sees us, they'll think we're friends.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.170
You get away!

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.510
Takumi did it! He beat Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.510
--That is so cool!
--Yeah.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.480
Maybe I'll ask Takumi out again!

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.650
What?

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.980
Why don't you ask that guy out too, Mako?

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.250
What was his name?

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.190
Let's see...

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.020
--Iketani?
--Right! That's him!

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.360
There's still a chance!
Let's go on a double date!

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.280
Um, there's one thing I want to ask...

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.720
Do you mind?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.560
How come you waited for me
to take charge in the race?

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.790
You think I slowed down on purpose

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:03.600
in the last half of the race? No way.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600
But then why...?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.300
You must have picked up your pace a notch.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.770
I tried my best not to slow down,

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.940
but my front tires were acting strange.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:17.410
--Tires?
--But I can't use tires as an excuse...

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.220
Conditions were the same for
both of us, and I clearly lost.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.780
I, uh...

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.560
I don't think that I'm a faster
driver, or anything like that.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.790
You really are weird.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:36.000
I've never met anyone like you before.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.970
Don't be content with winning
on a small stage like Akina.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.440
Turn your gaze towards
the bigger world out there.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.310
Takumi Fujiwara... you were very fast.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.180
See you around.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:26.650 line:50 %
<i>I open a window to the dawn sky</i>

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:34.350 line:50 %
<i>And your bare skin almost</i>

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:34.350 line:50 %
<i>liquid in the soft breeze</i>

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:40.660 line:50 %
<i>Gently I draw you to me, and with each kiss</i>

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.400
--It's autumn already.
--Yeah.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:48.340 line:50 %
<i>My heart trembles like I can hardly believe</i>

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.330
Should we head back, Takumi?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.900
Sure.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.740 line:50 %
<i>The passionate thrill brimming over within</i>

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.380
This car is small but very fast.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:02.050 line:50 %
<i>Knocks on a rusty door</i>

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.980
I think it's really cool. I like it after all.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:08.660 line:50 %
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:08.660 line:50 %
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:15.530 line:50 %
<i>I want to show you how</i>

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:15.530 line:50 %
<i>I feel with my whole body</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:25.530 line:50 %
<i>Let me get drunk on</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:25.530 line:50 %
<i>this love, miraculous flower</i>

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.840
T... Takumi!!!

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.010 line:50 %
<i>Let me get drunk on</i>

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.010 line:50 %
<i>this love, miraculous flower</i>

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.780 line:50 %
<i>There was a time when I</i>

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:31.780 line:50 %
<i>wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.950
You've gotten another challenge!

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:39.620 line:50 %
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.750
This time it's really bad. Oh, man!

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:46.060 line:50 %
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:53.690 line:50 %
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:01.610 line:50 %
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:01.610 line:50 %
<i>I hold you ever so tightly</i>

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:08.450 line:50 %
<i>All I can say is that I believe</i>

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:08.450 line:50 %
<i>my feelings are true</i>

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.590 line:50 %
<i>Let's enjoy our happiness...</i>

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:20.650 line:50 %
<i>Into our shining future</i>

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:40.310 line:50 %
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.080
Here. Now get going.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.680
In half a year or so,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.680
I might become a better driver than you, Dad.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:46.320 line:50 %
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.180
Nonsense.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.420
I'm still better than a baby like you.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.990 line:50 %
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.990 line:50 %
<i>ever so strongly and vividly</i>

00:23:52.990 --> 00:24:00.030 line:50 %
<i>I want to show you even more</i>

00:23:52.990 --> 00:24:00.030 line:50 %
<i>how I feel with my whole body</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:06.710 line:50 %
<i>Bloom like a red rose,</i>

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:06.710 line:50 %
<i>I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:13.550 line:50 %
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,</i>

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:13.550 line:50 %
<i>I will never let you go</i>

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.820 line:50 %
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:25.190 line:50 %
<i>...and miraculous flower</i>

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.410
<i>The big world out there...</i>
