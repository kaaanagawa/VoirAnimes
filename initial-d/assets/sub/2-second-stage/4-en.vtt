<i>It's always like this when Takumi races.</i>

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.110
<i>The tension in the air is the same.</i>

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.480
<i>I always give up on him,</i>

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.640

<i>Iketani and Kenji keep saying</i>

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.720
<i>that Takumi has no chance against the Lan-Evo.</i>

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.050
<i>I wonder if they're right.</i>

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.760
<i>He has defeated all the opponents</i>

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.920
<i>that everyone thought he couldn't beat.</i>

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.270
<i>I can't base it on facts, but...</i>

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.900
<i>...I think he may beat the Evo IV, too.</i>

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
<i>I don't know why, but I'm</i>
<i>suddenly feeling hopeful.</i>

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.080
<i>Right, Takumi?</i>

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.380
<i>I never thought an Eight-Six</i>
<i>could race this well.</i>

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.470
<i>The downhill battle is so deep.</i>

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.990
<i>So fast...</i>

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.480
<i>What a fast car that is!</i>

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230
I just don't understand one thing, Keisuke.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.100
Yeah?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.440
Even if he sticks like super glue,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.770
how can he pass the Evo IV
with his inferior Eight-Six?

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.780
I understand that downhill
minimizes the power difference,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.280
but it can never make
the Eight-Six more powerful.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.450
He's slower on the straightaways,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.550
and since they're equally skilled,
it's almost impossible

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.020
for him to get ahead at a corner.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.890
If he can't get ahead, he'll lose.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.030
Just wait. I don't need to explain it.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.020
What's about to happen right there
is the answer to your question.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.470
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.810
<i>He can't get ahead.</i>

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.640
<i>It's impossible!</i>

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.320
<i>He shortens the gap right</i>
<i>before we enter each corner.</i>

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.320
<i>But it's partly because my front</i>
<i>tires have lost some pressure.</i>

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.600
<i>It's an Eight-Six, after all.</i>

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.940
<i>It has slow acceleration.</i>

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.270
<i>I can always pull away after a turn.</i>

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.040
<i>It pays to be in front, Kyoichi.</i>

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.510
<i>Unless I make a stupid mistake, this race is...</i>

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.780
<i>... 100% mine.</i>

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.350
<i>He's fast.</i>

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.690
<i>He's the fastest I've seen,</i>

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.590
<i>as far as acceleration after a turn is concerned.</i>

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.960
<i>I can't stick with him. He has too much power.</i>

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.660
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.080
<i>Even with the "ditch" turn, I'm falling behind.</i>

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.490
<i>To offset my slow acceleration,</i>

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.660
<i>I have to exit corners at a much</i>
<i>higher speed than he does.</i>

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.690
<i>Then I can catch him before the next corner.</i>

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.000
<i>I guess I have to do what I did</i>
<i>against Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.100
<i>The Ditch Turn No. 2...</i>

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.570
<i>...for faster exit acceleration.</i>

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.110
<i>The corner before the bridge is the place.</i>

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.110
<i>Can I catch the ditch correctly</i>
<i>if I charge in at top speed?</i>

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.840
<i>I have one chance!</i>

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.250
<i>I'm different tonight.</i>

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.060
They're close!

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.560
They're just around the corner.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.360
<i>Honestly...</i>

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.370
<i>...I'm not 100% sure if he</i>
<i>can actually pass the Evo IV.</i>

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.470
<i>I just want to believe</i>
<i>that no one can beat him...</i>

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.540
<i>...when my brother couldn't.</i>

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.370
<i>Don't lose!</i>

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.370
<i>I won't forgive you if you lose</i>
<i>to anyone before our rematch.</i>

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.820
The Eight-Six is behind!

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.650
<i>Now!</i>

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.860
<i>I won! This is the end.</i>

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.400
<i>He disappeared.</i>

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.280
What the heck?!

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.390
He caught the Evo IV at the turn's exit.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.510
What happened?!

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.320
It's over.

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.460
<i>He got inside.</i>

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.630
<i>How?! It's just an old junker,</i>
<i>so how can it be so fast?!</i>

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.210
<i>Damn, I can't control the tires.</i>

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.200
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.920
What an incredible race!
What will happen next?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.090
Nothing. It's over.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:50.260
It was over when he moved next
to the Evo IV before this turn.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.200
There's no way to pass him now.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.540
<i>Man, he showed him up big time.</i>

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.670
<i>You're unreal, Takumi Fujiwara.</i>

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.380
--The Eight-Six is in front!
--He won!

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.280
Akina's Eight-Six has stopped
Team Emperor's sweep!

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.720
Unbelievable. He beat the Lan-Evo.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.450
It's creepy.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.540
<i>I don't feel like I won. Because it's Akina?</i>

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.540
<i>I knew exactly where to attack</i>

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:38.350
<i>and when to use the "ditch" turn.</i>

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.870
<i>I would've lost anywhere else.</i>

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.990
Sorry, Kyoichi.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.830
Do you have any idea why I'm mad, Seiji?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.030
Do you think you can explain

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.840
why you lost this race?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.870
No, I don't. I just couldn't shake him off.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.540
I don't know how that slow
Eight-Six could keep up with me,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.780
or what kind of technique he used.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.280
Of course not.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.490
How could you see anything
in the rearview mirror?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.990
You could've observed
much more from behind.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.990
"Simulation 3" was for that very reason.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.230
Had you listened to me,

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.000
you wouldn't have suffered an ugly loss.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.840
Stop acting like a stupid monkey
and start using your head!

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.370
I apologize.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.370
What do we do now, Kyoichi?

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:43.040
Our plan to sweep Gunma is no more.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.380
But regret won't erase this defeat.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.380
We'll suck it up and head to Akagi next.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.250
The Red Suns?

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.390
My ultimate target is Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.430
If we win in Akagi, I'll be satisfied.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.660
I just have to win.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.660
What about the Eight-Six, Kyoichi?

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.200
We have our pride.
We can't just accept the defeat.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.110
Shut up! You don't have to tell me that!

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.440
Just leave him to me.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.710
<i>I'm the one who is the most upset about this.</i>

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.750
That was so satisfying last night!

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.950
I've never felt that satisfied before.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.290
I remember the Evo IV guy with the ponytail

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.630
trashed us at the lake by saying,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.960
"An Eight-Six racer isn't worthy of my time."

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.200
I wish I could just rub it in his face.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.240
Right, Takumi? Wasn't it satisfying?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.240
It wasn't satisfying.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.970
What? Why not?

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.610
I've had this vague thought lately,

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.110
but it became clear last night.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.480
I don't like racing in Akina.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.450
--I'm done racing here.
--Yeah, right.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.450
When you think, nothing good comes out of it.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.490
What's wrong with Akina?

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.890
I don't think I won the race last night.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.760
I actually feel like I lost.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.270
Hold on, Takumi! Why are you upset?

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.440
I'm not upset.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.270
Declaring my plans to you does no good,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.580
but I'm done with Akina.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.780
I've decided to race elsewhere,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.040
even if it means a defeat.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.890
<i>Again?</i>

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.850
There you are. Hey, Takumi!

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:05.850
Big news! Akagi will be hot this weekend!

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:10.060
Team Emperor and the Red Suns are facing off!

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.690
We can't miss that!

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.330
Rumor has it the guy with the black Lan-Evo

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.200
is racing for Team Emperor.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.100
Ryosuke Takahashi will race for the Red Suns!

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.540
Hey, Takumi, are you listening to me?

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.750
Hey! What's the matter, Takumi?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.680
Nothing.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.600
When Takumi looks spaced out,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.400
that means he's thinking
about something, right, Itsuki?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.110
That's actually very rare.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:01.210
Most of the time, he's just spaced out

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.140
and not thinking about anything.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.980
Which one is it today?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.880
I have no idea, but he's acting weird today.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.550
--A black Evo III!
--Is that him?

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.670
--It's him!
--Emperor!

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.180
Why don't you come to Akagi?

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.920
Come to Akagi and race me.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.920
A challenge!

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:48.120
No. But you guys probably don't get it.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.560
Do you still remember what
I said to you by the lake?

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.090
You're talented,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.930
but you have no chance as
long as you drive an Eight-Six.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.470
That's what I said.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.300
I can show you what I meant by that.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.840
If you race me, you'll see things
you didn't realize before.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.310
Come to Akagi today or tomorrow, if you like.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.310
I'll give you a preliminary race

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.650
before facing the Red Suns.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.150
Unlike the Akina races you're used to,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.150
it'll be a quick defeat for you.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.390
But in that quick race,
you may learn something new.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.760
If you understand me, come to Akagi.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.990
That's all I wanted to say.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.210
What nonsense! Who does he think he is?

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.850
You don't have to go there, Takumi.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.850
I know that.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.780
He acted all cool,

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.790
but I bet he just wants revenge in Akagi.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.360
I bet he does!

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.360
But I've decided not to race in Akina anymore.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.900
What?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.130
If Akagi weren't crowded for
the Emperor-Red Suns challenge,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.040
--I would probably go.
--Takumi!

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.230
I hate for him to think that
I chickened out, but I'll pass.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.930 line:50 %
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.540
I saw it, Bunta.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.610
I saw your son race in Akina.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.110
Considering how good he already is,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.550
this engine will be gone soon.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.050
It'll be sooner than later.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.450
What are you gonna do?

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:01.490
You said you wouldn't
replace it until he lost a race.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.990
I wasn't planning on him lasting this long.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.000
He just refuses to lose.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.030
Will the engine blow first, or will he lose first?

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.130
Either way, the new one is ready to go.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.570
<i>That note...</i>

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.220
<i>...trashed Mogi.</i>

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:38.520
<i>She's dating an older man in a Mercedes...</i>

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.100
<i>What the hell was that, then?</i>

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.150
Hello?

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.690
So, there's no way you'll change your mind?

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.630
No.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.170
<i>A family restaurant near Maebashi?</i>

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.470
<i>Do you really want me to go? Fine.</i>

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.140
Dad, I need to run an errand.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.740
Okay.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.550
<i>I can't get this out of my head.</i>

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:46.360
<i>The more I try to forget it, the more</i>
<i>I think about it and get irritated.</i>

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.600
<i>Maybe I like Mogi that much.</i>

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.370
<i>So...</i>

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.740
<i>...it's silly, but just this once, I'll fall for it.</i>

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.880
<i>This is it.</i>

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.020
<i>A Mercedes.</i>

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.500
Papa, thank you for
understanding my selfishness.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.930
Papa, thank you for
understanding my selfishness.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.870
How's it going, Seiji?

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:40.870
I'm more than ready to go.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.380
I already have a strategy for this course.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.680
It was kind of annoying to
see the Red Suns' lackeys

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.390
timing me at every check point.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:53.050
Ignore them.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.560
As long as you know the course perfectly,

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.560
the strategy's basically the same for any pass.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.700
By the way, do you think he'll come?

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.400
Who knows?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:11.210
I would say there's about
a 40% chance he'll show up.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:14.110
It's more convenient for us if he comes.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.050
The truth is that I want to be
done with these little chores

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.280
--before I face Ryosuke Takahashi.
--Yeah.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.220
Our ultimate goal is to conquer all of Gunma.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.520
Once I defeat Ryosuke,
we're done with Gunma.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.090
But I can't sleep well at night

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.100
knowing that we let one escape in Akina.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.100
Hopefully, I can destroy the
Eight-Six in a warm-up race

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:42.260
and go into the main event refreshed.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.610
That was him that just headed up.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.480
What's he doing in Akagi?

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280

<i>Takumi storms to Akagi!</i>

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.420
