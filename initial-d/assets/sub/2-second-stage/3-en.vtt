00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.290
<i>For we've been nervous with</i>

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.370

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.110

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.240
<i>Let's look for explosive thrills, it's the time!</i>

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.700
They're coming into the first corner.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.540
The Evo IV is following?!

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.760
<i>No matter how well you turn corners...</i>

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.560
<i>...you're just an Eight-Six.</i>

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.880
Anyone driving a junker like
an Eight-Six is beneath me!

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.180
I wouldn't race them even if they asked.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.050
But the car...

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.290
I'd have to say the Eight-Six
is no longer good enough.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.360
We will never lose.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.920
The king of mountain passes is the Lan-Evo!

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.290

"Act 3: Premonition of Defeat"

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.650
With the speed of the Evo IV,
Seiji should take the lead

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.350
before the first corner, despite his late start.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.360
That wasn't even Seiji's full start, though.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.490
He stayed behind on purpose?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.000
Is he on "Simulation 2"?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Offensive-minded Seiji is being very careful.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
No need for that against an Eight-Six.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.170
"Simulation 1" should be enough to beat him.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.340
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.840
<i>Seiji is a top-notch racer, but he's not clever.</i>

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.180
<i>So far, all his races were easy,</i>
<i>so he's getting careless.</i>

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.590
<i>"Simulation 3" is to tighten his loose mind.</i>

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.450
<i>Don't fail me, Seiji.</i>

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.920
<i>Stumbling here before facing Ryosuke...</i>

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.690
<i>...is unacceptable.</i>

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.720
Maybe it's too much to ask.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.660
Basically, the Evo IV is a WRC rally car.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.330
It's light, and is equipped with turbo and 4WD.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.170
On top of that, the driver
has first-class technique.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.940
Takumi can't win.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.840
Come on, Iketani and Kenji!

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.950
Why are you always so
pessimistic about things?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.610
But, Itsuki...

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.720
It's Takumi who is racing!

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.290
Unlike others,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.090
Takumi always makes
something happen when he races.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.750
<i>Damn, I don't like this.</i>

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.050
<i>This is irritating. Damn it!</i>

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.520
Hey, Papa?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.390
I, uh...

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.800
I don't think I should see you anymore.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.420
That's sudden. Can you tell me why?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.550
There's someone I like now.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.100
I mean, I like you, too, Papa.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.370
But this is a different kind of liking.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.370
Sorry I'm so selfish.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.730
<i>This is a joke.</i>

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.170
<i>Why does my Evo IV have to stay cooped up</i>

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.330
<i>behind this ancient Eight-Six?</i>

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.140
<i>I can barely step on the gas.</i>

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.510
<i>I'm getting frustrated.</i>

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.340
<i>"Full Blast" is all that's in my Evo IV dictionary.</i>

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.680
<i>Why use "Simulation 3" against this old junker?!</i>

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.350
<i>He's nowhere near that good, Kyoichi!</i>

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.860
<i>Don't be impatient, Seiji.</i>

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.260
<i>What's this anger? I'm irritated!</i>

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.890
<i>Why am I so irritated?!</i>

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.900
Hey, Keisuke?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.110
What did Ryosuke say about this race?

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.280
He didn't say much.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:06.850
He only told me to be at this
spot if I wanted to watch.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.450
It sounds like there's a reason behind that.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:10.790
Yeah.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.620
It's common sense that the
Eight-Six can't win this battle.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.830
He's racing a Lan-Evo, after all.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.830
Don't act like you know everything, Kenta.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.370
Isn't it also common sense that your S14

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.500
shouldn't be slower than an Eight-Six?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.640
Don't torment him, Keisuke.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.640
The race against the Eight-Six

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.650
turned out to be a great experience for Kenta.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.480
Yeah, what do I care?

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.250
"Emperor" or whatever they're called,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.920
one thing will be certain after this battle

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.360
against Takumi Fujiwara on Akina's downhill.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.370
<i>This is the longest straightaway on this course.</i>

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.730
<i>I can easily get ahead of him if I want.</i>

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.970
If you get impatient and jump ahead, it's over.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.270
Damn it! I've had enough of this!

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.620
That's how everyone lost,
including my brother.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.620
If you jump ahead, you lose?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.820
Right. Can you understand
that paradox, Kenta?

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.160
Here I go!

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.730
<i>"Simulation 3" or not, Kyoichi...</i>

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.170
...I just have to win this race, right?!

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.310
<i>He's fast.</i>

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.020
<i>Now you'll see how outclassed you are.</i>

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.750
<i>I'll just keep blasting away</i>

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.250
<i>until you disappear from my rearview mirror.</i>

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.690
<i>See ya, Eight-Six!</i>

"Mt. Akina Forest Park Skate Center"

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.080
Would you please reconsider?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.250
You really make my life worth living.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.520
I really don't mind if you have a boyfriend,

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.420
as long as we stay the same.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.060
I know, I can give you more gifts.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.460
Papa, stop.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.930
It's not that.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.910
I've always liked you, Papa.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.210
Despite our age difference,

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.380
I thought it was normal to have

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.250
a relationship with the person I liked, but...

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.250
...now that I think about it,

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.990
that's why you were giving me gifts.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.820
This can't be normal.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.700
Do you really like this boy...

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.600
...that much?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.500
I probably do.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.840
Right now, that's all I can say.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.340
What? Seiji got ahead of the Eight-Six?!

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.450
--He's pulling away!
--All right!

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.540
I knew it.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.090
That's the Seiji we know. He's gone now!

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.790
--That Eight-Six is nothing!
--Yeah!

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.860
Despite his looks, Seiji is highly skilled.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.350
He won't lose now.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.900
Idiot!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.940
<i>Seiji has mastered driving his Lan-Evo fast.</i>

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.110
<i>He knows that a 4WD car has to enter a corner</i>

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.010
<i>at top speed to be able to drift through it.</i>

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.500
<i>During the drift, you can only control the car</i>

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.530
<i>by steering while flooring the gas pedal.</i>

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.100
<i>The car tends to fishtail if you try to control it</i>

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:26.040
<i>with the pedal like you would an FR.</i>

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.780
<i>Full acceleration is the 4WD's way.</i>

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:36.280
<i>That's the hardest thing</i>
<i>about driving a 4WD car.</i>

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.960
<i>No mediocre racer can turn with full control.</i>

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.130
<i>But once you master the technique,</i>

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.290
<i>you can turn any corner</i>
<i>at remarkably high speed.</i>

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.270
<i>I guess I don't have to worry about Seiji, but...</i>

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.910
<i>...why am I feeling so anxious?</i>

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.160
<i>Enter with speed and turn with full acceleration.</i>

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.560
<i>It's completely different from</i>
<i>the junker FR's slow "crab" turn.</i>

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.200
<i>Watch me and learn.</i>

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.270
<i>Of course, he has to be close by to see it.</i>

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.440
<i>I doubt he's anywhere near me.</i>

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.070
<i>He's so far...</i>

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.340
<i>What?!</i>

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.850
<i>He's right behind me instead of far back!</i>

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.350
<i>That's impossible!</i>

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.120
<i>He can keep up with my drift?</i>

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.080
<i>He's better than I thought. I see.</i>

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.660
<i>I get it now.</i>

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.930
<i>My irritation didn't come</i>

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.760
<i>from not being able to</i>
<i>speed up on the straightaways.</i>

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.870
<i>I guess I was aware of the actual reason</i>

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.740
<i>while I was following him.</i>

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.110
<i>I hate to admit it, but I... I...</i>

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.510
<i>I'm slower at corners!</i>

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.250
<i>So far, I've managed to keep up with him.</i>

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.870
<i>There's one more thing.</i>

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.470
<i>The straightaways are shorter around here,</i>

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.670
<i>and the difference in power</i>
<i>doesn't matter much.</i>

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.370
<i>But just wait.</i>

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.710
<i>In the upcoming high-speed section,</i>

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.050
<i>I'll erase you from my rearview mirror.</i>

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.850
<i>I bet my Lan-Evo racer's pride on it!</i>

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.430
<i>At the end of a long,</i>
<i>accelerating straightaway</i>

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.270
<i>waits a hairpin turn.</i>

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.600
<i>That's how it is.</i>

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.440
<i>Here it comes.</i>

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.240
<i>I'll outrace you with my technique,</i>

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.680
<i>not my machine's capabilities.</i>

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.830
He's fast. He certainly is!

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.660
That's a very fast car.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.970
They'll be here shortly.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.150
Here they come!

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.720
The Lan-Evo is ahead. He's charging in!

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.980
Akina's famous five hairpin turns.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.070
What power!

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.200
It's like a WRC car.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:54.610
The Eight-Six is way behind.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.110
I've never seen him this far behind

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.610
at the five hairpins in past races.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.880
Maybe the Eight-Six can't pull it off this time.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.390
That car is too inferior.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.290
There!

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.850
<i>It's time to use the ditch!</i>

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.970
That was fast.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.070
How did he turn so fast?

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.140
See that, Masashi? That's Bunta's son.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.150
You're kidding me!

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.820
It sure looked like Bunta was driving it.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.820
The sound alone shows how great he is.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.830
He was flooring the pedal for a long time.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.260
No normal 18-year-old has skills like that.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.430
Like father, like son.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.330
But...

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.700
...that kind of driving
sure is rough on the engine.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.680
<i>These are tough turns.</i>

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.660
<i>But I don't think I lost any time.</i>

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.160
<i>No matter the car...</i>

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.690
<i>...any driver would lose speed on these turns.</i>

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:35.330
<i>I should be safe with this much of a lead.</i>

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:40.840
<i>What?!</i>

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.850
What happened? This can't be!

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.970
This is humiliating.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.140
I can't shake him off,

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.210
even with my technique and power!

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.040
What is this?!

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.380
Punk...

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.510
Don't insult me!

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.960
It's almost time.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.230
I wonder who's ahead,
the Lan-Evo or the Eight-Six?

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.200
Keisuke, you said earlier

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.700
that the Lan-Evo would lose if he was in front.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.380
I know from my own experience

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.550
that he won't let you run away with the lead.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.710
He sticks right with you like super glue.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.390
If you get irritated and rely on the car's power

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.090
to shake him off, the tires deflate.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.560
<i>Damn, he's right on me.</i>

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.570
The key is how you use the tires.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.070
Anyone who jumps ahead
without knowing that...

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.870
...will lose.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.080
<i>The front tires are losing pressure.</i>

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.380
<i>This is irritating. I just can't stay focused.</i>

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.860
<i>Don't panic. No need to shake him off.</i>

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.290
<i>I'll win if I keep my lead.</i>

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.900
<i>I'm certainly in a more favorable position.</i>

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.570
<i>No matter how fast he can turn,</i>
<i>he can't pass me at a corner.</i>

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.870
<i>And I'm way faster on the straightaways!</i>

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.780
<i>I wasn't wrong.</i>

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.450
<i>Taking the lead back there was the right move.</i>

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.250
<i>I'm the winner, Kyoichi!</i>

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.750
<i>The end is near. What did Takumi</i>
<i>decide during this tough race?</i>

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.920
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.690
<i>"Hollow Victory."</i>

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.250
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
