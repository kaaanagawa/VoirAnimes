--Kazumi!
--Itsuki?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.340
Why are you here?

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.040
A lot's happened since last night.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.170
You're the one who chose this location.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.450
Kazumi, you guys wait here.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.190
But why?

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.630
You can catch a bus or a train
from here in the morning.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.130
If anything should happen to our cars,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.230
at least you won't be stuck here.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.760
What?! Takumi!

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.810
Are you guys going to Shomaru Pass?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.640
You shouldn't race there!

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.480
--Pick another place!
--Be quiet, Kazumi.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.980
Stay out of this.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.880
--Big brother...
--Just so you know...

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.720
...the pass we're about to race
on is very narrow and tricky.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.660
I'll take the lead first.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.990
Since this is your first time,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.200
we should take some precautions.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.370
We'll alternate positions

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.870
and keep going until one pulls away

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.870
or passes the other.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.040
It's a sudden death race.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.680
If we're equally skilled,
another element will be the factor.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.410
Another element?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.210
Luck, stamina,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.720
compatibility with the car... that sort of thing.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.020
Let's go.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.850
When we get there,
I'll turn on my hazard lights

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.850
and we'll start.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.840
<i>Takumi!</i>

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.310
<i>Did Takumi know that</i>
<i>Kazumi would be here, too?</i>

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.020
Is Shomaru Pass really that dangerous?

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.030
It's an old road.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.990
It's not that long,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.830
but you go uphill first,
then downhill from the middle.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.330
It's half uphill, then.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.540
That's not all.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.840
It's narrow and has poor visibility,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.670
which has resulted in many accidents.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.740
The guardrails are all rusted.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.080
The road's uneven and slippery.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.920
Wataru has had two accidents there.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.090
He said it was a tough pass to race.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.590
What?!

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.520
This is Takumi's first time!

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.390
It's too risky!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.500
<i>His hazard lights! Here we go...</i>

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.630
<i>Ready? Don't crash your precious car yet.</i>

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.010
<i>It's an uphill.</i>

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.390
What?!

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.660
I told you so.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.500
It's a great engine.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.200
You can even stay with me on this hill.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.000
No need to take it easy, then!

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.510
--Good night!
--Bye! Take care.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.690
<i>I'm sorry, Takumi.</i>

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.460
<i>I'm the one who's to blame.</i>

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.290
<i>I know that now,</i>

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.700
<i>but I don't know what to do.</i>

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.830
<i>So for now, I'll try working</i>
<i>part-time like you, Takumi.</i>

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.960
<i>I'm determined to change.</i>

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.020
<i>I drive an Eight-Six</i>

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.090
<i>because defeating an opponent</i>
<i>with this disadvantageous old car</i>

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.390
<i>is so satisfying.</i>

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.200
<i>But this time, it's different.</i>

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.230
<i>I absolutely can't lose to another Eight-Six!</i>

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.600
<i>I've never felt this much</i>
<i>pressure in a race before!</i>

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.870
<i>I can see the aura that</i>
<i>radiates from your Trueno!</i>

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.980
Is this a good spot, Keisuke?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.940
The course is so narrow that
there's no other place to watch from.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.020
<i>There!</i>

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.300
Here we go!

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.300
<i>That sudden boost of power is to die for!</i>

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.990
The obsolete "boom" turbo.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.320
Hey, Keisuke?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.830
Aren't Fujiwara's Trueno and Akiyama's Levin

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.700
basically the same car except for
their front and tail lamp designs?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.000
--Yeah.
--Why do they run differently, then?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.100
Well, that's because...

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.440
I should have my brother explain it to you.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.110
I understand it in my head,
but I'm not good at explaining.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.320
Like Kenta said, the Trueno
and the Levin are like twins.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.320
But since their engines take
different tuning methods,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.960
they've become two completely different cars.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.550
The method without the turbocharger
is called mechanical tuning.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.020
Fujiwara's Trueno is that.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:36.970
His foot on the gas pedal
controls the rpm directly.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.910
Its instant response is its strength.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.910
Even after entering a corner
at nearly top speed,

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.910
he can make further adjustments to his attack.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.220
Unlike with a turbo,

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.250
he can attack corners aggressively.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.030
Cars like his excel at entering corners.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.660
In contrast, Akiyama's Levin is a turbo.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.230
It may be a step slower at corners,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.570
but its acceleration on
straightaways covers that.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.840
Cars with turbos excel
at coming out of corners.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.510
How about the Levin's fishtailing, then?

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.510
The "boom" turbo tends to lag,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.850
so once the boost pressure goes down,

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.350
it takes time to get it back up.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.190
That's why he keeps his foot
on the gas when exiting corners

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.260
and controls it using counter-steer only.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.560
He probably mastered
that fishtailing technique

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.970
to deal with the peculiarities of his car.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.970
Got it, Kenta?

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.640
Pass racing is very complex.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.440
Yes, I get it now.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.020
What's up with that?!

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.220
Are you sure this is the place?

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.560
Yeah, I guess so.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.360
What's that?

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.260
Takumi!

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.800
Wow! That's a "boom" turbo.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.900
That car almost looks out of control.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.600
He's barely staying on this narrow road.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.940
But when he's on, he's super fast.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.610
He's a different kind of opponent

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.240
who breaks all the conventional rules.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.680
<i>This is the second round.</i>

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.190
<i>From behind, I'll be observing</i>

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.320
<i>your undefeated Gunma-grown talent.</i>

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.000
This corner is hard to get through!

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.610
Right now, all the elements
are against Fujiwara.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:35.910
It's a tricky course where
he has no experience,

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.110
and the Levin's irregular
pace breaks his rhythm.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.850
But more than anything,

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.690
he has been feeling uneasy

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.960
with his new and unfamiliar Eight-Six.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.520
That's his biggest handicap.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.600
<i>The bad condition of this road</i>
<i>is making my car shake!</i>

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.210
<i>The inner edge of the road is unusable!</i>

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.370
<i>If the tires catch it, they'll slip!</i>

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.320
<i>I can't use the outer edge</i>
<i>coming out of corners, either.</i>

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.190
<i>There's less usable area on this</i>
<i>road than there appears to be.</i>

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.030
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:29.830
<i>The suspension settings change</i>
<i>based on the engine power.</i>

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.570
<i>After I installed the new engine,</i>

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.440
<i>you kept saying you couldn't corner like before,</i>

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.840
<i>which is logical.</i>

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.000
<i>The car was set up that way.</i>

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.510
<i>Only by revving up to a</i>
<i>high rpm will you be able</i>

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.070
<i>to corner at a higher speed.</i>

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.720
<i>Notice that, Takumi.</i>

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.450
<i>Unseal the car's capabilities.</i>

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.470
<i>What's this?</i>

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.130
<i>Did I imagine it?</i>

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.320
<i>The turbo is so fast that I'm kind of scared.</i>

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.520
This car is nothing like it was before.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.820
It needs more detailed maintenance.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.530
And I have to watch the
gauges while I'm racing.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.600
It costs money and takes effort,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.500
but I have no regrets.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.900
I've gained the power I was craving.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.570
See, Kazumi...

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.340
...it's no good if you stop growing.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.680
If you keep running away
from things you're bad at,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.350
you'll never be good at anything.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.020
You just have to keep searching

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.780
and moving forward on your own two feet.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.120
Big brother...

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.790
Kazumi?

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.960
Oh, thank you.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.950
It's warm.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.400
--Listen, Itsuki.
--Yeah?

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.140
I don't think I'll be going back to Gunma.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.980
So...

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.080
...I guess this is probably good-bye for us.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.710
What?!

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.030
My parents found out about
my leaving work the other day

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.660
and are angry with me.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.330
But that's not the reason.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.000
I was thinking in the car.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.010
I realized that I need to choose my own path.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.240
Because only if I choose my own path

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.840
can I say to myself that I was right in the end.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.950
My old job, and this temp job at the hotel,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.990
weren't really my idea.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.320
I'll find a job myself this time.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.820
And I also have a small goal.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.630
A goal?

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.170
I'll save up and get my
driver's license, like you.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.870
That'll be my first step towards independence.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.180
I was wrong to think that
moving to another place

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.920
would solve my problems.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.880
I want to hold the steering wheel

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.690
instead of sitting in the passenger seat.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.090
I want to be able to run on my own,

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.730
without anyone's help.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.330
Kazumi, I, uh...

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.000
I won't go back to Gunma,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
because I can't get my license there.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Uh, I...

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.000
Thank you for everything, Itsuki.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.780
<i>I...</i>

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.620
<i>...have fallen in love with you, Kazumi.</i>

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.050
The second round!

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.900
He's getting used to it.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.240
What?

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.800
It's time for the new Eight-Six to wake up.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.740
It did get easier to control.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.310
<i>I was struggling with it just yesterday.</i>

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.020
<i>Is it because of this power?</i>

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.760
<i>I can control it.</i>

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.670
<i>All right.</i>

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.570
<i>I may just pull it off!</i>

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.610
<i>I was planning to just</i>
<i>observe him in this round,</i>

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.340
<i>but that won't work.</i>

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:13.110
<i>He's adapting to this tricky</i>
<i>course at an amazing rate.</i>

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.520
<i>No other first-timer could race this fast here!</i>

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.320
<i>I'm impressed!</i>

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.650
<i>Racers like you do exist!</i>

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.790
<i>I can't lose on my home turf!</i>

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:27.490
<i>This will be a tough race!</i>

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.870
Make sure to rev up to 11,000 rpm.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.330
<i>Good pass racers are the coolest.</i>

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.830
<i>You're not bad.</i>

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.170
<i>Your sharp technique could convince anyone.</i>

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.430
<i>I can go for broke with my Levin!</i>

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.210
<i>I wanted excitement like this.</i>

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.910
<i>I'm the luckiest man alive!</i>

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.530
<i>At the end of the last round,</i>
<i>I was going full blast.</i>

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.740
<i>I'll finish you in this round!</i>

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.710
<i>You're a great opponent.</i>

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.040
<i>You've set my spirit on fire!</i>

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Furikaereba itsudatte</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>Kawaranu kimi no egao ga atta</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>Arukitsukare tachidomaru hi mo</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>Chiisa na yorokobi no hi mo</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>Kono ryoute ni kakaekirenai</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>Ai wo oshiete kureta</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>Atatakaku</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Sotto yasashiku yomigaeru kaze wa</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>Ima hitori sora wo</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>Mitsumeteru boku ni hohoendeiru</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>Mada ano hi no mama no</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Mabushisa de te wo futteiru</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>Kimi wa everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.980
<i>Each with their own hopes...</i>

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.850
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.760
<i>The last episode: "Changing Seasons."</i>

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.090
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
