What?!

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.910
No way! He passed Takeshi easily.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.240
That Evo IV is good!

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.680
Takeshi's R32 fell behind.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.110
The Evo IV seems to be pulling away.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.920
What the...?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370
What the heck is that Lan-Evo thinking?

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.960
<i>Against a skilled Myogi racer,</i>

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.090
<i>he chose to be in front, which is unfavorable.</i>

<i>Confidence?</i>

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.400
<i>Or is he just an idiot?</i>

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.530
This race is just starting!

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.170
Big brother, are you in there?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.980
What is it, Keisuke?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.520
The Lan-Evo team is racing at Mt. Myogi.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.390
I just got the news.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.890
Against the Night Kids' Nakazato?

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.000
I suppose.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.730
Who's going to win, big brother?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.510
Just this once, I'm rooting for Nakazato to win.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.030
The Lan-Evo's vulgar spoiler
makes me want to puke.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.410
Nakazato's strength lies in his boldness

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.690
and his offensive driving method.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.620
When he's on, he's fast,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.220
but he tends to crack under pressure.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.460
I sure hope he's recovered

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.120
from the loss he suffered against you.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.370
<i>This isn't happening!</i>
<i>But the race is far from over!</i>

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.750
<i>If I don't stop them...</i>

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.480
<i>...who will?!</i>

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.900
Damn it!

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.070
We get your team sticker, as promised.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.080
In no time, my Evo IV's spoiler will be covered

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.060
with the torn stickers of
all the teams in Gunma.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.460
Don't start celebrating yet!

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.800
There are many fast racers in Gunma!

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.070
That sounds to me like
the pathetic cry of a loser.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.500
--Let's go, Seiji.
--Yeah.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.070
By the way...

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.510
...from now on, you pull
over whenever you see

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.310
a car with the Emperor sticker on it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.560
Takeshi... I still can't believe he was
faster than you in an uphill battle.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.740
The Lan-Evo team defeated the Night Kids.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.010
What? Seriously?

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.680
That's all anyone's talking about this morning.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.020
Nakazato's R32 crashed into a wall
and suffered severe damage.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.050
That's tragic.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.220
Things have been rough
for the Night Kids lately.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.020
I feel bad for them.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.830
I heard that the Lan-Evo squad is planning

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.160
to conquer Gunma within a month.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.570
I'm sure they'll come to Akina, too.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.240
What do we do if they come here?!

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.240
We have no choice but to face them.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.340
We're Akina's team, so if they challenge us,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.250
I have no intention of running away.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.710
I've already switched my S13's tires

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.720
to ones with better grip.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.020
I informed the team members already.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.690
Thank you very much.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.660
Takumi.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.990
They may specifically challenge
you to a downhill battle,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.990
but you can just ignore them.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.900
Your undefeated streak is our pride.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.100
I'd hate to ruin it against a Lan-Evo.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.280
You're not officially a Speed Star, either.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.350
I want you to keep winning, too.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.680
The Lan-Evo is no joke.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.720
It's like racing against a WRC rally car.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.820
Its light body is equipped
with turbo and 4WD.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.490
It has no real weaknesses.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.230
That car shouldn't be allowed on any pass.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.470
I hate to...

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.500
I hate to avoid a race.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.230
I want to race them, too.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.980
Takumi, you sound like a true racer now!

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.050
You're my true friend! I love it!

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.920
I'm positive you'll win!

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.320
The Lan-Evo is going down!

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.160
Is that wise?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.990
Right now, his chance of winning is...

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.900
...zero percent.

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.040
Upgrading the Eight-Six?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.270
That came out of nowhere, Yuichi.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.710
I'm sure it's crossed your mind.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.050
Since Takumi is evolving into a fine racer,

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.380
I feel like it's about time to upgrade

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.880
the Eight-Six's capabilities to match his needs.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.290
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not telling you what to do.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.230
I just want to know your plans.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.230
I guess this engine is getting old,

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.370
and it's about time to overhaul it.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.810
Yeah.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.240
Actually...

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.740
...I have one already.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.240
What?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.980
Is that true?

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.080
Yeah, I happened to get an incredible thing

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.750
from an unlikely source.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.320
An incredible thing?

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.730
All right, I'll show it to you. Get in the car.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.750
You'll get chills.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.790 line:50 %
"Suzuki Motors"

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.210
This is incredible! This is gold!

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.380
You got chills, didn't you?

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.720
More than that. It blew me away!

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.990
How did you manage to get this?

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.460
I'm already psyched about the
idea of this in the Eight-Six.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.030
Me, too.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.660
I haven't felt this excited in a while.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.000
It's almost too good for Takumi, isn't it?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.160
When are you putting it in?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.000
We'll see.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.640
A better engine won't
automatically make the car better.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.010
I'll need to adjust many things
and fine-tune the "footwork."

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.020
With the right balance,
it'll be an incredible machine.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.190
I'll test it myself and come up
with the best configuration.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.020
I'll need your help then, Masashi.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.390
No problem, but you're so darn stubborn.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.900
You never compromise.

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.670
This is like the old days.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.770
But there is one more thing

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.860
Takumi hasn't accomplished in that car.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.040
What is that?

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.010
Nothing, really.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.780
Stop teasing and tell us.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.190
I'll tell you, but you have to promise me

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.880
not to tell Takumi about this.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.290
We won't tell him.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.390
Then I'll tell you.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.760
That one thing is...

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.230
...losing a race.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.570
What do you mean?

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:50.610
Takumi has tried so hard
to remain undefeated.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.080
That's what I don't like.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.820
As long as he's winning,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.950
he won't have a true
appreciation for this upgrade.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.390
He needs to push the car's
capabilities to the very limit

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.390
and find out that it's still
not good enough to win.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.230
There's a lesson to be learned

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.670
in that humiliation.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.840
Until he loses...

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.900
...I can't upgrade the Eight-Six.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.960
At this rate,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.440
the side of the spoiler
will be covered in no time.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.310
It's kind of fun if I think of it as a game.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.980
But I wanna race more capable racers.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.750
Where's our next target, Kyoichi?

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.380
Tomorrow night, we'll head to Akina.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.680
Akina's Eight-Six... how boring!

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.060
I don't mind doing it myself, Seiji.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.330
What?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.560
Kyoichi will race him? Why?

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.330
I don't know.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.370
Our ultimate target...

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.170
...is Ryosuke Takahashi of the Akagi Red Suns.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.230
But before that, we'll defeat Akina's Eight-Six.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.050
I went to see the course yesterday.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:34.010
The slope is severe.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.220
My Evo III is lighter and better suited for it.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.620
You kidding me? Let me take him, Kyoichi.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.860
No matter where I race, I won't lose to anyone.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:51.130
There is only one car that
my Evo IV can't beat, Kyoichi.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.620
It's your Evo III.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.980
Team Emperor's ace is not
needed against an Eight-Six.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.600
I'll do it.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.760
What's this?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.660
"Do you know that Natsuki Mogi

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.860
is dating an older man
in a Mercedes for money?"

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.870 line:50 %
"...Natsuki Mogi..."

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.100 line:50 %

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.240
Takumi!

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.880
--Ready to go?
--Yeah.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.620
What do you have there?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.680
It's nothing.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.860
Hey, Takumi?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.530
This car magazine I bought recently

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.360
has a feature article on the Evo IV,

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.600
so maybe you should read it.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.140
You may be battling against one.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.470
No, thanks.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.910
Why? I'm sure it'll be very helpful.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.210
I probably wouldn't know what to do

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.810
with the knowledge after reading the article.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.820
How can I drive the Eight-Six faster?

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.490
That's all I think about.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.010
It doesn't matter which car I go up against.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:31.600
Haven't you ever considered getting
a more powerful engine or something?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.000
Not really.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.100
Seriously? I'm dying for more
power for my Eight-Five!

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.580
A more powerful engine...

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.530
I have no clue.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:24.320
--Takumi!
--What's going on, Iketani?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.390
They're coming to Akina.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.150
Tonight.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.220
Here comes the Lan-Evo squad!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.500
This will be an incredible battle.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.620
Here they come! The Lan-Evo squad!

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.530
That white Evo IV in front must be the one

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.470
that defeated Nakazato in Myogi.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.000
Rumor has it that he's ridiculously fast.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.320
I knew it! The guys I met at Akina Lake!

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.520
So you're the Speed Stars.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.660
I'm Sudo, the leader of Team Emperor.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.060
I'm sure you already know
that we have only one demand.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.830
A downhill race against your Eight-Six.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.340
That's all.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.110
We'll accept all your demands.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:56.210
Any number of races, of any type,
under any conditions.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.780
But if you fail to win even one race,

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.020
we'll take your team sticker. Understood?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.390
Our sticker?

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.390
--What are they gonna do with it?
--No idea.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:11.630
--It's okay, right?
--We accept.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.460
Then let's get right to the race.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.130
We don't have much time.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.800
The first race is the main downhill race.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.670
Have your Eight-Six ready.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.640
Who's racing for you?

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.910
I am, and I drive an Evo IV.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.350
Iketani, they said they were
ready for more than one race...

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.690
...so who's racing after Takumi?

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.330
If Takumi loses, I'll race next.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:52.030
If he can beat Takumi, I sure
won't be able to beat him...

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:56.440
...but we can't accept defeat without a fight.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.270
Then I'll race after you.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:04.450
We've been relying on Takumi too much lately.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.850
Let's show him that we're capable, too!

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:09.440
Yeah!

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.980
I'm counting on you, our leadoff man!

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.990
Go get him!

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.970
Here comes Fujiwara Tofu Shop!

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.130
The Eight-Six vs. the Evo IV!

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.150
Good luck, Gunma's downhill hero!

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.090
Don't take this lightly, Seiji.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.020
Go with "Simulation 3."

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.690
What? Are you serious?

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.100
"Simulation 3" against an Eight-Six?

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.370
That's right.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.500
<i>I can tell. I felt his energy.</i>

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.340
<i>This Eight-Six is capable. He's not a fake.</i>

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.440
<i>He has something that</i>
<i>made him defeat Ryosuke.</i>

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.310
<i>Until we know what it is,</i>
<i>we can't let our guard down.</i>

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.780
I'll count down.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.120
No, no need for that.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.120
This is a race, not a time trial.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.630
The one with less engine power
can start whenever he likes.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.960
The other starts accordingly.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.700
We'll start late,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.970
but that's our handicap for
having more horsepower.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.470
We call it the "Handicap Method."

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.480
What do you say?

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.040
If it's okay with you, Takumi.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.190
<i>I saw him once by Akina Lake.</i>

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.260
<i>It never occurred to me</i>
<i>that a young kid like him</i>

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.420
<i>was the driver of Akina's Eight-Six.</i>

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:02.230
<i>Kyoichi has developed three strategies to win</i>

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.000
<i>on an opponent's course.</i>

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.900
<i>"Simulation 3" is only used</i>
<i>against the toughest opponents,</i>

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.510
<i>so why use it against this Eight-Six?</i>

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.500
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.050
Takumi zoomed out!

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.420
Go, Takumi!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.570
I won't show you how great the Evo IV is...

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.760
...but how incredible I am!

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Furikaereba itsudatte</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>Kawaranu kimi no egao ga atta</i>

<i>Arukitsukare tachidomaru hi mo</i>

<i>Chiisa na yorokobi no hi mo</i>

<i>Kono ryoute ni kakaekirenai</i>

<i>Ai wo oshiete kureta</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850

<i>The race has begun!</i>

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:09.980
<i>Does Seiji understand the reason</i>
<i>for using "Simulation 3"?</i>

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.220
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.720
<i>"Premonition of Defeat."</i>

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.550
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
