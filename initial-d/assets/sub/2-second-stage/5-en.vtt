"Act 5: Countdown to Destruction"

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.760
Akina's Eight-Six?!

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.110
Did you see that, big brother?!

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.780
Yeah. I guess...

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.180
...Kyoichi is scheming behind the scenes.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.220
Can we let him race the Emperor?

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
There's no way he can pull it off this time!

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.160
This is street racing.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.060
It's not up to us to decide

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.400
who gets to race whom.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.590
But, big brother...

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.880
In the race I saw,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.450
he totally exceeded my expectations.

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.620
I can't believe he's only 18.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.850
Come on, now.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.220
When I was 18, I was far
more capable than that.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.750
You may be the only one who thinks so.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.060
Yuichi says your son is more talented than you.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.300
He says you just don't want
to accept your son's talent

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.890
because you're so stubborn.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.710
Anyway, when he exceeds his limits,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.310
so will the engine.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.380
Sooner or later, it'll blow.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.410
Can he keep winning until then?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.740
Who knows?

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.510
Here's the Eight-Six.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.380
He took the bait as expected.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.410
Thank you for showing up.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.120
As promised, I'll be your opponent.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.890
That's the least I can do for your trouble.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.900
But I won't take it easy.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.390
My courtesy to you is to give it my best.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.980
<i>His attitude is different.</i>

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.420
<i>He looks like a different person.</i>

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.350
Let's go. We'll use the
"Handicap" method like before.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.820
You go first.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.060
The race starts after the first corner.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.540
See you later. Call me if you need me.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.230
Yeah.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.720
<i>Something's gonna happen tonight.</i>

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.190
<i>I have this uneasy feeling.</i>

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.070
The Emperors came to rile up Takumi?!

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.540
They showed up here?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.380
I bet they really regret
losing to Takumi in Akina.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.820
After all, they came to Gunma
planning to sweep the area.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.420
What did Takumi say?

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.490
He's not interested.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.660
That's good.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.490
He has no reason to go to Akagi

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.200
and battle it out with that monstrous Lan-Evo.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.530
Yes.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.530
Okay, I see.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.610
This is weird.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.110
What's wrong, Itsuki?

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.110
Takumi isn't home.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.280
He got a phone call, and then he just took off.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.450
A phone call?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.120
I forgot to set my VCR to tape a show tonight,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.520
so I wanted to ask him to tape it for me.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.190
Did he take the car?

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.620
I think so.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.190
I know! He has a date!

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.160
With that girl.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.500
Natsuki Mogi?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.530
That's her. I'm positive.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.870
I envy him.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.140
If I had a cute girl like that,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.210
I wouldn't be killing time here with you.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.050
What are you saying, Kenji?!

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.380
We racers don't need girls!

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.320
--Right, Iketani?
--Right!

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.510
<i>They're pathetic!</i>

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.100
I want you to know that I
don't consider this a race.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.410
I'm going to teach you the
difference between a fun car...

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.450
...and a fast car.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.580
This is a seminar.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.890
I'm ready.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.960
There he goes!

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.480
Go get him, Kyoichi!

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.880
<i>This is hard for me to comprehend.</i>

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.520
<i>He intentionally threw himself</i>

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.080
<i>into this unevenly matched race.</i>

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.360
<i>How can an obsolete Eight-Six</i>

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.030
<i>defeat Kyoichi's perfectly tuned Evo III?</i>

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.330
<i>And this isn't Akina, either.</i>

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.070
<i>Is that guy too stupid to realize that?</i>

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.640
<i>Does he trust his instincts</i>
<i>and experience that much?</i>

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.980
<i>I don't understand what he's thinking.</i>

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.720
<i>Or does he believe he</i>
<i>actually has a chance to win?</i>

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.390
<i>Maybe he is...</i>

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.450
<i>...a racing genius in the making!</i>

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.150
Unbelievable! They're really racing!

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.660
<i>Watch me, Ryosuke.</i>

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.500
<i>4WD cars can't lose to 2WD cars.</i>

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.670
<i>This race also serves as a</i>
<i>challenge sent out to you.</i>

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.810
Watch out! He's swinging wide!

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.870
That Eight-Six is amazing!

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.210
He was just inches from
that vine-covered guardrail!

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.050
Is he insane?!

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.980
Even Akagi racers don't
attack that corner like that!

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.600
Big brother... the Evo III's noisy
backfire didn't sound normal.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.700
I noticed that, too.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.840
That Evo III has the same system

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.200
that a WRC rally car has.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.710
The misfiring system!

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.880
It's a good strategy by Kyoichi.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.880
It's the best system imaginable

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.290
for a turbo car on a downhill course.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.290
Akagi's slope is much more severe

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.860
than those of Akina and Myogi.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.190
Right after the start is a low-speed section

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.530
where they go straight down the hill

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.600
in a short amount of time.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.740
Controlling the braking and steering

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.070
rather than abusing the power is the key.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.780
He developed his technique
in the Gymkhana circuit,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.580
so he's exceptional at slow corners.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.280
He certainly has better technique now

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.450
than he did a year ago.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.910
This new Kyoichi is a tough opponent.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:12.730
<i>The belief that 4WD cars can't turn is obsolete.</i>

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.170
<i>My Evo III can turn!</i>

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.410
<i>I'm being hunted down... like helpless prey.</i>

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.520
The Evo III sure is fast!

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.390
It even challenges the Eight-Six at the corners.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.060
A better car or better skill?

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.750
It's both! Sudo's cornering is unreal!

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.200
You know how Kyoichi Sudo races, right?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.540
What's his style?

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.270
He never makes mistakes.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.440
He sticks with the basics
and avoids flashy moves.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.450
In a race, he patiently tests
his opponent's weaknesses.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.220
He will choose the most rational way to win.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.420
He won't self-destruct, then.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.920
He's different from Seiji.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.090
Rationality is Kyoichi's bible.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.970
That's why he's only interested in 4WD cars.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.270
Against an equally skilled opponent,
he'll make sure his car

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.600
is better-equipped to win the race.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.870
He's like that.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.380
You sound rather bitter.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.010
I dislike him.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.740
I certainly don't want to lose to him.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.250
<i>That firing sound is so noisy!</i>

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.260
<i>I can't stand it!</i>

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.680
<i>His adaptability is exceptional.</i>

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.950
<i>He has no prior experience on this course.</i>

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.590
<i>But he can still race at this pace.</i>

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.620
<i>What an unbelievable "downhill" sense.</i>

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.630
<i>But no more playing around.</i>

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.930
<i>I'll end this shortly.</i>

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:04.530
Thank you very much!

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.210
Mogi?

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.320
Takumi's girlfriend?

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.220
I got you something.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.020
Thank you so much!

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.920
I'm happy.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.360
Where is Takumi?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.360
His shift ended at 5:00 today.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.560
You haven't seen him?

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.570
No.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.570
I thought you were with him.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.240
There it is, my favorite cheesecake!

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.410
Bon appétit!

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.070
If Takumi isn't on a date, where did he go?

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.450
You said he took the Eight-Six, right?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.350
Yeah.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.460
He may have taken the Emperors' bait

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.460
and gone to Akagi.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.120
No way!

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.870
<i>Takumi went to Akagi?</i>

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.230
<i>We're entering the flatter,</i>
<i>mid-speed section here.</i>

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.890
<i>Without a slope, he's as slow as a turtle.</i>

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.880
<i>The next "S" turn will do.</i>

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.950
<i>He can't avoid my counterattack.</i>

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.220
There!

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.830
<i>No way!</i>

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.540
<i>This is a short, full-blast section.</i>

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.630
<i>What acceleration!</i>

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.750
<i>He's charging in from the outside.</i>

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:28.180
<i>Challenging the Eight-Six at a corner?!</i>

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.320
<i>He'll take the inside</i>
<i>position at the next corner.</i>

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.270
<i>And with that amazing acceleration...</i>

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.700
<i>...the Eight-Six is going down!</i>

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.550
What?! The Evo III took the lead?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.020
At a corner?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.850
Yeah...

00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:08.020
Yeah.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.510
Yeah. I see.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.700
Big brother?

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.030
It's just like Kyoichi.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.040
He chose not to attack
at the steep-slope section.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.970
He waited until the Eight-Six
lost speed on the flatter section.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.140
With his technique and the Evo III's abilities,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.310
Kyoichi could've taken the lead earlier.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.980
But he waited until he had
a surefire chance to pass.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.420
That's the Kyoichi I know.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.860
Will the Eight-Six have a
chance to regain the lead?

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.530
Don't ask me that.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.190
I know you can figure out the answer yourself.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.350
Idiot!

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:10.520
He should've stayed home and let us handle it!

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.610
He didn't have to suffer this pointless loss!

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.060
<i>He's following me...</i>

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.700
<i>...at the same distance.</i>

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.000
<i>Amazing! He picked up more</i>
<i>speed after losing the lead.</i>

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.170
Usually, the corner exit
is the key for a turbo car

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.510
while it's the corner entrance for an NA.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.110
To put it simply, that's the
theory of downhill racing.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.350
But with the misfiring system...

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.190
Right. The misfiring system makes

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:26.030
both the Turbo's torque and
the NA's response possible.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.360
With Kyoichi's abilities,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.370
that Evo III becomes a
monstrous cornering machine.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.370
It can superbly enter and exit a corner.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.860
It's perfect for a dogfight.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.870
Like I said, this race was suicide!

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:45.080
From the get-go, this race
was never about speed.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.670
What?

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.390
Think about it.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.560
Kyoichi has carefully studied this course,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.060
while Takumi Fujiwara has no experience here.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.060
There's no question who the favorite is.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.690
Right.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.770
I don't know what went on between them,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.440
but Fujiwara showed up

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.070
without the tools to win this race.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.540
But why did he have to be so irrational?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.710
Only he understands that.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.720
Sometimes we want to race

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.780
to blow off some frustration within us.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.780
He had that air about him.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.900
This isn't his normal racing style.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.730
The Eight-Six's high-pitched
exhaust sounds like...

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.470
...an enraged roar.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.050
<i>Takumi gave up the lead.</i>

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.920
<i>Can he ever regain the lead, and...?</i>

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.490
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.990
<i>"Goodbye Eight-Six."</i>

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.650
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
