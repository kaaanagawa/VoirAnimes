"Act 6: Goodbye Eight-Six"

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.610
So, you think Takumi went to Akagi, huh?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.110
Hi, boss.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.880
We're not sure, but it's possible.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.650
He was acting weird all day today.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.650
Didn't someone from our team go to Akagi?

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.020
We can make some calls.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.690
No. If he went there to battle
it out with the Evo III...

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.720
...it's too late.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.540
I thought he was on a
hot date with you, Mogi!

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.830
What were you doing?!

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.570
I'm sorry.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.240
No need to apologize.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.910
It's not your fault.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.580
Besides, we don't know for sure yet

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.950
if he's actually racing in Akagi.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.450
Takumi...

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.040
<i>I haven't lost yet.</i>

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.240
He passed the Eight-Six!

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.080
This race is over.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.250
No worries now.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.590
Kyoichi is too careful to give up the lead.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.860
Kyoichi took the lead.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.000
<i>You can't relax yet.</i>

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.500
<i>The Eight-Six will get stickier.</i>

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.530
<i>This race is far from over, Kyoichi.</i>

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.510
Hey, I see them!

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.170
--The Evo III!
--The Emperor!

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.690
--What about the Eight-Six?
--There!

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.880
<i>He picked up the pace again.</i>

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.060
<i>I get it.</i>

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.870
<i>Since he doesn't know this course,</i>

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.330
<i>he couldn't attack it at</i>
<i>full speed when leading.</i>

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.840
<i>But while trailing,</i>

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.370
<i>he can predict what's ahead</i>
<i>based on my movements.</i>

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.930
<i>With that piece of junk... I'm amazed.</i>

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.500
<i>Considering our acceleration gap,</i>

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.800
<i>he must be turning corners</i>
<i>much faster than I am.</i>

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.590
<i>Unbelievable. His control is miraculous.</i>

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.730
<i>Should I speed up now,</i>
<i>knowing it'll strain the tires?</i>

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.070
<i>Or should I wait until the next</i>
<i>straightaway to speed up?</i>

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.420
<i>Silly me! I already know the answer.</i>

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.390
<i>I won't change the pace.</i>

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.990
<i>It would be the height of folly for me to do that.</i>

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.450
<i>Perhaps that's how Seiji lost.</i>

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.540
<i>A top-notch racer controls tire strain.</i>

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.630
<i>I'll stick to the basics... to win this!</i>

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.580
The gap isn't widening.
It's actually shortening.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.890
What?

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.660
The Eight-Six is going faster
than he would in Akina.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.190
That makes sense.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.200
What do you mean, big brother?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.030
The mid-section consists of a series
of mid-speed S-shaped corners.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.200
In this section, they can only accelerate

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.540
for a fraction of a second
from one corner to the next.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.380
Yeah.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.550
The rest of the time is spent

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.450
struggling with the constant side G-force.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.560
With the misfiring system, Kyoichi's Evo III

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.990
has unbeatable acceleration
coming out of corners.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.160
So, the Eight-Six has to compensate

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.300
by entering corners at a higher speed.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.070
Utilizing its lightweight body,
which is his only advantage,

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.670
he brakes at the last possible
moment before each corner

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.010
and uses the grip of all four tires

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.480
to achieve maximum cornering speed.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.920
If the Eight-Six weren't like a part of his body

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.590
due to all his hours of practice,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.590
he couldn't possibly achieve a
miraculous performance like this.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.650
He hasn't given up yet, then.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:58.110
He may be unable to grasp the
concept of giving up right now.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.780
He is becoming one with the machine.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.440
That's all.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.070
<i>Even if I shorten the gap at a corner,</i>

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.700
<i>he easily widens it on the straightaways!</i>

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.900
<i>That's the power differential.</i>

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.860
This is Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.690
Yuichi, it's only you.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.190
No, Takumi's not back yet.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.940
What's going on tonight?

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.110
Everyone seems to be looking for him.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.380
What? To Akagi?

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.970
I see.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.820
<i>I applaud you... for making it this far.</i>

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.790
<i>This is a real feat.</i>

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.950
Later.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.670
<i>This is the moment.</i>

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.480
<i>The end of the S-turn section.</i>

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.310
<i>I can go full speed after the next corner.</i>

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.720
<i>My serious racing starts now.</i>

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.650
<i>It'll end fast.</i>

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.660
<i>His style has changed.</i>

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.530
<i>For the first time tonight,</i>

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.770
<i>I'll use this feint followed</i>
<i>by an aggressive drift</i>

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.600
<i>to declare my intention of winning this race!</i>

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.550
<i>It's not a long straightaway by any means,</i>

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.950
<i>but it's long enough to shake him off.</i>

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.540
<i>He's fast! I can't keep up!</i>

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.240
<i>Maybe this is it.</i>

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.590
<i>Can I catch up?</i>

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.590
<i>Or not?</i>

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.460
In the racing world,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.090
a blown engine means defeat.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.760
But like I said earlier,

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.860
I didn't consider this a race.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.570
Now you can accept the reality.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.400
Your car is dead.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:07.180
The engine is completely toasted.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.410
Why don't you put your
Eight-Six to rest for good?

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.420
No matter how fast you can turn corners,

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.090
the difference between a fast
car and a slow car is too big.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.330
We'll race again when you have a machine

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.770
capable of competing with me.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.060
Is something wrong?

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.860
I did what I planned to do.

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.400
It was just for fun.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.770
For fun?

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.070
It seemed too close for just fun.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.740
Well, it wasn't even really fun.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.140
The Eight-Six's engine blew up
before all the fun could start.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.320
He blew his engine?! That idiot!

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.380
I think the Eight-Six lost.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.890
Seriously?

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.590
The Red Suns are in shock.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.590
He blew his engine.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.590
The Evo III was too much for him.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.600
Too much difference in power.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.600
He was undefeated until now.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.670
I'm shocked.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.670
I knew he would win!

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.330
Challenging him with an Eight-Six
was suicide to begin with.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.910
<i>It's what was expected, but...</i>

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:47.580
<i>...I don't get it. I'm not satisfied.</i>

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.420
<i>Was I expecting something else...</i>

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.790
<i>...from that Eight-Six?</i>

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.360
We'll save our race until the weekend.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.960
I'm looking forward to it.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.170
Enjoy your confidence while it lasts.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.840
Because I'll destroy you, Ryosuke Takahashi,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.400
and we, the Emperors, will conquer Gunma!

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.030
<i>My precious...</i>

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.990
<i>My precious Eight-Six...</i>

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.620
What?

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.830
Hey.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.800
Dad!

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.550
Dad, I...

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.080
We'll talk later. First things first.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.690
We'll tow the car.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:17.960
What are you doing?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.070
Stop staring and get in.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.970
Yeah.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.220
How did you find out?

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.590
About what happened, I mean.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.430
I had a feeling.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.330
--A feeling?
--Yeah.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.040
--Hey, Dad?
--What?

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.140
I've been saving up,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.480
and have about two million yen now.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.480
Maybe it's not enough,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.520
but I'll use that money to repair the engine.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.690
You've got more than that.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.360
You're richer than you think.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.390
You've been delivering tofu since junior high.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.830
I have a savings account in your name.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.530
I sometimes borrow from it, though.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.710
Then use that money, too!

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.510
I can't.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.180
Is it that expensive?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.920
How much will it cost?

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.150
It's not a monetary problem.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.250
The engine can't be repaired.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:52.490
The pin that connected the crankshaft
and the con-rod snapped,

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.160
and the loose con-rod punched
a huge hole in the block

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.570
from the inside.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.170
<i>It's my fault.</i>

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.840
<i>If I hadn't acted so irrationally...</i>

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.340
That engine is finished.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.640
We'll need to put in another one.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.480
Another one?

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.810
Yeah.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.320
Are you bringing in an
engine from another car?

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.020
Even if it could run again,
it would feel like a different car.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.360
Isn't that engine special?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.860
You put so much effort into building it,

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.900
so let's try to fix it.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.840
We'll borrow money if we have to.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.010
I'll donate all the money I make!

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.170
We aren't that poor.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.340
Then why use another car's engine?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.710
If I could...

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.350
If I could, I would fix it,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.990
but it's beyond repair.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.190
That engine is useless.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.390
That's that.

Takumi, you think...

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:35.520
...you're responsible for this, don't you?

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.970
You're wrong.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.460
You just happened to be the one driving it.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.770
