"Act 8: Dangerous Car"

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.370
His counterattack worked flawlessly!

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.600
It was so easy I'm at a loss.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.410
That Lan-Evo is monstrous.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.410
Its extra boost and traction...

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.410
No FR can imitate that,
no matter how powerful it is.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.750
You're so right.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.820
There's no denying the mechanical
superiority of a 4WD car.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.890
This just became a tough race for Ryosuke.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.730
Will he have an opportunity to regain the lead?

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.400
I doubt it.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.230

<i>I've realized that it's actually nothing</i>

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.030
<i>Now that I know that, I'm not afraid of Ryosuke.</i>

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.030
<i>Why? Because I'm superior</i>
<i>to him in that category.</i>

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.750
Hey, Takumi?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.420
What do you think happened in Akagi?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.510
Maybe it's over.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.260
Who do you think won?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.830
I have no idea.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.830
I can't tell, because I lost to that Lan-Evo

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.160
before I saw his full capabilities.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.830
I'm getting upset just talking to you about it.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.350
--Sorry.
--Don't be sorry.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.910
I mean, talking to you is helping me get it out.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.050
I was so depressed all day today.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.200
After the engine blew up,

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.800
the Lan-Evo's driver told me

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.400
that he didn't consider it a race.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.570
He said we would race for real

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.170
when I had a better car.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.370
He did?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.540
The way he said it,

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.350
it sounded like he was reasoning
with me like a schoolteacher

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.870
instead of bragging about his victory.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.590
My pride just won't let me forget what he said.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.200
Well...

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.830
...let's get started.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.410
By tomorrow night,
there will be a rumor in Akina

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.370
that the "Fujiwara Tofu"
car has been resurrected.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.960
<i>It's a finely tuned car, Kyoichi.</i>

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.130
<i>It has surprisingly fine cornering abilities,</i>

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.890
<i>and it can accelerate at any rpm.</i>

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.340
<i>It turns easily and exits corners swiftly.</i>

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.200
<i>Its acceleration is unbeatable.</i>

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.310
<i>What a scary car!</i>

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.080
<i>It's overwhelming to observe it up close.</i>

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.820
<i>But it's not like I just realized this.</i>

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.690
<i>I found it out yesterday.</i>

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.840
Wow! Ryosuke bumped the guardrail!

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.110
He had to do that to keep up with that Evo III.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.240
Look at this time.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.610
Amazing! If the Evo III keeps this up,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.450
he'll surpass the course record.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.450
Ryosuke isn't slow.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.960
That Evo III is going really fast.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.890
Hello, this is corner #35.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.660
The Evo III is still ahead.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.900
Got it.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.900
Keisuke, will he be okay?

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.540
The Lan-Evo's maintaining his pace.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.870
He may just run away with the victory.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.710
Don't worry.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.640
My brother will overcome this predicament.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.410
Sudo sure is fast.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.220
Most of us here probably didn't
expect him to be this fast.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.660
I certainly didn't. But my brother did.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.660
Using the data collected
at various checkpoints

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.660
during last night's race against the Eight-Six,

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.670
he was able to calculate Sudo's abilities

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.670
more precisely than I ever could.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.510
So I believe...

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.740
...that my brother will win in the end.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.620
<i>The misfiring system and</i>
<i>the 4WD are a killer combo.</i>

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.190
<i>Full acceleration in low gears won't cut it.</i>

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.150
<i>But I may get a chance at a high-speed corner.</i>

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.190
<i>I knew it!</i>

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.470
<i>He isn't attacking from another angle.</i>

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.410
<i>Why not?</i>

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.040
<i>His passiveness is eerie.</i>

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.410
<i>Has he given up?</i>

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.720
<i>No, I know very well that he isn't like that.</i>

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.710
<i>He will attack.</i>

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.400
<i>I know I'm in the superior position,</i>

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.260
<i>but I feel like he's hunting me down.</i>

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.900
<i>Have I not yet overcome</i>
<i>my complex about Ryosuke?</i>

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.170
<i>A victory over him will erase that.</i>

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.180
<i>I'm ready for you, Ryosuke.</i>

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.110
<i>All my tires still have full traction.</i>

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.850
<i>What a thrilling race this is!</i>

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.390
<i>I only have one chance.</i>

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.320
<i>I need to attack precisely...</i>

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.690
<i>...into the flickering loophole.</i>

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.230
Ryosuke is right on him.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.900
But the Evo III is going fast.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.340
He isn't slowing his pace at all!

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.470
It doesn't look good for Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.480
The finish line is right after this corner.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.310
His defeat has become more certain now.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.480
There!

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.850
The Evo III is still ahead!

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.680
<i>This right turn is my chance!</i>

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.330
<i>Kyoichi, your weakness lies</i>

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.440
<i>in your unconquered fear of turning right.</i>

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.170
<i>Frankly...</i>

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.380
<i>...you stink at turning right!</i>

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.510
<i>What?!</i>

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.950
--The FC took the outside!
--Amazing!

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.890
The Evo III is completely blocked by the FC!

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.460
<i>Darn! I can't utilize the 4WD's traction</i>

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.300
<i>or the misfiring system in this situation!</i>

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.210
Incredible! The FC is cornering
while blocking the Evo III!

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.740
Go, Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.410
Go! Go! Go!

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.990
--Go, Ryosuke!
--He's going!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.700
--He's ahead!
--They switched!

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.410
That's it, Ryosuke!

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.510
Keep it up! Keep going!

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.060
He did it!

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.030
A course record! A super win!

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.860
Eat our dust!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.960
The Red Suns save Gunma!

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.940
--Yeah!
--He did it!

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.790
I can't believe Kyoichi couldn't beat him.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.790
An amazing course record.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.560
I've never seen Ryosuke go that fast.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.490
Why is he faster in battles than usual?

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.000
My brother usually leaves
enough of a safety margin

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.170
to avoid crashing during our time trials.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.670
When he's forced to raise the bar,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.840
a record like this is the natural result.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.110
That Evo III was a tough opponent.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.510
So he got a bit serious.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.540
Wow!

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.390
What a win!

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.050
That corner was amazing!

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.730
I want to ask you something, Ryosuke.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.730
What's the difference between us?

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:48.570
Why can't I beat you?

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.570
I just don't get it.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:53.040
Please tell me.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.880
In my opinion, your technique
is almost as good as mine.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.250
No need for consolation. Just tell me why!

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.590
I'm saying that it's not
because of your technique.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.320
Your weakness is your right turn.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.590
Not all right turns...

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.930
...but at certain right turns,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.600
your weakness surfaces.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.100
Right turns?

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.600
To the right of the center line is a "dead zone"

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.110
occupied by opposing traffic.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.610
You can't attack a right-hand corner

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.280
without worrying about a head-on collision.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.110
No one can give it 100%.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.620
But with experience and effort,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.710
you can come close to 100%.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.720
Do you understand, Kyoichi?
That's the difference.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.030
In motorsports, you don't have
to worry about opposing traffic.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.300
The Gymkhana circuit
doesn't have two-way traffic.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:56.270
And your home course,
Nikko Irohazaka, is one-way,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.400
so there's no opposing traffic.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.910
In your counterattack,

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.710
you always stay outside at right-hand corners.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.850
I read that as meaning
you're afraid of the inside.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.050
In the race against the Eight-Six,
you showed me too much,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.580
which is why you lost.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.200
<i>You beat me, Ryosuke.</i>

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.040
<i>My belief that I had caught up</i>
<i>with you was an illusion.</i>

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.380
<i>You have street "charisma."</i>

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.120
It was amazing!

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.590
I realized again how great
Ryosuke Takahashi really is.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:50.620
Anyway, the Lan-Evo squad
"storm" that threatened Gunma

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.930
has blown itself out,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.130
and peace has been restored.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.130
Yeah. I should've gone to watch the race.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:02.070
By the way, were Takumi and Itsuki with you?

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.410
I didn't see them there.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.870
Maybe Takumi didn't feel like it

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.380
after his loss the other night.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.050
I'm sure he didn't.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.080
Even we are still in shock.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.550
He specifically told me
he wouldn't go to Akagi.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.990
I wonder what changed his mind.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.660
I'm so happy that Ryosuke Takahashi won!

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.900
Now it's official that
Gunma's standard is very high.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.400
I'll see you in class!

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.250
Hey! You won't believe this,
Takumi. The other day...

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.120
Wait, Takumi!

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.920
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking to you.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.030 line:50 %
"A few days later"

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.340
What? My dad's Eight-Six?

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.840
It must be a mistake.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.550
I don't know anything about it.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.220
One of our team members says
he saw it in Akina one night.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.990
It was a three-door "panda" Trueno.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.860
I don't think it was ours.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.690
Where is your dad's car, anyway?

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.360
I don't really know.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.530
We towed it from Akagi,

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.830
and my dad took it somewhere after that.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.540
What about your morning deliveries?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.110
I'm using a pickup truck my dad brought in.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.880
Don't tell me that your legendary Eight-Six

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.380
is at a scrap yard right now.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.120
I'll cry!

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.620
I doubt it.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.620
My dad said he would put in another engine.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.860
Seriously? What kind of engine?

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.700
I doubt it'll be another normal 4AG engine.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.800
Maybe it'll be a turbo!

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.070
I have no interest in that, really.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.410
Why is that?

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.240
I think that, of all parts,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.810
the engine is the most
important element of a car.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.680
--I guess so.
--It's like the brain in a human body.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.990
Hey, Takumi...

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.490
People usually compare it to the human heart.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.990
Is that right?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.490
It's the heart, then.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.500
I'd just hate to have another engine in it.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.370
It would feel like a different car.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.540
I guess I can see that.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.870
You're attached to it.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.910
I can understand how you feel...

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.910
...but we can't help wondering

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.970
what kind of engine it'll have.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.040
How does it feel, Bunta?

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.370
It's getting better,

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.240
but since the engine is so good,
the suspension can't catch up.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.050
The engine is that good, huh?

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.380
Yeah, I love it.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.720
It sounds very tempting.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.810
I may want to ride with you next time.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:47.690
This car is very scary.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.860
That's not for you to say, Bunta.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.570
I already know how scary your driving can be.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.740
Let me give you a glimpse.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.330
What?

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.180
Hey, Bunta!

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.680
How did that happen?!

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.350
You know, I needed to use this

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.690
as a wall to hold up my whole body.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.390
I used to think the side G-force in pass racing

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.230
wasn't worthy of a bucket seat.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:24.470
But I think my bones will bruise
if we don't put one in now.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.130
I've had enough for today.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.340
This is one tough customer.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.240
But that makes it more exciting.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.740
I still haven't decided
how I'm going to set it up.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:40.250
I'll take my time and enjoy it.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:45.550
I need to consider that inept Takumi
is going to be driving it, too.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.050
Inept, he says.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.080
Takumi? Is he kidding?

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.730
It's kind of boring being in high school.

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.070
You think so?

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.570
I can't wait to start working.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:05.640
Until you have a real job, you're still a child.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.010
I wanna work and make money.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:14.010
With a good job, I can have my own car.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.020
I can't buy anything now. How pathetic!

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.850
Don't be so impatient.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.530
Whether we like it or not,
we're graduating next spring.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.630
I can't wait...

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.460
...because there's nothing
worthwhile at school.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.800
You seem down, Takumi.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:55.020
Wait!

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.590
Why have you been avoiding me?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.390
Did I do something wrong,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:02.660
or say something hurtful?

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.870
If so, please tell me. I'll apologize!

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.440
Not really.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.270
--Then what's wrong?
--Nothing's wrong.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.170
Something is clearly wrong!

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.240
We were okay until recently.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.450
Now you seem distant. It's not fair.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:22.750
What's wrong, Takumi?

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.420
I don't know why you're so worked up

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.790
about someone like me.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.960
It doesn't matter.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.790
It's not like we're dating.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.930
That doesn't make any sense.
What's going on?

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.800
Don't follow me.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.570
Good luck with the Mercedes guy.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.270
Leave me alone.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.280
<i>What...?</i>

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.110
