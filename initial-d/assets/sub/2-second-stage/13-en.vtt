00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.110

"Act 13: Changing Seasons"

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
It's rare for a race to last this long.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.300
It's a battle of endurance.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.040
It's physically and mentally demanding

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
to maintain extreme intensity

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.550
while dealing with the
continuous lateral G-force.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.880
Especially when the course is this tricky.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.820
Others would've given up already.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.690
Stamina will be a major factor.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390
All we know is...

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.060
...that whoever loses focus first will lose.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.340
<i>I may never see her again.</i>

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.900
<i>So what am I supposed to do?</i>

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.390
<i>I should at least tell her the truth...</i>

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.020
<i>Not that it'll change anything.</i>

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.860
<i>I should tell her that I love her.</i>

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.230
What?

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.600
Um, I, uh...

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.410
It's the third round!

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.320
Both of them are so intense.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.990
They're getting me fired up.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.360
The Levin looks different from the first round.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.920
He's good.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.110
<i>What is this?!</i>

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.110
<i>His style has changed.</i>

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.670
<i>He's so fast that I can't relax at all.</i>

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.950
<i>I was being cautious at first.</i>

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.690
<i>The theory for passes says not to go 100%</i>

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.190
<i>before determining the road conditions.</i>

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.030
<i>But this round is a different story!</i>

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.540
<i>I don't want to lose now.</i>

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.140
<i>I'll chase him to the end!</i>

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.470
<i>My Eight-Six is finally listening to me.</i>

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.180
<i>I've never wanted to win a race this badly.</i>

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.910
<i>Is it because he drives an Eight-Six?</i>

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.150
<i>I just want to win with my new Eight-Six!</i>

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.600
<i>No!</i>

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.250
<i>That was close.</i>

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.450
<i>I need to keep my focus,</i>

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.190
<i>or I'll lose more than just this race.</i>

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.530
<i>I wonder if I'm getting tired.</i>

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.730
<i>I've started to wobble a little.</i>

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.070
<i>Could it be the tires? Not now!</i>

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.720
<i>The rear traction is slipping.</i>

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.980
<i>The rear tires are losing their grip.</i>

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.890
<i>This isn't good.</i>

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.230
<i>I can't adjust the tires.</i>

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.660
<i>I've come this far...</i>

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.930
<i>...but maybe this is it.</i>

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.030
<i>I may lose!</i>

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.750
<i>I know I'm losing speed.</i>

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.450
<i>So why isn't he pulling away from me?</i>

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.350
<i>Could it be...? It's the only explanation!</i>

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.010
<i>He's having the same problem.</i>

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.910
<i>His tires are losing their grip, too!</i>

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.850
Takumi!

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.400
This is the fourth round.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.860
It's become a crazy endurance race.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.580
<i>Your rear tires must be slipping, too.</i>

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.710
<i>The power increase puts</i>
<i>more stress on the tires.</i>

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.120
<i>Our powerful cars have been running</i>

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.820
<i>at the same pace all this time.</i>

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.620
<i>It's only logical that we'd</i>
<i>have the same tire problem.</i>

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.570
<i>He's good!</i>

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.670
<i>It's obvious from behind.</i>

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.840
<i>The worse the conditions get,</i>

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.970
<i>the better he seems to get.</i>

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.480
<i>But he's only human.</i>

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.980
<i>He's not invincible!</i>

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.350
<i>This is a test of endurance!</i>

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.810
<i>Actually, these slippery tires</i>

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.800
<i>make it easier for me to see</i>
<i>my car's ultimate capabilities.</i>

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.490
<i>It feels natural.</i>

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.460
<i>It's running the way I want it to.</i>

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.630
<i>I'm all fired up!</i>

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.960
<i>This is my new Eight-Six!</i>

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.800
<i>Basically, I step on the accelerator to swing.</i>

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.060
<i>It's the same as before.</i>

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.370
<i>But I can clearly see a major difference</i>

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.900
<i>when drifting at full speed.</i>

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.470
<i>Dad, I know how to control this car now!</i>

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.990
<i>Uh... what round is this?</i>

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.400
<i>I've started to space out a little.</i>

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.230
<i>I'm getting tired,</i>

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.070
<i>but I'm sure he is, too.</i>

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.670
<i>At this stage of the race,</i>

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.510
<i>it's mentally more exhausting to follow</i>

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.180
<i>than it is to lead.</i>

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.510
<i>A little difference in speed won't</i>
<i>be enough to take the lead.</i>

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.020
<i>You can only lose by falling behind.</i>

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.690
<i>So, you can't lose when you're leading.</i>

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.360
<i>The next corner is that mudslide.</i>

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.030
<i>He won't have enough space to sneak by.</i>

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.800
<i>I should be safe.</i>

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.870
<i>I'll keep this up for as long as it takes</i>

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.600
<i>until you lose focus and make an error.</i>

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.370
What?!

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.700
There's less mud on the road!

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.020
Don't be reckless!

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.710
It's impossible to pass me here!

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.810
<i>He's crazy!</i>

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.210
<i>I won.</i>

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.420
<i>Darn! I didn't notice that</i>
<i>the mud was pushed aside,</i>

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.860
<i>which created enough</i>
<i>space for him to get by me.</i>

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.190
<i>Regardless...</i>

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.160
<i>...he was able to gauge</i>
<i>that narrow space accurately.</i>

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.690
<i>He's way out of my league.</i>

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.540
They've slowed down.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.440
The race is over.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.380
Will it be the Trueno or the Levin?

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.390
The Trueno!

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.190
Takumi won!

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.530

--He did it!

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.620
--He pulled it off!
--All right!

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.590
They're finally back!

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.530
Big brother!

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.330
Takumi.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.370
Thanks for waiting.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:33.710
I got back safely, but I'm exhausted.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.770
Get in, Kazumi. We're leaving.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.010
<i>Kazumi!</i>

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.090
Well, goodbye, Itsuki.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.400
<i>I couldn't say goodbye...</i>

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:16.210
<i>...because I didn't want it to be goodbye.</i>

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.530
--Takumi?
--Yeah?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.360
How did the race go?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.560
Well.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.200
I managed to win.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.400
I see. You're amazing, really.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.010
It was a complete loss for me.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.790
Even though you brought me there

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.790
so that I could be with Kazumi...

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.960
...I just couldn't tell her how I felt.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.570
I've been thinking about her
constantly since yesterday.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.470
Falling in love with her
made me realize something.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.810
Loving someone is really a painful thing.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.160
Loving someone is serious business.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.930
When it doesn't work out,
your chest aches so much.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.570
Laugh at me if you want.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.270
Why would I laugh?

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:46.070
You know the feeling?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.870

You only have an hour until your deliveries.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.220
I know.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.050
Wake me up when it's time.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.720
Sure.

I never knew that our car was that good.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.530
Hey, Dad?

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.600
Maybe you can teach me
about engines and stuff

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.540
when you have time.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.380
What happened all of a sudden?

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.440
I realized which essential
element I was lacking.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.740
Takumi, Itsuki is acting weird.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.540
You'll find out eventually
anyway, so I'll tell you.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.550
I see. That's really unfortunate.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.720
I thought they'd make it.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.490

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.360
Itsuki?

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.920
What?!

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:58.910
Kazumi!

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.610
What?!

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.640
Didn't you go back to Saitama?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.650
It was all so sudden.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.480
I came back to get my stuff.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.120
Oh, yeah?

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.120
But that's not all I left here.

We left in a hurry,

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.820
so I couldn't say goodbye to you properly.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.530
Kazumi?

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.170
Are you free now? Just for an hour?

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.660
I have some time.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.070
He had to leave early...

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.240
...for personal reasons.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.910

Bittersweet youth...

She's the most important
thing to him right now.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.690
That reminds me.

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.720
Takumi, I heard that your girlfriend

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.530
--started a part-time job.
--What?

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.550
How are things with you two?

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.400
<i>Mogi got a job...?</i>

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.450
Autumn is almost over.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.480
I'll never forget this autumn in Akina.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.890
I'll think of it every time
the leaves change colors.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.030
I'll never forget the people I met in Gunma...

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:29.330
...especially this outspoken
but compassionate boy

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:34.470
who encouraged me to live.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.840
He's a year younger than I am,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.910
and is like the little brother I never had.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.140
I won't forget him.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:08.370
Thank you very much!

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.370
Welcome! For here or to go?

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.910 line:50 %
"Shibusawa Station"

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.350 line:50 %
<i>There was always that</i>

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.350 line:50 %
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:26.020 line:50 %
<i>It was there on days when</i>

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:26.020 line:50 %
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:34.800 line:50 %
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:43.400 line:50 %
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:50.470 line:50 %
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.370
<i>Goodbye, Kazumi.</i>

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.410
<i>I couldn't tell you this...</i>

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:59.720 line:50 %
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.650
<i>...but I loved you.</i>

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:07.330 line:50 %
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:15.340 line:50 %
<i>It blows through with a radiant light</i>

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:24.070 line:50 %
<i>Just like it did that day</i>

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.530
Big brother... have you formed
the All Gunma Team yet?

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:47.430 line:50 %
<i>The grave sin of betrayal</i>

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.930
I've picked the candidates.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.570 line:50 %
<i>The strength of believing in each other</i>

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.770
Now it's up to them to join the team.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:57.410 line:50 %
<i>The countless days and nights</i>

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.780
<i>I can't keep losing like this!</i>

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:06.380 line:50 %
<i>Let's tuck them away in our hearts</i>

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.080
<i>I'll get my revenge on the Emperors...</i>

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.420
<i>...and Akina's Eight-Six!</i>

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:21.340
<i>On the road of meetings and partings</i>

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:31.330
<i>We keep on walking while our hearts get hurt</i>

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:41.590
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:51.590
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:59.970
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>
