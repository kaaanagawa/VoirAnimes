"An amazing downhill specialist

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.060 line:50 %
came out of Akina's mountain passes.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.060 line:50 %
Driving his cherished Eight-Six,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.060 line:50 %
this young genius stunned all

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.630 line:50 %
with his amazing drift technique.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.860 line:50 %
Since the beginning of junior high school,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.130 line:50 %
Takumi has been driving

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.130 line:50 %
through the mountain passes

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.030 line:50 %
making deliveries for his family's tofu store.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.440 line:50 %
It was all part of his father Bunta's plan

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440 line:50 %
to nurture Takumi's talent

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440 line:50 %
and make him a racing genius.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.070 line:50 %
Driving every day, through rain and snow,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.440 line:50 %
he gradually acquired and

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.440 line:50 %
perfected his remarkable skills.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440 line:50 %
He emerged as a hero and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440 line:50 %
the fastest man in Gunma,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.880 line:50 %
and all the racers in the area

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.880 line:50 %
started to challenge him.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.080 line:50 %
Takumi improved with every race...

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.420 line:50 %
His driving amazed the spectators

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.420 line:50 %
and captured their hearts.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.650 line:50 %
In the end, he even defeated

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.650 line:50 %
the great Ryosuke Takahashi,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.650 line:50 %

There were more battles ahead

for this fastest downhill racer."

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.040
Darn it! There's no way I'll let
an outsider mess with me!

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.860
This is a piece of cake.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.760
Whoa!

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.510
--He passed him!
--Oh, no! That Evo IV is fast!

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.010
Darn it!

"Act 1: A New Threat"

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.980
It's just like what fighter pilots used to do

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.750
when they shot down other fighters.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.080
Quite fancy, isn't it?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.060
In a month, we, Team Emperor, will rule Gunma.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.550
Lan-Evo drivers are the true
kings of the mountain passes.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.020
--Hey, Takumi.
--Yeah?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.690
As I get used to it, I really think

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.120
that my Eight-Five is
pathetically slow on the uphill.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.760
I want more power.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.060
Really?

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.730
I've secretly been thinking of adding
a turbocharger to my Eight-Five

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.200
and turning it into a super-fast car!

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.400
Turbo? Can you add that now?

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.840
Isn't it supposed to come
with the car when you buy it?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.880
I know. But there's this thing
called a "bolt-on turbo."

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.550
You can add it later if you want to.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.180
Turbo is the easiest way to add
power to your car, isn't it?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.320
Imagine my Eight-Five with a turbocharger...

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.590
...going as fast as drivers
in an S13 or One-Eighty...

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.090
...on a straight course!

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.560
I bet everyone would be stunned!

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.220
Just thinking about it is exciting! Hooray!

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.610
Move over, Itsuki. Someone's
coming up really fast.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.670
What...?

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.840
Hey! The other way!

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.250
--That's a Lan-Evo!
--A Lan-Evo?

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.690
<i>What's up with that car?</i>
<i>What a strange movement!</i>

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.230
Did you see that insane acceleration?!

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.670
--Yeah.
--The engine is only 2000 cc...

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.470
...but it's got 280 horsepower.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.560
That's the power of turbo.
It's also got four-wheel drive.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.410
<i>I see. That movement comes</i>
<i>from the four-wheel drive.</i>

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.510
<i>Four tires can handle power that two tires can't.</i>

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.930
My Evo IV is so beautiful
that it gives me chills.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.530
This is an example

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.100
of what the pursuit of perfect
driving functionality leads to.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.440
It's like the body of a well-trained boxer.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.510
The air ducts on the front...

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.840
Protruding blister packing...

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.410
The oversized rear wing...

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.210
They all have their purpose.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.180
The Lan-Evo was developed and perfected

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.990
to win world-class rally tournaments.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.660
High-powered turbo and four-wheel drive.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.360
A car isn't complete without them.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.130
The Lan-Evo is the fastest street racer.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:21.500
Hey, Kyoichi. Let's finish
all the FR punks in Gunma.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.410
That Lan-Evo is here.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.050
I don't like this.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.820
Do you think they're from some racing team?

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.390
Don't worry about them.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.190
I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.820
Oh, me, too! Please!

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.890
He's coming this way!

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.860
Hey!

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.440
I need directions.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.710
Uh, okay!

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.550
This route is much shorter.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.190
I see. Thanks a lot.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.060
By the way, let me ask you something.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.290
Who's the fastest driver here in Akina?

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.630
The fastest?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.530
Did you by any chance come here
to challenge the Eight-Six?

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.630
What, us? Challenging an Eight-Six?

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.180
Your face is enough of a joke, Levin boy.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:39.180
Defeating an Eight-Six
will not impress anyone.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.410
Worse than that.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.910
My teammates would laugh at me
if I bragged about such a thing.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.220
Anyone driving a junker like
an Eight-Six is beneath me!

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.490
I wouldn't race them even if they asked.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.500
You shouldn't talk like that...

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.170
...when you've never even
seen Akina's Eight-Six!

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.970
Akina's Eight-Six has never lost!

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.970
Not to an FC! Not to an FD...

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.840
...not even to an R32!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.650
Oh, really? They all must have
been really bad drivers, then.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.020
Not at all! They were all the
top drivers in this prefecture!

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.950
Oh, no!

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.120
The top? It's pretty low-level
here in Gunma, isn't it?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.490
What did you just say?!

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.960
Stop it, Itsuki!

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.530
You, too, Seiji.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.900
You don't have to talk like that.
We didn't come here to pick fights.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.900
Sorry, guys. My buddy here has a big mouth.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.140
No problem.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.070
I'll just say this so you won't misunderstand.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.070
We don't mean to insult that Eight-Six driver.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.640
I am sure his technique is great.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.410
But the car...

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.080
I'd have to say the Eight-Six
is no longer good enough.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.980
He's right! Tell that to the driver.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.690
And tell him that we might let him race us

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.220
if he drives a more powerful car.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.060
But we will never lose.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.760
The king of mountain passes is the Lan-Evo!

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.170
Darn! Hey, Takumi!

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.180
Aren't you mad at all after all that talk?!

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.780
Yeah, I was pretty angry.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.550
So why didn't you say anything?!

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.020
Watching you get furious...

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.420
...somehow calmed me down.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.760
What the heck is up with that?

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.790
Besides, there have been guys
who talked like that before, right?

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:37.470
--Right...
--Arguing with them doesn't do any good.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.900
You can't really tell who's faster
unless you actually race.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.400
I see your point.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.480
But I can't just stand there when
someone insults the Eight-Six like that!

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.910
Because I've always admired the Eight-Six.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.610
I know the Eight-Six is an old model.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.050
It's got no turbo, and it's slow on the uphill.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.150
But in the true fan's mind,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.560
the Eight-Six is faster than any other car!

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.030
Hey, stop crying. Here you go.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.530
What?

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.900
Drink your coffee.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.560
Thanks.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.010
Hey, Takumi. You can do it, right?

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.210
You can beat the Lan-Evo on a downhill,

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.680
and crush the ego of that
cocky long-haired guy!

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.340
I don't know. He said he
wouldn't race the Eight-Six.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.620
--I've got it... The turbo!
--What?

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.520
If we added turbo to the Eight-Six,
it would be amazing, Takumi!

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.110
This Lan-Evo jerk certainly sounds obnoxious.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.910
Yeah. I was so furious!

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.050
I wonder if they're the guys who
came to challenge Thunder Fire?

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.990
They're members of a team
called Emperor or something.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.830
I heard they're from Nikko
and they only drive Lan-Evos,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.400
and that they're extremely cocky,
but they drive very fast.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.430
I heard they beat Thunder Fire into the ground.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.870
I heard about that, too.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.070
They supposedly said that
they wanted to rule Gunma,

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.070
so they might show up in Akina.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.440
Are you serious?!

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.910
I wonder if they were checking
out the area yesterday?

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.410
The Lan-Evo will be really hard to beat...

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.450
...even for Takumi's Eight-Six.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.050
Thank you very much!

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.460
Anyway, putting these guys aside,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.390
we never know when or who
he'll be racing from now on.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.030
So because of that,

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.430
we definitely need to beef up his Eight-Six.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.300
Right?! Right?!

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.640
That's what I'm talking about!

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.110
Adding turbo to the Eight-Six.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.470
That's a good idea!

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.910
I mean, good for Itsuki.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:08.680
It might be easier for him to just
switch to a faster car, of course.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.520
But I just can't imagine him driving
anything other than the Eight-Six.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.060
Yeah. We want him to stick to the Eight-Six.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.490
You're both so right!

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.600
The coolest part is that he drives
the Eight-Six and he's darn fast!

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.000
Takumi, give it some thought.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.400
I don't know...

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.040
It's my father's car, you know.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.210
That's right, I forgot...

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.010
Can't we somehow convince your father?

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.410
I've got it! If we told him
we'd pay for everything,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.120
I bet he wouldn't object!

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.790
You're right! I bet he'd love
having his car souped up!

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.290
How about it, Takumi?!

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.930
If the car were more powerful,
its fuel economy would suffer, right?

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.460
Yeah, sort of.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.060
Then we've got no chance.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.860
Because my dad is stingy as hell.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.140
Don't say things like that
to spoil our image of him!

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.170
Your dad is our idol, you know!

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:11.650
What?! That man is your idol?

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.010
Hey...

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.880
You shouldn't waste time
trying to convince him.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.050
We should just go ahead

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.690
with the "Akina Eight-Six
Power-Up Project" ourselves!

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.920
Right! Let's do it!

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.960
Long time no see, Ryosuke.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.420
Kyoichi Sudo. I thought it was you.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.470
What are you up to?

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.730
Easy, now! You should be nicer,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.670
seeing as how we haven't
seen each other in over a year.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.370
We're bored because we don't have
anyone to play with in our hood.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.080
So we came looking for some
high-spirited playmates, that's all.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.680
Since this will be our playground,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.520
we thought we'd say hi
to the people here today.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.520
How considerate of you. Do as you wish.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.090
But here in Akagi,

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.430
the playtime won't be as fun as you think...

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.530
...as long as our team, the Red Suns, is here.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.100
You're just as proud as I remember.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.440
But don't forget this...

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.370
I'm not the same person I was a year ago.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.050
You beat me last time, but now it's my turn!

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.850
Just as you broke my perfect winning record,

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.340
I will now break your winning streak!

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.390
I'm sorry to tell you, but my streak...

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.530
...was broken recently.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.230
What?

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.560
I lost to an Eight-Six on a
downhill course in Akina.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.900
What did you say?!

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900
I was considering retiring,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.840
but I don't want you to
think that I'm running away.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.640
So maybe I'll agree to a rematch
and race you once more.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.040
And I admire your enthusiasm
in coming all the way here.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.410
I'll speak to the other teams

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.410
and arrange for the course in Akagi

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.980
to be free for three days before the race.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.020
Drive as much as you want and get used to it.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.550
I'll race you whenever you're ready, Kyoichi.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.900
What a jerk, acting all cool like that!
I'll chase him down and tailgate him!

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.270
Don't, Seiji. You can't.
You won't be able to catch him.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.710
I won't? Such a skinny, frail guy!

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:56.510
He doesn't look that tough at all.
And that outdated FC...

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.180
He even lost to an Eight-Six, right?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.480
You idiot! Don't underestimate
Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:07.550
I was solidly defeated by his FC last year!

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.960
<i>The White Comet of Akagi...</i>

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.030
<i>I thought I was the only</i>
<i>one who could beat him...</i>

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:20.470
<i>But Ryosuke lost?</i>
<i>He lost to an Eight-Six from Akina?</i>

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.970
Akina's Eight-Six has never lost to anyone!

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.910
Not to an FC! Not to an FD...

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.340
...not even to an R32!

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:36.520
<i>I see. That kid was talking</i>
<i>about that same Eight-Six.</i>

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.820
<i>I wonder what the driver's like?</i>

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.370
Guess who?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.700
Cut it out, Mogi.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.940
I'm actually relieved.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:05.350
I don't know what I would have done
if you had said some other girl's name.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.140
Silly...

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.720
Hey, Takumi, let's go home.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.160
Oh, maybe I'll go home alone.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.830
After all, I am the lonely driver.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.630
Yeah. So, I should go home alone...

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:31.210
--The "Eight-Six Power-Up Project."
--What are you talking about?
We have to work today.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.910
I have something to do, too.

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.810
Okay.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.380
See you, Takumi. Bye!

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.910
Bye.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.150
So, Takumi...

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.820
...how far have you two gone since then?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:45.990
How far?

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:47.390
Oh, come on!

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.390
You and Natsuki! Have you
gone farther than kissing?

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:52.520
Come on, tell me! Whoops!

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:23.320
This is a one-race match.
It'll be decided by a hill climb.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.290
--Fine.
--Shall we begin, then?

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.030
Are you ready, Seiji?

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.160
Anytime!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
<i>Don't mess this up, Takeshi.</i>

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.870
<i>Show them the willpower of Gunma drivers!</i>

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.880
<i>Just for today, I'll root for you!</i>

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.680
<i>Our goal is much more than this race.</i>

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.880
<i>Seiji, don't waste time goofing around here.</i>

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.920
Five seconds to the start!

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.320
Four... Three...

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.420
Two... One...

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.150
Go!

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.570
<i>Wait and see.</i>

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:43.200
<i>Compared to a Lan-Evo, an R32 is just a toy.</i>

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.300
I'll show you the difference!

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.080
<i>You Emperor punks,</i>
<i>or whatever you call yourselves...</i>

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.820
<i>...I will defend Gunma!</i>

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:00.280
<i>And you'll be buried deep</i>
<i>at the bottom of Myogi Valley!</i>

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.880
<i>If I don't stop them, who will?!</i>

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.350
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.420
<i>"Team Emperor on Akina!"</i>

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.750
<i>Anyone who doesn't watch this is beneath me!</i>
