Hi, Kenji!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.180
Were you daydreaming, Itsuki?

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.590
Well...

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.420
He's been like this for a while.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.920
Huh?

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.290
I'm free the rest of the day,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.100
so I thought maybe we could hang out.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.470
I'll wait somewhere until
you're done with work.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.640
Can you hold on a sec?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.940
Wait here for two... one minute!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.100

--Boss!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.680
I'm leaving early for personal reasons!

--Hop in, Kazumi!
--Is it really okay?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.490
Yeah, come on!

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.210
I guess I'll give him a break just this once.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.950
Who is that girl? His new girlfriend?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.380
Something like that.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.220
What? He just got dumped.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.590
He got another girl already?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.890

I'm sure.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.420
<i>...made me so happy!</i>

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.360
<i>So leaving work is no big deal.</i>

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.850
When I was growing up, I always
hung out with my brother.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.390
Yeah?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.860
You two still seem very close.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.360
After he got into racing,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.630
I'd always go with him to his races.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.530
There was a time when I was using

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.700
most of my salary to maintain his car.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.170
Really?

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.470
There was nothing I wanted to do.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.480
It was easy to just follow
my car-crazed brother.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.980
But that's no good.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.850
He and I are two different people.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.320
I need to find out what I want to do.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.910
Yeah.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.990
Unfortunately...

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.400
...there's nothing I'm
passionate about right now.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.560
But I'll find out what my dream is.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.070
Until now, I haven't had
anyone to talk to like this.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.080

want to go home last night.

You're probably wondering
how I got your number.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.570
I remembered the
Fujiwara Tofu Shop emblem...

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.680
...on your car.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.550
I'll be coming to Gunma
tomorrow to get my sister.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.950
I heard she took off from work yesterday

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.420
and didn't come back until this morning.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.590
So irresponsible!

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.190
I can't stand irresponsible people,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.600
But that's my problem. Let's talk business.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.070
Leave tomorrow night open.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.740
Make sure your engine is
fully operational by then,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.980
or it'll be pointless.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.610

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.060
Hey, Takumi.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.100
What's up?

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.590
I have a favor to ask.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.170
I may be racing the
Eight-Six Turbo tomorrow night,

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.510
so I want to make this engine usable by then.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.010
I need your help installing a tachometer.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.910
A tachometer?

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.180

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.690

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.220
Please show me how!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.890
Okay.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.900
I don't know the specifics,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.730
but I can tell that this engine
isn't just another engine.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.370
--Yeah.
--It has a good carburetor

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.270
and a wildly twisted header.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.640
It's a new five-valve engine,

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.650
and it's really tuned-up.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.880
It sure is hard to believe that this engine

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.920
has less power than the old one.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.550
This Wataru guy

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.260
said that I would get
more power at a higher rpm.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.330
I want to believe what he said.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.930
Unlocking a sealed high-rev zone...

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.500
If that's true, it's exciting.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.840
It's not that hard to install a tachometer,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.410
but there's one thing I'm not so sure about.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.580
Are you sure you want to
change the current setup

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.880
without asking your dad first?

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.790
My dad wasn't home tonight.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.360
And he wouldn't say yes

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.860
if I asked him face to face.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.760
So, I've decided to do it myself.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.970
I want to be able to use the
engine to its full potential

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.770
by tomorrow night.

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.140
Okay.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.810
In that case, I'll help you.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.310
I'll buy a tachometer
first thing in the morning.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.040
After school,

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.810
bring the car here as fast as you can.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.150
Thank you so much, Iketani!

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.220
You're a huge help.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.050
You and your Eight-Six

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.060
have saved my butt many times,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.190
so this is the least I can do.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.900
What?! It'll take a week?

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.090
I need it today.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.870
This is bad! No one has it in stock.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.370
I guess very few cars

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.180
use 10,000 rpm tachometers.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.180
What am I going to tell Takumi?

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.350
I guess no one carries it.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.420
Boss, do you know anyone?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.050
Well, maybe I do.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.460
Hello?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.560
Hey, Yuichi.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.730
Yeah, I have one.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.030
What?! Are you sure you have one, Masashi?

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.640
Bunta asked me to get one for his Eight-Six.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.170
A racing tachometer, and water
temperature and oil pressure gauges.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.640
Hold on.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.910
This is a surprise, Iketani!

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.250
I've got goose bumps!

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.050
This is what Bunta meant by "sealing it."

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:27.150
Hey, Masashi! Bring those
gauges over here right now!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.330
Hey, Takumi!

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.990
What's your hurry?

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.170
<i>Mogi!</i>

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.670
Hi, Takumi...

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.020
Sorry, but I'm busy right now.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.780
But, Takumi!

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.290
<i>Takumi...</i>

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.630
<i>Mogi...</i>

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.570
Okay, now you just have to screw it down.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.160
That's it.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.640
Now it's done.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.980
Wasn't that easy?

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.310
Thanks to you guys.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.990
I wouldn't have known how to do it alone.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:35.360
Installing the tachometer isn't the end of it.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.660
Just because it's a high-rev engine

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.160
doesn't mean that it'll rev infinitely.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.000
Without knowing its top rpm,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.530
you can't have a full-blast race.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.670
I'm sure your dad knows.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.500
If you don't know its limit,

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.680
you may end up damaging this engine.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.940
My dad.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.710
Isn't that...?

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.630
It looks like you're ready.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.970
We'll race tonight as planned.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.700
I'll let you pick the course for our race.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.810
Haven't we seen that Eight-Six Turbo before?

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.480
Yeah, and he's Itsuki's girlfriend's brother.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.480
What?! That sounds very complicated.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.480
Okay, that's fine.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.650
I'll see you there.

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.210
Later.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.830
Takumi, where are you two racing?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.540
We'll come root for you.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.800 line:50 %
"Matsuya Inn"

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.240
Big brother!

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.210
This is serious.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.780
I told you not to make our aunt look bad.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.880
You made Mom and Dad worry.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.790
Get your stuff together tonight.
I'm taking you home.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.790
That's my decision to make!

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.500
It was wrong to stay out till morning
without letting anyone know.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.970
But I did nothing I'm ashamed of,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.300
so I shouldn't have to go home!

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.800
Why don't you explain that

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.640
to Mom and Dad instead of me?

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.640
If you like it here,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.510
you can tell them so and come back.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.850
I can tell you've changed a little,

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.850
and I have to admit

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.220
that you've even matured a little.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.560
But they don't know that, so they worry.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.020
They'll feel better if they hear it from you.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.600
Okay, I'll go.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.370 line:50 %
"Takeuchi"

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.500
What's going on?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.310
I'm racing tonight.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.010
What?! With who?

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.210
Not with Kazumi's brother?

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.680
Yeah, and I have a favor to ask.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.220
I'm a little scared, so can you come with me?

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.560
Yeah, of course.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.890
Thanks. I'll pick you up later.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.550
What is it?

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.720
I'm racing in this car tonight.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.860
It has a new tachometer.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.830
Please tell me what the top rpm is.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.760
Please.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.380
Make sure to rev up to 11,000 rpm.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.450
Don't lose.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.100
Thanks, Dad.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.640
Takumi, why are we taking the highway?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.480
He told me to pick any course I wanted.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.150
So, where did you pick?

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.150
Shomaru Pass.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.280
What?! That's his turf!

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.750
<i>Takumi's new engine vs. Wataru's turbo engine!</i>

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.480
<i>The climax!</i>

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.750
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.750
<i>"Eight-Six vs. Eight-Six: A Spirited Race."</i>

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.480
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
