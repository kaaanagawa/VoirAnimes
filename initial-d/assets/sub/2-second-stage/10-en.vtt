00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.450
They didn't need you on a Sunday afternoon?

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.790
Maybe you aren't that useful.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.390
How rude!

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.190
It was super busy in the morning.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.700
I've worked two weeks straight,
so they gave me an afternoon off.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.400
That's okay, then.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.610
Why did you come here, anyway?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.680
Well, I wanted to see how you were doing.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.010
Mom and Dad worry about you.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.350
I'm fine. I'm working very hard.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.750
I hope so.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.220
I'm low on gas. I should fill up.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.160
My friend works at a gas station.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.680
Welcome!

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.230
Hey!

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.450
Big brother, that's Itsuki.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.620
Welcome!

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.590
Twenty liters of high octane.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.180
Right away!

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.790
<i>Her brother is really good-looking!</i>

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.360
<i>I've seen that Eight-Six Turbo.</i>

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.810
I hear you and my sister are friends.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.810
Isn't she too strong-willed?

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.310
No, I don't think so.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.810
Hey, big brother!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.220
Don't ask him stupid things like that!

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.220
She's a good girl, so be nice.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.880
Yes.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.490
This is a complete change of topic,

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.900
but I hear that Gunma
has a really fast Eight-Six.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.400
What?

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.170
They say he's undefeated.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.340
I know Gunma is pretty big,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.670
but I thought you might
know something about him.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.040
Of course I do! He's my friend.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.850
--Seriously?
--Yes.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.020
Itsuki, wasn't it?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.850
I know we've only just met,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.360
but do you think you could
arrange a meeting with him?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.360
I want to talk to him.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.060
I'm curious about his Eight-Six.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.800
Piece of cake!

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.200
He's a bit slow, but he's a nice guy.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.300
How about tonight?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.340
--You sure?
--No problem!

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.510
I was planning to go see
him after work anyway.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.880
That'd be great.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.980
Thank you very much!

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.490
I can't believe he's your friend's friend.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.320
I'm thankful that you guys became friends.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.160
I don't like this.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
You seem to only care about Itsuki's friend,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.860
and not about Itsuki.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.830
That's not true. He seems okay.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.500
Why are you meeting his friend?

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.340
No reason.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.610
I just want to meet him.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.010
He must be skilled to have won
all his races in competitive Gunma.

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.110
I hope that's it.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.620
You tend to lose your cool

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.450
when it comes to street racing.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.730
Come on, Takumi!

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.060
I just want Kazumi's brother to like me.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.900
This is a good opportunity
for me to score some points.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.300
Okay, I'll be there.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.810
But I'm not interested in racing him at all.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.410
The new engine isn't that good.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.410
Don't worry about that!

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.820
I learned my lesson after the thing
with the Night Kids' Nakazato.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.650
Kazumi's brother seems very nice.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.210
You'll see when you meet him.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.520
<i>It's cool to see three Eight-Sixes!</i>

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.820
<i>But mine is an Eight-Five.</i>

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320
<i>He's young.</i>

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.830
You know that Eight-Six Turbo
that came in this afternoon?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.230
I saw it once...

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.300
...when I went to see the
Red Suns race the Emperors.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.710
Yeah?

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.380
It had amazing uphill acceleration.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.040
Since her brother drives a car like that,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.350
Kazumi may not be that impressed with Itsuki.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.220
There you go again, Iketani.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.990
Your way of thinking
won't help your social life.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:47.360
Itsuki doesn't look like he
worries about things like that.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.730
Clumsy but positive guys have an upper hand

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.070
over guys who worry too much.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.160
You're still young.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.240
You just got a new engine?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.010
Yeah, but it's a lot slower than the old one.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.680
--Right, Takumi?
--Yeah.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.350
That's why he won't be able to race for a while.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.880
--Right?
--Yeah, that's right.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.690
Is it a normal 4AG?

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.200
I don't know much about engines.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.200
It has okay power,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.200
but it's hard to control.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.730
It's a weird engine.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.810
Do you mind if I take a look?

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.250
Uh, no, I don't mind.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.920
What is this?!

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.400
It's not a 4AG, even though it is a 4AG.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.840
Is this a joke?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.310
Are you teasing me?

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.780
I don't know where you got this engine...

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.550
...but don't insult me by saying that it's slow.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.890
Well, but, um...

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.060
--Why is he mad?
--Who knows?

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.230
I thought we were fellow Eight-Six racers.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.900
Is my cheap turbo not good enough for you?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.900
You owe me an explanation.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.630
Stop it, big brother!

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.640
What are you talking about?

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.710
Stay out of this, Kazumi.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:43.380
I've never met anyone who has
an engine like this for street racing.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.480
This engine is for professional racing.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.680
What?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.480
I could never afford it...

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.820
...no matter how much I wanted it.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:58.230
Picturing this engine in my
Eight-Six makes my mouth water.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.890
So what?

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.560
I don't care what kind of engine you have.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:04.900
But why lie about it?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.040
Why can't you say you're fast?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.570
Both of you disgust me
with your deliberate lies.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.740
We weren't, really...

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.440
Don't be ridiculous.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.780
It's not a lie.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.950
Let's go, Itsuki. I'm done talking to him.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.590
--Takumi!
--Running away?

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.020
I'm not done with you.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.790
<i>Oh, no! Takumi is losing it!</i>

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.230
<i>This is not good!</i>

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.570
Kazumi!

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.400
I...

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.360
What's the matter with you, big brother?!

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.530
Itsuki introduced his friend
to you out of kindness.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.090
Apologize to them!

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.910
If you don't want to, then go
and never come back here!

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.340
<i>Kazumi...</i>

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.840
Don't be rude to my friend!

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.550
I'm doing my best to live on my own here.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.920
Don't show up randomly and mess up my life!

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.120
Okay.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.350
I'll go, then.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.420
--Itsuki?
--Yeah?

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.750
I'm going, too.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.250
Hey, wait! Don't leave me here alone!

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.220
--Later.
--Hey!

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.430
Hey, wait, Takumi! Takumi!

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.020
Hey, Takumi!

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.580
<i>I didn't expect her...</i>

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.090
<i>...to react like that at all.</i>

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:46.230
<i>I guess coming to Gunma was</i>
<i>a good thing for her after all.</i>

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.130
<i>But for me...</i>

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.150
I'm sorry.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.490
He gets so intense when it comes to cars.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.260
There's no need to apologize.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.260
When I saw your confused face,

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:26.230
I got so angry with Wataru.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.100
My hand moved before I could stop it.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.700
Please don't think that I have a short temper.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.350
Don't worry!

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.720
Actually, I was sort of glad.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.550
I know that you got upset because

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.220
you wanted to defend us.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.760
Why did you stop?

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.730
You know I wouldn't have chased after you.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.430
Now that you're here,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.670
I may want to pick up where we left off.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:05.140
I don't care what you want,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.740
but there is one thing I need to know.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.050
I need to know for sure if this engine...

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.420
...is that great.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.020
I can tell it's not a normal engine,

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.220
but if you're right and this is a great engine,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.920
I want to know why it lacks power.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.070
I know absolutely nothing about engines.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.900
Are you serious about that?

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.010
How can the owner not know about his car?

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.680
Where did you get this treasure, then?

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.010
My dad got this engine somewhere.

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.080
I don't know, because he
didn't tell me anything.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.860
Your dad? He must work
in the racing industry, then.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.090
No, he runs a tofu shop.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.460
<i>How can a tofu guy get this kind of engine?</i>

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:07.470
<i>This isn't something you</i>
<i>can simply buy with money.</i>

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:13.310
Never mind. I, too, am curious
about this engine's full potential.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.040
Can you drive me around?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.540
I want to feel the engine for myself.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.320
What's your plan now, Bunta?

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.890
Well, I imagined it would take about a month.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.730
He's had more than enough practice with it.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.670
The thing you ordered is here already.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.370
Isn't it about time?

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.400
I don't know.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.100
I haven't gotten enough of
a reaction from Takumi yet.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.950
It's good that he's trying to
compensate with his technique,

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.610
but he should've noticed by now.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.450
Well, I'll just wait and see.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.370
<i>It feels weird. The shifting</i>
<i>stalls the acceleration.</i>

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.980
<i>It has tons of power at the rev limit,</i>

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.480
<i>but up-shifting causes a power loss.</i>

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.410
<i>This engine is defective.</i>

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.980
<i>No need to compare it to a turbo. It's dull.</i>

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.850
<i>Why? This can't be its full potential.</i>

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.520
What the...?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.940
<i>Again! Why?</i>

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.020
<i>Now I get it! I know why.</i>

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:14.660
I can tell you why you don't get much power.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.230
It's very simple and basic.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.530
That thing.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.140
It's your tachometer.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.370
My tachometer?

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.870
That tachometer is no good.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.810
It doesn't go high enough.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:35.720
This is a "high-rev" engine that
generates its power at a very high rpm.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:40.720
Professional "normally aspirated"
engines are all like this.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.720
The fact that you get a surge of power

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.160
right before shifting is proof of that.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.400
You need to rev it higher.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.730
You haven't been able to
use it to its full capacity.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.870
I would say that this engine is capable of...

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.670
...at least 10,000 rpm.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.280
A tachometer that only shows
7,000 rpm or so won't cut it.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.210
The treasure is left unused.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.390
This isn't an original Eight-Six engine.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.960
It's called a "4AG,"

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.960
but it's a five-valve-head engine

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.300
that was adapted from the newer "101."

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.300
There's supposed to be a "VVT" device

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.400
that switches valve timing
at lower and higher rpms.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.470
Its absence means that

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.740
this is a super high-rev engine.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.920
I noticed something while sitting next to you.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.150
The interior panel looks too cheap

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.690
for the engine you have.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.230
At least, you need water temperature
and oil pressure gauges.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.030
The person who installed this engine

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.900
has terrific knowledge of auto mechanics.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.930
The tires and the brakes are well balanced.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.970
So is the body.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.970
So, why aren't the essential gauges there?

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.440
There's only one answer to that question.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.610
For whatever reason,

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.780
the engine's true power has
been sealed off on purpose.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.480
Sealed off?

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.650
It's a simple but reliable way to do it.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.660
A good racer won't over-rev.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.290
So, without a new tachometer,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.560
he won't rev beyond the red zone.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.370
I've often felt camaraderie
toward fellow Eight-Six racers...

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.670
...but never hostility.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.380
This is a first for me.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.310
I have a strong desire to defeat you now.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.420
No matter how well you can race,

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.350
you're lacking an essential element as a racer.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.260
Huh?

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:59.260
I absolutely can't lose to you.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.320
We'll settle this shortly.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.410
I'm lacking...

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.680
...an essential element?

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.260
<i>I'm in shock.</i>

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.420
<i>I got scared.</i>

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.870
<i>The way he entered corners was beyond belief.</i>

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.300
<i>He can go way beyond the limit</i>

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.940
<i>that my body is used to.</i>

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.940
<i>He's ignorant about cars,</i>

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.610
<i>but his technique is unreal!</i>

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.250
<i>It makes no sense!</i>

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.980
<i>If I lose to him,</i>

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.450
<i>everything that I am will shatter into pieces.</i>

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.580
<i>My very existence depends on this!</i>

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Furikaereba itsudatte</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>Kawaranu kimi no egao ga atta</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>Arukitsukare tachidomaru hi mo</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>Chiisa na yorokobi no hi mo</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>Kono ryoute ni kakaekirenai</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>Ai wo oshiete kureta</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>Atatakaku</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Sotto yasashiku yomigaeru kaze wa</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>Ima hitori sora wo</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>Mitsumeteru boku ni hohoendeiru</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>Mada ano hi no mama no</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Mabushisa de te wo futteiru</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>Kimi wa everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.350
<i>Wataru challenges Takumi!</i>
<i>The race is about to start!</i>

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.550
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.420
<i>"The Seal Is Broken."</i>

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.010
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
