Dad, shouldn't we pull out the electric heater?

Laziness makes you cold, so stay busy.

I have something to tell you, Takumi.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.120
I had to use your hard-earned
money to fix this car...

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.460
...so it's half yours from now on.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.860
What?!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.030
But I'm the one who broke
the car! Are you sure?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.270
A mistake didn't cause it,
so it wasn't your fault.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.740
I used up the savings not only
from your part-time job,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.540
but also from your morning deliveries.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.840
You're entitled to feel attached to it.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.480
I see.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.250
Anyway, I've already made up my mind.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.050
So go on and finish the deliveries.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.250
Okay.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.170
It feels weird.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.780
Your eye level is lower
because of the bucket seat.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.180
After a while, you won't notice it.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.250

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.910

You'll be disappointed if I tell you this.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.560
It may be slower than the old one.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.960

Hey, Takumi!

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.590
Why do you say that the
new engine lacks power?

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.920
It just feels slower.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.590
It can't be slower.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.060

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.400
He said that?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.570
I don't think so.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.170
It's hard to control.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.670
But it's hard to control because it has

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.680
so much more power, right?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.180
I know it's a good engine.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.950

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.320
What?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.620
Have you driven it?!

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.120
No, I, uh, haven't driven it.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.130
I don't know what's going on, actually.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.360
<i>What's going on, Bunta?</i>

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.060
<i>That engine has less power?</i>

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.170
Wow! It has a roll bar and a bucket seat!

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.840
This is so cool!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.510
If I had an Eight-Six, it would be like this!

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.680
Hey! It has a boost meter, too!

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.020
That means this Eight-Six is...

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.690
...a turbo!

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.320

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.530
Well, you know, I was just...

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.700
...admiring your car.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.870

it doesn't have a Gunma plate?

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.720
Are you kidding, or what?!

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.990
Why would I do that?!

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.990
You don't need to yell at me! What's with you?!

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.000
For your information, I just love Eight-Sixes!

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.630

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.040

Yeah.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.720
There!

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.020
<i>That engine sound...</i>

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.540
Big brother, wasn't that...?

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.870
Yeah. He isn't used to it yet...

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.540
...but that car's been
revived as a scary monster.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.760
It took you a long time. Anything happen?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.260
No.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.100
After the deliveries,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.660
I drove the pass a few times.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.830
I used a lot of gas.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.670
Sorry.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.510
I don't mind.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.180
--Dad?
--Yeah?

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:44.380
Cornering with this car is tough.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.180
What I could do before

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.450
isn't as easy with this car.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.450
It's upsetting me.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.410
I've been trying different things,
but it's not going very well.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.390
<i>Good attitude.</i>

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.530
<i>He's trying to compensate with his technique</i>

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.530
<i>instead of changing the suspension settings.</i>

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.870
<i>Go ahead and struggle for a while.</i>

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:13.140
<i>Trial and error is an important process.</i>

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:20.850
<i>In time, this car will improve your</i>
<i>technique without your even knowing.</i>

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.050
<i>This car will be a tool for you</i>

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.380
<i>to move up to the next level.</i>

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.600
Oh, there you are!

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.830
Hey! Kazumi!

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.440
I'm here to pay you back.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.710
Here.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.610
Now we're even.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.940
Yeah.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.250
--You really saved me yesterday!
--Oh, yeah?

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.750
Hey, who is that?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.740
See you at 7:30!

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.160
Who is that cutie, Itsuki?

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.990
She's, uh, a friend.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.960
A friend?!

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.030
You said we racers don't need girls!

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.530
What happened to "Lonely Driver Itsuki"?

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.060
Don't just laugh it off!

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.840
What?

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.520
No way. It's a Levin!

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.820
Is this really your car?

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.490
It sure is.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.930
Oh, me?

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.400
I graduated from high school this spring,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.770
so I'm a year older than you.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.440
What did you do after you graduated?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.940
I got a job, sort of.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.280
But I didn't like it there.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:01.220
My brother often tells me
that I'm a little impatient.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.380
The one with the Eight-Six?

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.320
Yeah. You may think it's odd,

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.490
but we were always together,
even when he went racing.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.660
They say he's the fastest
downhill racer in Saitama.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.200
Wataru's downhill is--

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.030
My big brother's name is Wataru.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.530
They say Wataru's downhill is sharp.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.470
He's starting to use me

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.740
as an excuse to come to Gunma.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:34.680
He may be racing at some pass right now.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.420
I'm sorry.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.430
It's our policy not to race in Akagi.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.390
Is it because I drive an Eight-Six?

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.660
No, it's because it's too easy.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:57.500
Racers in Gunma know that the
Red Suns don't race on their own turf.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.530
It's nothing personal.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.710
I'll tell you one thing.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.710
We take Eight-Six racers seriously.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.550
Gunma's Eight-Six is a downhill specialist.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.720
He has never lost a race.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.160
What?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.460
Against any type of car.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.790
Any type of car?

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.730
Right.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.730
Then you're qualified to
determine if I'm faster than he is.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.400
--What?
--It's okay, Kenta.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.700
We don't race here.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.640
I don't know who you are,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.240
but come back in ten years if
you want to talk trash to Keisuke.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.550
Fine, then.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.540
<i>I hate to do this, but you've left me no choice.</i>

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.980
<i>If you're that desperate,</i>
<i>I'll play with you a little!</i>

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.390
<i>That's more like it.</i>

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:26.160
<i>Please teach that rude jerk a lesson!</i>

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.400
<i>That sound... it's a turbo!</i>

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.240
<i>He followed me out of the corner.</i>

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.980
<i>That car's power isn't ordinary.</i>

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.250
<i>Is it really an Eight-Six?</i>

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.890
<i>I don't know how powerful it is,</i>

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:04.260
<i>but that much power will impede his control.</i>

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.270
<i>That car is like a loose cannon,</i>

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.540
<i>but he's controlling it!</i>

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.510
<i>I just can't keep up!</i>

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.500
<i>Darn!</i>

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.180
<i>I don't know as much as my brother,</i>

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.790
<i>but this guy is very skilled.</i>
<i>I shouldn't mess around.</i>

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.190
<i>Get serious... or I'll pass you!</i>

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.700
Man, this doesn't look good.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.030
Luckily, we weren't going too fast.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.400
Yeah.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.210
I should put a warning reflector up.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.870
I'd hate for another car to crash into us.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.540
Yeah.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.180
<i>Hearing the rumors,</i>
<i>Wataru approaches Takumi!</i>

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.720
<i>What will happen?</i>

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.980
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.750
<i>"The Eight-Six Turbo!"</i>

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.520
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
