<i>I couldn't sleep at all last night.</i>

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.240
<i>No Eight-Six.</i>

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.950
<i>I feel like I've lost something important,</i>

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.380
<i>like a family member.</i>

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.260
Hey!

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.330
You look perfectly half-asleep, as usual.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.870
It's too early to be acting so hyper, Itsuki.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.870
Why are you so excited?

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.200
Why else?!

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.370
Today is the day the Red Suns
and the Emperors square off!

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.280
I'm already so nervous that I can't even go pee.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.580
We should carpool like we did

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.250
when we went to Myogi.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.780
I'm wondering if we can take your Eight-Six.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.630
Maybe you didn't hear me.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.100
I said I was wondering if we
could take your Eight-Six...

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.070
Hey, wait up, Takumi!

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.310
Anyway, I'm so excited about tonight's race!

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.810
Any predictions?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.820
I predict that Ryosuke
Takahashi is going to win.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.090
I don't think the Emperors' Sudo is that good.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.820
He just drives a better car.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.990
Stop talking about things
you don't understand.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.930
Why are you mad?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.840
It's not that I'm mad.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.840
Something came up,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.870
so I can't go to Akagi with you tonight.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.540
Why not?!

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.210
I just can't, so go with Iketani and Kenji.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.090
--What?! Takumi lost?
--Yes.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.100
He really did go to Akagi last night.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.100
Rumor has it that his Eight-Six
stopped during the race.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.400
Stopped?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.070
Do you mean it's damaged,
or that he blew the engine?

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.580
We don't exactly know what really happened.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.850
We're all panicking here.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.250
We thought you might know
something about it, boss.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.750
Takumi's dad is your friend.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.420
Sorry, I don't know anything.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
Hang on. I'll call him.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.040
He isn't answering.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.210
Takumi's probably at school, too.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.870
It's very irritating that we don't know.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.250
Hey! It's Keisuke Takahashi.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.290
Is Takumi Fujiwara here?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.060
He's off today.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.130
I see. I was hoping I could talk to him directly.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.500
I have a message for him.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.070
Last night's race doesn't count.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.170
I don't accept it.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.240
It was too strange to be considered a race.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.480
I don't know what others think of it,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.810
but I don't agree that
Takumi Fujiwara was defeated.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.920
One more thing.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.860
We will avenge his Eight-Six.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.930
We will be happy to break the
conceited Emperor's nose for him.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.520
Later.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.770
We'll give him the message.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.570
Good luck with tonight's battle.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.700
We'll be rooting for you.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.590
What?!

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.910
<i>Not good!</i>

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.840
Hey!

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.880
Itsuki... don't you think
this rock is a little too big?

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.650
You could've broken the window.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.850
I looked for smaller ones,
but I couldn't find any.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.660
I figured it would be okay if I threw it lightly.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.330
It's not okay!

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.300
You would've broken the glass for sure.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.540
Oh, sorry!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.740
I didn't do it on purpose!

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.670
I guess I deserved it...

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.750
I told you that I wasn't going to Akagi.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:35.340
I know. I decided not to go, either.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.260
Instead, I was going to Akina Pass for a drive.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.420
Wanna come along?

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.170
Hey, Takumi?

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.610
I'm sorry about this morning.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.600
I didn't know.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.950
I don't care about that,

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.290
but you heard about last night already?

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.020
I heard it from Iketani after school.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.990
They know, too, then.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.400
Yeah, I hear everyone in
town is talking about it.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.370
Everyone notices you.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.970
By the way, Iketani told me
to give you this message.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.350
Hey, this car is right on my tail.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.530
He's probably going to see tonight's race.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.700
I guess so...

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.870
...but he's making me nervous

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.670
because he's so close to me.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.930
I'll speed up a little.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.150
He's trying to pass us.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.810
You should let him.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.480
What's he driving?

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.380
What?!

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.630
An Eight-Six Levin!

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.970
With turbo!

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:35.140
I heard the waste gate pass the exhaust gas!

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:39.910
He passed my SR-20 turbo like it was parked!

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.910
Unbelievable! This is uphill, too!

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.750
<i>Where did he come from?</i>

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.840
<i>Have I seen that Eight-Six around here?</i>

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.760
Keisuke Takahashi came to
the gas station and told them

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.330
that he doesn't think you lost last night's race.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.170
I don't know what he means by that.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.370
I did lose, because I was
completely outmatched.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.570
The Emperors' Sudo was really that good?

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.080
He was. I would've lost to him even in Akina.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.880
I see.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.880
So how is the Eight-Six?

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.850
You can fix it, right?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.520
My dad thinks it needs a new engine.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.860
--What?
--I shouldn't have gone to Akagi.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.230
I'm regretting it big time.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.650
The air is full of tension.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.050
Did you hear about last night?

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.260
Yeah. Akina's Eight-Six lost, right?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.830
I hear that Kyoichi Sudo's
technique is beyond belief.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.260
I guess Ryosuke Takahashi
is Gunma's last hope.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.330
I want him to win no matter what.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.280
So, Shingo, you came to see the battle, too?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.950
Hey, Takeshi.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.420
I figured I would root for the Red Suns tonight.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.030
Ryosuke Takahashi won't lose.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.130
We can't have the Lan-Evo
squad looking down on Gunma.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.030
Yeah... Hey!

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.940
We're too close again. Let's keep our distance.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.390
An Eight-Six!

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.820
--Akina's Eight-Six?
--No way, it has a Saitama plate.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.500
This is a good spot, Kazumi.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.200
Yeah.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.460
Here comes the Lan-Evo squad!

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.630
Good luck, Red Suns!

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.880
Do you have anything to say, Ryosuke?

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.080
Not really.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.720
Tonight's battle only involves you and me.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.390
That's more like it.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.020
Let's start a real race, shall we?

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.340
Remember, you told me

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.240
that you wouldn't race in Akina anymore?

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.510
When I heard that,
I thought you were so brave.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:44.620
Your wanting to race elsewhere impressed me.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.220
Wrong!

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.560
It wasn't like that last night.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.900
Something awful happened and I was furious.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.570
I was so mad that I didn't
know what I was doing.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.040
That's why I ruined the car.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.640
It was probably a punishment.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.910
I shouldn't have been racing a
car when I was feeling like that.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.680
I know that now.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.080
I can accept the loss,
because I wasn't good enough.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.090
But I can't stop regretting

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.720
destroying my dad's precious car.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.490
Takumi...

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.340
What's the strategy, Kyoichi?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.200
Simulation X.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.070
"X"? Do we have an "X"?

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.740
Ryosuke is an exception.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.750
It's a special strategy for this battle.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.910
I'll win with Simulation X.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.290
I'm starting the countdown!

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.420
Five...

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.520
Four... Three...

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.790
Two... One...

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.390
Go!

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.170
<i>As long as my brother runs his normal race,</i>

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.840
<i>he won't lose to that Lan-Evo.</i>

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.090
What sharp cornering by Ryosuke Takahashi!

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.850
How odd! Ryosuke usually lets
his opponent take the lead.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.680
What will happen next?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.190
Awesome! Both cars are so intense!

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.850
This race is so thrilling.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:04.120
Can you see their subtle strategies, Kazumi?

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.190
What?

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.130
The Evo III had a quick start,
but he didn't fully accelerate.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.800
When they entered the first
corner all tangled up,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.860
it seemed to me that the
Evo III retreated a little.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.480
Perhaps the Evo III chose to stay behind

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.810
as part of some strategy.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.980
It was worth coming to Akagi

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.540
to be able to see a race like this.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.100
<i>I can win. I can win this race!</i>

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.930
<i>By staying behind,</i>

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.940
<i>I can see what Ryosuke is trying to do.</i>

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.610
<i>I've got him.</i>

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.740
<i>All the uncertainties in my head are gone now.</i>

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.670
<i>I haven't forgotten it, Ryosuke.</i>

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.840
<i>What you told me a year ago....</i>

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.740
<i>...after I lost to you.</i>

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.880
Don't let this go to your head!

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.890
I still don't accept street racers.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:42.050
They're all mediocre racers!

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.760
The motor sport technique developed
to achieve maximum speed

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.700
can't be inferior to primitive street technique!

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.330
That's what I believe.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.840
You can believe what you want,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.440
but the mountain pass
requires its own technique.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.280
You won't succeed with just
the technique you learned

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.950
at Gymkhana and other circuits.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.950
That can't possibly be right!

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.480
Kyoichi!

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.120
I don't intend to continue this
fruitless conversation with you.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.150
It won't lead to an answer.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.800
If you believe your theory
is right, then defeat me.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.960
If you can't, then it's just a theory.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.910
<i>I won't forget this.</i>

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.240
<i>I'll defeat you,</i>

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.580
<i>and make you taste this same anguish.</i>

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.650
<i>I haven't forgotten it, Ryosuke.</i>

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.490
<i>I know you know it, too.</i>

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:53.230
<i>All of our racing theories and personal beliefs</i>

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.430
<i>are riding on this race tonight.</i>

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.780
<i>Ryosuke...</i>

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.880
<i>You said the mountain pass</i>
<i>requires its own technique.</i>

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.450
<i>The boldness to take the shortest line...</i>

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.160
<i>...heel and toe...</i>

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.290
<i>...and the all-wheel drift</i>
<i>with zero countersteering.</i>

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.990
<i>You sure are fast.</i>

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.630
<i>But what's so special about your technique?</i>

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.230
<i>You're merely using circuit racing technique!</i>

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.410
<i>If you seek speed,</i>

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.740
<i>you'll end up having to rely</i>
<i>on motor sport technique!</i>

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.040
<i>My theory is right!</i>

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.360
Ryosuke's FC is moving smoothly.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.350
The Evo III is right with him.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.530
Here they come! Who's ahead?

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.930
The FC or the Evo III?

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.670
It's the FC!

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:13.400
<i>I'll show you how much I've</i>
<i>grown since last year, Ryosuke!</i>

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.130
<i>This is where my 4WD and</i>
<i>the misfiring system excel!</i>

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.920
What?! The Evo III passed
Ryosuke Takahashi's FC!

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.280
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.550
<i>There was always that</i>
<i>unchanging smile of yours</i>

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:34.220
<i>It was there on days when</i>
<i>I was too tired to go on</i>

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:43.030
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:51.610
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.710
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:07.850
<i>The warm wind</i>

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:15.530
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:23.540
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:30.780
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:48.680
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:57.070
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.510
<i>The Eight-Six is running again?!</i>

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.580
<i>The Eight-Six was seen in Akina!</i>

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.820
<i>Next on Initial D: Second Stage...</i>

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.420
<i>"Dangerous Car."</i>

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.150
<i>Don't miss it!</i>
