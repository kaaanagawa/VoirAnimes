Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.270
Oh man, it's finally starting to rain.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.580
Really?

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.500
Yeah, it's coming down really hard.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.700
What does the forecast say?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.500
We can't trust it, especially when
it involves mountain weather.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.100
The half wet surface will be tricky.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.700
Either full wet or full dry is better.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.130
No need to worry.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
I kinda prefer difficult conditions.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.380
I get more excited as the
accelerator work gets more severe.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.100
I don't hate wet roads either.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.000
People say it's scary because you
don't know when you'll start to skid.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.150
But I've never felt like that
while driving my Eight-Six.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.850
I know how much I'll skid before entering a corner, so I just drive like I usually do.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.610
Show off.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.200
That's my main dish!

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.500
I was saving it for later!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.000
It rained after all.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.800
We can't do anything about God's will.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.740
Poor conditions are
perfect for my Zero theory.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.170
This is a suitable setup for a street
race where everything is unpredictable.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.250
Besides, that Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.700
I sense something special about that guy.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.080
Open, wide, deep, and gentle.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.000
So then why does he seem
to hold such sadness?

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.550
Hey, Ryosuke, you're up early.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.720
I can manage even with
only three hours of sleep.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.000
Besides that, Fumihiro, Spiral's
Ikeda is one interesting guy.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.960
He published his Zero theory for driving
on his site, and it's quite unique.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.800
It's interesting because there
are so many similarities to mine.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.370
With your theory of fastest street driving?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.280
Keisuke will have a hard time.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.280
It's not going to be
easy for him to win.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.400
We have a chance of winning, don't we?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.830
Sure. It's my job to find it.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.150
Act 7  [ Mindset of Nothingness ]

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.300
Geez, it's raining.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.510
It must be the same in Hakone.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.830
I hate tackling mountain passes in the rain.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.900
I can never tell when my car is going to skid,
and the brakes don't work like they should.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.500
Visibility is poor, too.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.250
It's really strange.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:50.170
Night rain makes everything so dark,
even with the headlights on.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.930
I think you can only see half
of what you see on a clear night.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.560
On top of that, the wipers block the view.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.950
Nothing scares me more
than losing the ability to see.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.650
Speaking of which

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.500
remember when I got to ride in Takumi's
Eight-Six when he fought a rain battle at night?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.600
Yeah, Takumi was incredible that time.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.230
He totally owned his opponent
with extraordinary speed.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.950
I was watching Takumi's impressive
steering work from the rear seat.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.960
I wondered why he didn't crash,
even though he couldn't see a thing.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.000
He was going flat out, and entered the
corner sideways at incredible speed.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.650
I can't express how scary it was.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.370
Your facial expression
is more scary than that.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.700
I know that fear, too.
I fainted from it once.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.550
It's more than just driving
skills, it's something special.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.500
I think Takumi can see.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.400
Like, he has some special.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.000
Like he has another eye, and that he can
clearly see his surroundings with it or something.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.840
That's why I don't think rain
will put him in a difficult position.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.520
Stop.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.000
How's the surface?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I didn't see any water flowing across it.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.800
The rain has stopped in almost
every part of the course.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.620
I think it'll stay like that.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.990
The forecast didn't anticipate heavy rain, so
I think the road conditions will remain the same.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.030
Okay, we'll go with the half wet pattern B.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.020
Keisuke, did you see any fog?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.800
Well, it was misty here and there

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.000
but not thick enough to block my view.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.700
I see.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.210
Is it time already?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.130
I always wonder what's on your
mind whenever you meditate.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.730
Nothing at all.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.210
Eh?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.400
To meditate is to empty your mind.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.450
I intentionally didn't come up
with any plans for this race.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.410
Desire for victory exposes human weakness.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.240
I'll just try to bring the
very best out of my car.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.200
When I manage to do so,
the result will follow.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.260
What I need is a mindset of Zero.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.850
I'll be the lead for the first run.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:23.000
As soon as we pass under the
tollway overpass, go full throttle.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.660
Let's begin.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.000
Pro-D and Spiral's match is about to begin.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.300
Too bad the road is wet.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.000
I wanted to see their
dynamic full throttle hill climb.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:44.650
It's a battle between fast cars, but
they can't open the throttle too much.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.000
It means we won't see
their top speeds in this race.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.150
No, I don't think so.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.990
Even if they don't reach their top speed,
it'll be an exchange of high level skills.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:09:02.300
Under these conditions, those cars are required to
have a high level of total balance, instead of power.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.800
Depending on how you look at it, it's going to
be an interesting battle that will excite
those with sophisticated eyes.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.000
The rain pisses me off.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.600
If the road is wet, it's pointless to have
increased power and fatter tires.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.930
It stopped raining, so the surface should become
somewhat dryer by the time the hill climb is over.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.520
I hope Ikeda's race drags
on for as long as possible.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.400
The drier the surface gets,
the easier it is for me to race.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.300
It looks like Ikeda chose to be the lead.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.300
But why did he do that
under these conditions?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:05.380
Both Kobayakawa of 246 and Minagawa
of Katagiri were defeated as the chaser.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.700
Maybe he's trying to break that jinx.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:15.510
Generally speaking, the lead driver will feel
enormous pressure at the beginning of a wet race.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:20.200
The driver has to build his pace while
trying to figure out the road conditions.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.000
It's the same for a street race.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.900
Spiral's Zero has strong mettle.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.230
People think we, team Spiral,
are focused on tuning cars.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:43.440
It's true that we're picky about tuning, but
it's not like we spend our money aimlessly.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.660
It's Spiral's style to focus on
the approach of modification.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:54.110
We build cars with clear objectives, as if
the car demands a particular driving style.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.910
That's the basics of Zero theory.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.900
The human mind is weak

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.450
because of emotions.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.900
Emotions hinder sound judgment and precise control.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.300
For example, this rainy condition.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:27.020
It causes frustration by not being able to step on the
gas, as well as anxiety and fear of the slippery road.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:32.350
Those human emotions will lead to a mistake.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.550
So you have to empty your mind
and listen to the voice of your car.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.450
Zero theory begins by
interacting with your car.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.000
He's not just skilled, he's amazing.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.880
He's so stable on this wet surface.
Is he trying not to skid the tires?

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.790
But that doesn't mean he's driving slow.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.200
As proof of that, in just trying to keep up,
I'm almost losing control of my car.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.960
Does that mean he doesn't have
any wasteful accelerator work?

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.030
His lack of eagerness is eerie.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.900
The younger Takahashi is facing a wall

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.800
but there's plenty of time to
see how he tries to fight Zero.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.550
A well tuned car has its own soul

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.820
so the driver should be modest.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.250
Instead of trying to manage the car

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.170
make yourself part of the car
and drive as the car wishes.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:48.310
Emotions like anger, anxiousness,
and haste will cause a negative result.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.100
Even fighting spirit is unnecessary for Zero driving.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.700
What is Zero theory exactly?

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.700
It sounds really ambiguous and
I don't even know if I get it or not.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:10.390
My interpretation is that it's a
theory of prioritizing fewer mistakes.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.200
Instead of letting drivers do as they like

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.960
assume cars have wills of their own,
and let the drivers follow them.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.800
That's the part I'm not sure about.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:32.720
To put it in extreme terms, they assume an emotionless
computer controlled car as an ideal example

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.700
then they try to suppress the
driver's consciousness and emotion.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.200
Such an approach isn't wrong.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.800
Mistakes are always
caused by human emotions.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.200
I agree with the idea of focusing
on the interaction with the car

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.450
like the relationship between
Fujiwara and his Eight-Six.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:00.410
A driver's skills are determined by the amount
and accuracy of information he receives.

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:06.200
Especially with wet road conditions like this,
the information from the tires is crucial.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.930
So our opponent has no weakness? Is there
any way we can break through his defenses?

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.960
There is.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.860
It's impossible for a human to
completely control his emotions.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.000
I won't be fooled.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
In Zero theory even fighting spirit is
regarded as unnecessary, but that's not true.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.000
Very safe and stable.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.000
I don't like that type.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.330
He's an incredible technician since he's
picking up the pace under these conditions.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.330
There's something absolutely
necessary for a driver to drive fast.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.650
The key word between Keisuke and I is

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.960
fighting spirit.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:11.000
Yesterday, you mentioned a worse condition
than the rain, and now it's become real.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.900
Hakone's infamous

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.510
white demon.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.720
Fog?!

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:40.100
According to the guys near the peak,
it's getting thicker and thicker.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.900
This's ridiculous.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.400
We're in the middle of a hill climb race.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.700
This's horrible.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.500
If this was the Fuji Speedway, the race would
be immediately terminated with a red flag.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.200
We can only hope the fog
doesn't get any thicker.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.100
So long as he has good enough visibility

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.000
a seasoned driver like Ikeda
should be able to manage.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:10.740
But our race marshals scattered throughout the
course will be useless because you can't see them.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.100
That can't be helped.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:18.540
In any case, no driver can
maintain their pace in the fog.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.500
You anticipated this fog?

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:29.230
I knew this weekend's weather would be bad.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:36.620
Before coming to Hakone, I gathered as much historical
data as possible about the relationship between rain and fog.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.020
I see.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:43.320
I predicted that this fog was highly probable.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.780
I told Keisuke about it beforehand.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.960
We took this fog into account
when we planned our strategy.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.550
You're just amazing.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.200
Normally people wouldn't notice that.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.080
But, Ryosuke, this poor visibility
affects both drivers equally.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.360
If that's the case, don't you think
the local driver has an advantage?

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.590
I don't know about that.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.960
Fog...

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.350
That's scary.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.400
They popped out and disappeared into the fog.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.370
They're both out of their minds. How can
they keep their foot on the pedal in this fog?

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:51.800
This area's most notable feature is the
famous Fuji Speedway in their territory.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.500
There's no doubt it's helping
the locals improve their skills.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.840
This is it. The situation is developing
just like my brother predicted.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.850
My chance to attack will come sooner than expected.
I won't miss this window of opportunity.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:18.950
Naturally, their cars and driving
styles are biased toward the circuit.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.850
Probably so.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.730
I felt that strongly when
I read Ikeda's Zero theory.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:30.960
His idea is suitable for a closed circuit, an
environment designed to be used for safe driving.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.400
It's a superb theory that you can
apply to mountain passes, but

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.000
it doesn't take uncertainties into account.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.500
Now I must admit that my choice of taking
the lead for the first run was wrong.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.870
But the battle is still on. I want to keep
the drop in my pace to a minimum.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.210
It's obvious that I'm getting upset.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.100
Interaction with the car
is the basic of Zero theory.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.540
But no matter how well I do it,
I can't break free from this situation.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.190
Even I'm scared of this poor visibility.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.150
But it will wear out the lead more.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.440
There's one clear difference from earlier.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.800
I couldn't see any sign of emotion before,
but now I do on the rear of Zero's car.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.400
My theory of fastest street driving is even dirtier.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:46.730
I've been making Keisuke practice a type of
blind training inspired by Fujiwara's blind attack.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.620
Really?

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.300
It wasn't really meant for fog.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.500
But our solution to temporary low visibility
at night in the rain will come in handy.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:01.900
Listen, Sakamoto, if you feel fear,
ease up on the gas pedal.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.600
It's the basics of the Zero mindset.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.100
When we're petrified with fear,
we tend to panic.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.850
If you feel fear, you've
already made a mistake.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.150
When it happens, release the gas
pedal, and calm yourself down.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.700
You're risking your life if you
drive with fear. Don't forget that.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.150
From here on, it's a fight against fear.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.510
Extra emotions will dictate your driving style.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.200
What's this uncomfortable feeling?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.740
A part of me is telling me
to ease up on the throttle.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.100
But another self is refusing,
keeping my foot on the pedal.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.750
That contradiction is causing stress.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.700
But I can't lose.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.600
What I need now is focus and

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.760
a strong desire to win.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.100
It's that fighting spirit

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.430
which I normally deny.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.200
Project D consists of pure street attackers.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.400
Whether it's fog or whatever, we'll
do what we need to in order to win.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.650
His line is different.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.060
Clearly different from
earlier in the battle.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.020
I can't believe this. Am I not
racing with the mindset of Zero?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.000
I can tell from his line that he's
concerned about oncoming traffic.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.000
In this visibility, there's no way
you can avoid an oncoming car.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.830
He must have arranged a number of
course marshals at the blind corners.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.270
But now they're useless because of this fog.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.060
Brother's prediction was dead on.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.990
Not yet

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.700
This place should do it.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.500
This is where the average speed suddenly
increases after a series of slow sections.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.900
If the fog forms as
my brother predicted

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.490
anyone would hesitate to step on the
gas no matter how strong minded he is.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:27.940
The idea is to pick an overtake location and
practice repeatedly until you can visualize it.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.650
I don't know how thick the fog will become

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.940
but I've practiced until I could
trace the line with my eyes closed.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.050
Your role during the actual race is important.
I'm counting on you, Kenta.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:55.250
Keisuke went back and forth on this
section with his eyes open and closed.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.000
That was how he trained to avoid
dropping his pace in poor visibility.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.350
Is it okay to believe that the
heavens are on Keisuke's side?

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.740
Wasn't fog this thick within his expectations?

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:14.840
Passing in this fog sounds so suitable for
the bold Keisuke, but it's too dangerous.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.710
Their exhaust sounds are close.
He'll reach the planned location soon.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.190
But what's more important
is any sound from behind.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.860
I have a great responsibility.
For Keisuke sake, I can't make a mistake.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:53.410
Isn't that incredible, Shin?
Spiral's Ikeda drives so fast in this fog.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.500
I don't know about that.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.500
The lower car in the rear
seemed more amazing.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.890
It looked like a yellow fireball to me, Mom.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.270
We'll leave the woods and reach a hilly area soon.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.650
Once the fog gets thinner, I should
be able to see the right lane clearer.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.030
Then I'll be able to let out my frustration

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.000
at full throttle.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.930
Fog?!

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.900
I can't see anything...

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.400
A white void!

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.900
Incoming call

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.430
which means no oncoming
traffic in the target area.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.360
Nice Kenta. Perfect timing.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.650
This is scary.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:10.210
No matter how strongly my brain commands
me to do it, my intuition is firmly refusing it.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
