Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.450
This is reality.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.530
The pace has definitely increased.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.670
Can't I become childish enough?

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.200
Can't I push myself recklessly?

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.950
Trying not to make any mistakes
while conserving my tires.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.260
Is that kind of calculating
making me drive like an old man?

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.800
Ridiculous.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.410
I race with the faith that I'm the fastest out there.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.090
He hit the guard rail!

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.000
What's happening?

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.810
A real racing driver is seriously 
attacking an amateur Eight-Six driver!

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.960
What the hell? That's impossible.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.280
Cleared the corner!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.700
Pros are amazing, after all. That was my limit.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.000
I couldn't have turned any faster.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.530
So a traditional racing strategy 
puts me at a disadvantage.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.070
Fujiwara is being pushed hard.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.170
The final stage is near.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.630
I've got to become childish
in order to win this battle.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.350
Act 5  [ Fujiwara Zone ]

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.190
Hey, Fujiwara, how much longer are you going
to make your son play such a meaningless game?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.350
Look who's talking.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.770
You used to be a wild street
racer when you were young.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.600
Times have changed.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.220
It's meaningless unless you drive on the circuit.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.960
No matter how much practice he gains in mountain
passes, he won't advance past a certain level.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.000
Your son is talented.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm telling you this because 
I don't want you to waste it.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.660
This is tough.
I feel like he's cornered.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:42.360
No, he's grown a lot more
than you realize, Fumihiro.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.350
Is that so?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.650
Since he's the leader, our strategy
is to finish the race on the first run.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.100
I already gave detailed
instructions to Fujiwara yesterday.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.640
The actual trick lies ahead.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.020
There's no way he's lost
his concentration yet.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.150
I don't understand what you mean by
growing out of the mountain passes or not.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.000
Then I can affirm to you that my 
son will definitely win this time.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.450
Let me tell you, nothing can
be that certain in a competition.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.600
Ryosuke's prediction was dead on.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.840
I've got to focus.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.590
It's risky, but I've gotta try this.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.000
His unlimited vehicle control skills
are the best part of the Fujiwara Zone.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.800
When he drives the Eight-Six, he creates
a situation that even a pro can't surpass.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.150
That's the idea behind our trap, but I'm
sure our opponent has already figured it out.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.770
Does that mean our strategy will fail?

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.900
No, it doesn't.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.100
Do you think a pro would run
away from a clash of skills?

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.450
His pride will make him
face the challenge head on.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.300
At the very least, today's opponent is that type.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.450
I approved this strategy because
I thought an honest and fair person

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.770
who chooses their position with a coin
toss, will knowingly fall into our trap.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.550
On top of that, they're 
racing on a mountain pass.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.400
My son is a master of it.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.650
The goal is close.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.770
It's going to be an over the limit braking 
match at the entrance of the next corner.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.230
This is what mountain
 pass racing is all about.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.380
If you can clear the corner at that speed,
I should be able to, as well.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.270
I'll take your challenge!

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.050
The combined performance
of Fujiwara and the Eight-Six

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.900
can make them clear a corner at a
speed that pros would think impossible.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.000
Such things happen in reality.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.840
It's all part of the Fujiwara Zone.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.800
Same speed, same line.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.360
Plus, my car's MR layout has
a higher limit than an FR's!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.700
This can't be happening!

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.900
I lost.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.600
Anything I say will sound like an excuse.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.650
My car's got a mid engine and rear wing.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.570
I thought I couldn't
lose during full braking.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.140
Pros are trained to control their car a
half step before such a situation occurs.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.290
But you kept controlling your car
until the end, while I chickened out.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.700
The spin was caused by me backing away.
That's what I regret the most.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:24.150
If I had kept going, I don't know whether 
I would have cleared the corner or hit a tree.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.380
My fighting spirit was defeated
by the fear of going off the course.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.700
At the same time, 
I was defeated by you.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.550
I was going to invite you to
the world of circuit racing

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.470
but I've changed my mind after racing you.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.340
Your peculiar driving sense won't
have much use in my world.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.000
I just feel like it'd be a waste.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.510
Be the best in your field.
You'll become one of a kind.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.190
That's my advice to you.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.980
Thank you.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.880
Oh, hold on.
A victory report has come.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.390
Hello, it's me.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.450
What the?!
 That's impossible!

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.470
So Takumi won, huh?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.890
It couldn't have happened, dammit!

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.550
It's only a game of playing
tag in a mountain pass.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.780
I don't need your comforting words! 
You can't understand my frustration!

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:37.800
I'm Minagawa.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.700
I'm Takahashi Keisuke.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:46.000
I've heard that you're fast,
with consecutive wins against 4WD cars.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.200
If you can shake me off, 
you are indeed something.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.000
Let me see your proud sprint dash.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.230
Are you telling me to be the lead?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.550
Alright, but do you think
you can keep up with me?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.550
Shut the hell up.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.360
Listen, Kenta

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.310
Yes?

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:13.150
This battle has a special meaning to me.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:14.220
Do you understand?

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.700
I do.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.400
Watch me.
I'll win no matter what.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.650
I wonder how Takumi's race went.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.290
He should give us a call.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.650
He's dense when it 
comes to things like this.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.010
He doesn't understand our concern.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.010
Yeah, but it's pointless to get frustrated.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:41.070
Not just Takumi, Takahashi Keisuke's
going up against a pro racer too, right?

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.200
Right. Neither Takumi nor Takahashi 
Keisuke can let their guard down.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.830
Geez, I'm so pumped up!

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.560
Five seconds till start!

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.720
Three

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.820
Two

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.030
One

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.120
Go!

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.200
Why do I feel so irritated,
or is it more like vicious?

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.700
I want a complete victory over you.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.300
I know what Keisuke means by special.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.500
It's because his opponent today is a pro.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:38.890
He's trying to test his skills against a pro.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:48.550
No matter how many amateur 
4WD drivers you've defeated

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.800
amateurs can't use the
full potential of their cars.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.200
If I dash when the tires
are in their best condition,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.400
I should be able to overtake
you even with my heavy 80 Supra.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:06.060
The battle between rear wheel drive cars boils
down to the game of conserving the rear tires.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.120
You can't attain real tire management skills 
unless you take part in professional racing.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.780
You'll wear out your rear tires
by trying too hard in the first run.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.270
Then the proud speed brat of the
 mountain passes will be finished.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.090
Hey, do you remember

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.170
the second round of the battle
against the Todo School in Tochigi?

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.650
In that complex stage
of uphill and downhill

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:58.910
everyone thought you'd choose Keisuke's FD
against the racing driver, Tachi Tomoyuki.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.070
But you chose Fujiwara's Eight-Six.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.790
Your explanation was so 
sensational that I couldn't forget.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.810
You said you're using two approaches in your 
pursuit of the fastest record in street racing.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.260
That's why there are two drivers in Project D.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.500
Oh, that.
I'm amazed you remember that.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.120
Of course I did.
It sounded so meaningful.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.170
Fujiwara is a peculiar type, who
specializes in mountain passes.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.790
And I think he's become
exactly as you described.

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:42.050
On the other hand, Keisuke is a traditional type,
who adapts racing techniques to the street.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:48.850
You chose Fujiwara because we wouldn't have stood
a chance against a pro in a clash of traditional skills.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.200
I did say that.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.700
Then what'll happen during today's battle?

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.000
Today's opponent has top level traditional skills.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:10.300
The Eight-Six kid won the downhill battle,
but I wonder how the hill climb round will develop.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.050
This time I want to 
hear your prediction, Hojo.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:20.030
Minagawa is a proud person, so he
doesn't think he can lose to an amateur.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.900
But the younger Takahashi is a
better driver than Minagawa thinks.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.060
He's well trained, especially his acceleration work.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:34.690
That's why that FD's been undefeated so far.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:35.980
I see.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.880
Plus, he's backed by Ryosuke.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:45.830
I don't think he'd send his brother
into a race without a strategy.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.350
I feel the same way.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:53.570
This battle will be tangled up. It's a big 
mistake to think Minagawa will win easily.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.760
Whose side are you on, Hojo?

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.040
What happened between you and
our opponent's leader in the past?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.090
There's nothing important
between Ryosuke and I.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.910
It's my older brother who has a
bitter connection to Ryosuke.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.950
The driver who's nicknamed the Grim Reaper?

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.440
The FD is the lead? Minagawa
must have chosen to be the chaser.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.440
Their positions in the first round will be the key to the outcome of this race.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.700
As expected, he's got more horsepower.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:46.550
But that doesn't mean much in this battle.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.550
Both of us are well aware of that.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:59.960
Indeed, our opponent is a
top class traditional driver.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.460
With competition trained skills,
he won't show any weakness.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:09.790
The sense of shaving time off, 
mental ease at the limit, and stamina.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:15.100
Those things can't be 
attained by street racers.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.080
It'd be the right strategy for us to throw
a change up, instead of a fast ball

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.460
but we don't have that kind of choice with Keisuke.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.200
So I've sent Keisuke out with confidence

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.410
because Keisuke has grown.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.930
Special menu? Like a boot camp?

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.700
Right.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:50.290
It will be extremely difficult to continue defeating 
powerful 4WD cars with your rear wheel drive FD3S.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:55.250
The key is how effectively
you use the rear tires.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.000
This training is for that.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.100
Just five round trips
a day should be fine.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:05.590
Try to match the times I've set for the
ten laps of uphill and downhill driving.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.250
Write every time down in this notebook,
and show it to me every day.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:19.100
If there's a noticeable gap between my preset time and
your actual time, try to figure out why, and report in detail.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.440
That's all.

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:28.180
Fine by me, but these times are quite
a bit slower than Akagi's best record.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.350
Don't you think this is too easy?

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.790
I didn't say you have to surpass those times.
It's not good to be faster or slower.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.910
What?

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:42.200
Whether it's uphill or downhill,
in rain, or behind a slower car

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.650
you must aim for one fixed time.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.900
If you think it's easy, 
you're seriously mistaken.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.850
You'll know how hard it is soon enough.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.610
If you're frustrated that you weren't chosen for
the race against Tachi Tomoyuki in Tochigi

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.710
complete this menu every day until fall.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.490
That's an absolute necessity for you to
continue winning until the Kanagawa races.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:22.550
I see. I didn't know Keisuke had
to put in that kind of training.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.400
So the second race against Todo
School must have made you do that.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.510
But what's the meaning 
behind the special training?

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:35.050
That training was slightly modified for Keisuke

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.760
but it's basically the same menu
 I used when I was younger.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.900
The same menu?

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:49.680
If you drive blindly at full throttle, you'll only put 
stress on the car, and your skills won't improve.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:55.200
Drive at the limit over and over, and 
your times will eventually even out.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:02.000
It's more difficult to get a set time while holding back,
because your times can easily be faster or slower.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.830
Just flooring the gas pedal won't work.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:11.400
You must learn the technique of
controlling the throttle precisely.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:16.170
That's not all.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:23.910
In rain, you have to be creative in setting the pace for
the constantly changing friction coefficient of the surface.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.000
It's difficult to cope with the situation 
when you get stuck behind a slow car.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:35.750
Suppose you lost 4 seconds until the overtake
point, you must recover exactly 4 seconds.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.700
And you do that with the internal clock in
your body, instead of relying on a stopwatch.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.050
Is that possible?

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:50.060
Not right away, but you'll be able to,
depending on how you train yourself.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.980
That's the traditional way of driving practice.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:20:00.510
You attain an abundance of information
through repetitious simple training.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.800
And then your internal sensor 
will become sensitive to time.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.030
I've gotta control the gas pedal 
depression in a number of small steps.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:17.400
It's much harder to control your desired 
speed than trying to drive as fast as possible.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:32.050
The great thing about Keisuke is that once he sets his
mind to it, he'll finish a task without any compromise.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.870
He drives every day,
except for Project D's race days.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.560
Every day?!

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:44.650
As the gap between the desired
and actual times narrowed

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:50.300
he began to understand what 
made his time too fast or too slow.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.690
The daily report made him create 
a habit of analyzing things rationally

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:01.380
which added a logical foundation
to his intuitive driving style.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:09.450
He must be aware of an unexpected
side effect of the training, as well.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:22.400
Brother told me the special training
was for my accelerator work.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.000
But that's not exactly true.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:31.190
There's something else I need, in order to
continue winning in this tough Kanagawa area.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.730
Watch me, Brother.
I've come to realize what it is.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.640
Remember our first battle in Kanagawa, Fumihiro?

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.830
The Lan Evo of Team 246? 
Keisuke accelerated in the mid section and won.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:52.000
His tire management in the
second half was splendid

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.200
but I'm more interested in his
refined acceleration when needed.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.000
Speed is what I meant by a side effect.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.500
Tire management skills specialized for
mountain passes, and sense of time.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:16.270
The real reason I made Keisuke train that way was
to make him attain those two skills at a high level.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:25.100
Strangely enough, the menu
was designed to slow him down

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.200
but it helped him drive
a lot faster in the end.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.280
And today's strategy is to make
the best use of that side effect.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:44.000
In other words, Keisuke will engage in a head to
head fight against a racing driver in a sprint battle?

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:48.030
I won't let Fujiwara steal the show.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.990
I'll build the legend of Project D,
the best of the Kanto area.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.040
Not too shabby.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.770
He's trying to catch me off guard by altering
the throttle opening at the exit of every corner.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:18.870
Opening the throttle randomly between 85-90%, he's
gauging vehicle distance to decide when to accelerate.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:29.340
I didn't expect him to pull off such a trick. 
He's much better than I thought.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.700
The first half of the hill climb battle is almost over.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.500
What did you think of our 
opponent this time around?

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.000
What's your actual impression?

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:48.300
When it comes to speed,
race car drivers are really fast.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.590
In my race, I was able to pull away once.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:59.800
I put on a spurt at 100%, believing that
I must outrun my opponent from there

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.440
but I was caught, and felt pressured.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.220
I panic when I lose
in speed at a critical moment.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.390
I understand that.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.060
But Keisuke is different from me.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.580
How do I put it?

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.900
Keisuke has an aura

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.250
which makes me glad that he's on my side,
because I don't want to race against him.

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:32.860
There are many fast drivers, but
I believe it'd be tough to fight Keisuke.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.410
It's begun.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:58.770
I'm counting on you, Keisuke.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.660
Without two genius drivers on my team, it'll be
impossible to sweep all the races in Kanagawa.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.720
And Project D won't be complete.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
