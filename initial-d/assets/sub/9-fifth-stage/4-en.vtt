Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.670
I see. No wonder the left rear felt light.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.550
I couldn't maintain grip in the left corner,
and massively over steered.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.870
Omiya

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.100
It can't be helped.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.590
Luck is a part of the game, and I couldn't
have been more motivated today.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.400
I've come to realize that the root of 
my driving lies in the mountain passes.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.000
You can't experience the sensation
of your head going blank on the circuit.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.520
I'm happy that I could fight a real battle,
because it doesn't happen very often in life.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.040
Man, I didn't expect Omiya
to lose to that Eight-Six kid.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.000
He's quite mysterious.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.400
Too bad he didn't go for a time trial.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.200
By learning his actual time, we could
have analyzed his car's fighting potential

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.490
and figured out the kid's driving skills.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.800
Our opponent isn't stupid.
Don't underestimate Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.970
Contact the guys scattered along
the course. We're heading home.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.890
Did you hear who won, Kogashiwa?

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.650
Of course I did.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.680
We should be happy,
because we get our chance.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.820
I guess you can say that.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.970
I have to pay back
Fujiwara Takumi of Project D.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.330
In Kanagawa, I'll get revenge for
my humiliation on the Iroha Slopes.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.940
Act 4  [ Fated Revenge Battle ]

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.540
We've been waiting for you!

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.660
Here comes the Ace!

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.850
Well... ummm...

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:03.150
Well then, let me, reporter Itsuki, interview Project D's 
Fujiwara Takumi, who won his first battle in Kanagawa.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.900
Hey, I don't like that kind of thing.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.220
Well, Mr. Fujiwara,
tell us what's on your mind.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.210
A full tank of high octane gas for cash.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.650
You moron! So boring!

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.800
How can you keep your
tension so low all the time?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.910
But I just came here for gas.
It can't be helped.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.960
Geez, are you ready for the next battle?

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
Takumi, when is the second match in Kanagawa?

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.610
The week after next.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.060
We've decided to have 
an interval between each race.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.610
That means you can
relax a bit next weekend.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.680
More or less.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.900
It's a little far, but we've
got to see Project D

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.060
I mean Takumi race at least once.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.150
Good idea. If we can, I want to stay overnight so
we can watch their practice the day before the race.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.500
We can visit Hakone's tourist spots and
go to a hot spring during the day time.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.200
Hot spring, you said, Iketani?!
Bathing in a unisex hot spring?!

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.550
Not all hot springs are unisex.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.900
That's every man's dream. Just a dream.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.250
Ummm...

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.350
If you're coming, the sooner the better. 
If we lose, there'll be no other chance.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.360
Hey, don't jinx yourself.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.900
Make sure you keep winning.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.680
Geez

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.760
Hello, this is Matsumoto.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.000
What's the matter, Ryosuke?

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.940
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.570
I'll do anything. Do you want a
super charger in the Eight-Six?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.060
No, that's not it.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.200
What, the FC?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.900
Yeah.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.590
But why your car?

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.850
I can't tell you yet, but
something is bothering me.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:00.000
I see.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.440
This is a separate matter from Project D,
so keep this between us for now.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.610
I'm counting on you.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.040
Okay.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:19.550
He will eventually show up, so long as
Hojo Gou is with the Sidewinder team.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.070
I'm sure of it.
It's an unavoidable fate.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.200
I can't run away from it.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.580
Not because I'm the leader of Project D, but 
because I'm a street racer, Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.770
Maybe it's time to put an end to

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.080
Kaori

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.310
What? You're off next weekend?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.650
Yeah, sort of.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.250
Really? For sure?

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.090
Then let's go to the beach, the beach!

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.510
But no overnight stay,
not even coming home late.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.150
That's fine. We just have to
leave early in the morning.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.090
You're so right. So we can go
to the beach for real then?

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.120
The beach... I haven't been
to one for a long time.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.390
I bet there are tons of hot gals there.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.690
I want to see gals in bathing suits.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.400
Nobody says "gal" any more.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.930
I've been bothered by something for a long time.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.700
Like there was a time when it was perfectly
okay for school girls to walk around the city

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.000
wearing a uniform with a mini skirt
that kept flashing their panties.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.030
Yes, there was.
Actually, some still do even today.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.970
If you think about it,
that's really abnormal.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.860
Even if they're ugly or have thick legs, 
their skirts are way too revealing.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.100
On top of that, nobody thought it was strange.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.690
It must be some sort of mass hysteria.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.080
I guess you have a point.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.470
The same thing happens at the 
pool or on the beach in summer.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.350
Personally, girls in bathing
suits are erotic and sexy.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.000
Oh, really?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:24.500
Besides that, how come these creatures called women
aren't embarrassed looking like that in broad daylight?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.670
Well, maybe because
everyone else does the same.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:32.610
They're only supposed to appear like that to
a special someone in a dark private room!

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.550
I feel the same way, Iketani!

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.350
You do understand, huh?

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.250
In short, they're just jealous.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.300
Maybe I should become a priest. 
I hate this erotic world.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.000
You're right.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.160
I'm sorry.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.730
I always ask you to come to Saitama.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.360
You don't have to worry about that.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.720
This's incredible for us. Before, we
only chatted at a family restaurant.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.000
But we've been together since this 
morning and come all the way here.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.750
Everything is a new record.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.440
Right. This almost feels unreal.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.060
Takumi looks pretty sharp these days.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.000
Yeah, you're right. 
He looks more manly.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.330
He used to wear a poker face,
or more like some emotionless kid.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.910
I think it's because of his confidence.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.580
He's fulfilling his duty
as an ace of Project D.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.700
He meets Takahashi Ryosuke's 
expectations and gets results.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.100
He did grow up.
There's no way we can do the same.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.140
It must be tough, but also very happy.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.360
About what?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.910
To be a member of Project D.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.900
I'm envious because he can maintain
the tension of aiming for one goal

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.200
by acting as part of a team
and joining forces with others.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.480
It's not something everyone can do.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.720
He shines so brightly to those
who spend their days aimlessly.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.400
That brat took my Imp
because the A/C works better.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.000
Thank you, Takumi. I still have
plenty of time before my curfew.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.980
Good thing we didn't get
caught in a traffic jam.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.050
Well then

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.260
Be careful on the way home, Takumi.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.290
You too, Mika-chan.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.000
Oh, Takumi, wait.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.700
Umm, you see

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.060
Can you just call me "Mika,"
instead of "Mika-chan"?

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.000
Go ahead.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.000
Mika.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.700
Nice.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.290
Call me that from now on. Bye.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.390
The balance is better than expected.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:59.660
Takahashi Ryosuke is quite a guy.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:04.280
I don't have the ability to refine the suspension
settings like this in such a short period of time.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.750
It can really go further with this

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.610
but probably not until the final step.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.980
It can't be helped.
I guess I have to be prepared.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.290
That'll be the last thing I can do for Takumi.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.360
Man, this is awesome.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.560
So it was a roll cage when you
said something about safety stuff.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.700
The mood is totally different.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.700
I feel strange. It's like
sitting inside a solid box.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.240
The pace of modification seems faster lately.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.700
I can tell that the Project D factory is devoted to the races in Kanagawa.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.120
Finally, the second race in Kanagawa.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.600
So where is it going to be held, Takumi?

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.770
Oh, I heard it's going to be Hakone.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.980
Better!

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.960
Right on. Your adjustment
perfectly matches this course.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.290
I can't lose to amateurs.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:39.300
That said, Racing Team Katagiri's main
battlefield is the circuit, not the public roads.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:45.240
Don't worry. It's impossible
to find a reason for me to lose.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.580
I'll put an end to the glory
of Fujiwara Takumi, I mean...

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.960
of Akina's Eight-Six.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.120
Their strength lies more
or less in their immaturity.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.240
Immaturity, huh?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:09.870
Yes. If you drive on the circuit, you get used to safety, and grow fearful of mountain passes.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:16.960
It's natural because there are no escape zones, 
and you don't know what's beyond the blind corner.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.910
It's not a game for rational adults to play.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.250
That's exactly what
I want to tell you, Kogashiwa.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.440
Even though you know that, you're
still going to fight this ridiculous battle.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.900
That means I'm still 
immature to a certain extent.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.400
This is my graduation ceremony.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.750
I'll probably be scared of 
mountain passes in a year or so.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:04.670
But I can still engage in a reckless battle because my
sense of mountain pass driving hasn't gone numb.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.710
I want to get revenge on that guy,
and graduate from the mountain pass.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.100
Driving skills aren't important.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.100
What matters is how 
immature you can become.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:24.500
I didn't notice this in the dark 
at night, but Mt. Fuji looks so huge.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.790
Is it bigger than Akagi?

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.760
Are you stupid? Fuji is the
biggest mountain in Japan.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:37.190
That's right. Anyway, it makes me 
realize that we are indeed in Hakone.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.550
Hey guys, we didn't come
here for a school trip.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.050
Eat breakfast now.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:44.540
Okay!

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.260
Hey, Fumihiro, you sound
like a teacher on a field trip.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.400
There they are. That's Project D.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.730
Hello, this is Fujiwara Tofu

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.100
It's me.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.470
Kogashiwa

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.030
You always call me out of the blue.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.910
I'm ready, so let's get started.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.200
Well then, could you pick
your position for the first run?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.780
That's how we've been doing things.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.810
It doesn't matter to me.
How about letting a coin decide?

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.760
Heads is for the local, which is me, to be the lead, and tails is for you.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.100
Sure. That's fine.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.800
Good.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.150
Tails

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.060
It's decided. I'll be the chaser.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.120
Alright, let's begin!

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.090
A race against your son again?

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.550
Right. This time around,
he will definitely win.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.200
He's getting better than me

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.360
as he made his own decision to leave the public
road behind and entered the world of motor sports.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.870
It's not something anyone can do.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.610
His efforts brought him the chance.

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.360
Sounds wonderful.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:40.380
What about your son?
Can he surpass you?

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.350
I'm starting the countdown!

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.090
Five

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.000
Four

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.770
I'll get revenge for my loss on the Iroha Slopes.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.000
Three

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.550
Two

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:53.900
One

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.650
Go!

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.300
Alright, they're off!

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.950
Go, Kogashiwa!

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.230
Do you remember that MR-S driver, Kogashiwa?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:14.970
Of course. The guy who got pumped
up against the Emperor's Sudo, right?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.890
He drives a mid ship car very
well, thanks to his go kart skills.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.100
Who'd have thought he'd
show up in a place like this?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.000
Looks like this's going to
be another tough battle.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.710
Keisuke's opponent is also
an active racer, a real athlete.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:38.190
Right. Race car drivers
have a different sense of time.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.000
They know how to shave it off very well.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.300
If we were on a circuit,
our chances would be very slim

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.220
but the public roads are our stage, so
there's no need to flinch at our opponent's title.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.480
We'll be able to win if each of
us carries out our job perfectly.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.200
I didn't come here to lose a battle.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.320
The car's improved.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.270
No wonder it kept winning
in the northern Kanto area.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.160
But it's no longer mysterious to me.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.300
The turning ability is simply a matter of tire capacity and load balance

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.150
and acceleration is a balance
between power and weight.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:27.200
You may be able to fool others, but not me.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.740
If I don't make any mistakes, I can win.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:40.000
I'll watch your progress in this first run, and finish you off in the second.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.700
You divide this course into three 
sections to build an overall strategy.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.400
The upper section is wider for faster speed.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.360
The middle part is a super slow section with continuous tight corners.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.650
And the lower part is a middle speed section where you can
step on the gas even though the road is somewhat narrow.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.820
Although circuit racers would 
consider the entire course very slow.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.930
The range of speed is 
too low in mountain passes.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.810
If the average speed was faster,
I could have gained a clear advantage.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.390
But I won't use that as an excuse.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.650
The last section is the decisive point.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.500
If I were Fujiwara, I'd make my move there.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.250
Can he do that against a pro?

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:38.720
He has to. This is when he
has to show his true potential.

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.810
I have this eerie feeling.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.510
We might end up seeing it on this course.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.470
See it, you mean...

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.870
Oh no, I'm not really
good with those things.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.270
You idiot. 
I never said you'd see a ghost.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.520
Inner wheel lift? He's good.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.700
But I doubt such artistic control
actually contributes to his speed.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.070
Race car drivers don't play around.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.220
Faster or not, that's all that matters.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.100
My brother calls it the Fujiwara Zone

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.210
but it's not exactly the same 
as the ones used by top athletes.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.080
It's a phenomenon that only occurs
between Fujiwara and his Eight-Six.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.080
What kind of phenomenon is it?

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.880
It's difficult to explain,
except for my brother.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.200
I'm not so sure either.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:48.250
But when I drive behind Fujiwara during practice,
 there are moments that catch me off guard.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.000
He pulls away for some
reason that I can't explain.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.440
I thought it was like a mirage.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.720
You never know when you'll get to see it.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.300
But there's a Fujiwara Zone for sure.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.040
He shows it when a certain 
set of conditions are met.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.580
What's important is the 
unique rhythm of the course.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:14.470
What was that? My mistake?

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.000
I can't let my guard down.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.960
Remember, I lost to him once before.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.850
Again? He pulled away at the exit.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.170
Was it my mistake?
My strategy was not to make any.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.940
What bothers me most is that I'm upset.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.070
I might have gotten carried away by his pace.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.390
A point where his rhythm changes?

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:54.290
Yes. From a rhythmic repetition of stepping
on the gas, then releasing it right away

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:56.720
to a rhythm of delaying the release a bit.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.210
The two cars are right at that point.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:02.910
That's where something might happen.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.250
Something? What is it?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.250
The peak of the Fujiwara Zone.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.700
I've always wanted to ask you.
What exactly is it?

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.550
He didn't just start showing it recently,
he did it a long time ago.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.000
When I raced against him on 
Akina, I caught a glimpse of it.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.000
I feel like it was refined after
he raced against Purple Shadow.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:37.000
Simply put, it's his level 
of training in the Eight-Six.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.910
When it comes to Fujiwara, his level
is beyond our normal imagination.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.140
It must be the result of his
abnormal practice environment.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.100
You said he heard the voice of the
Eight-Six during the previous battle.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.250
In the auto industry, they often use the phrase, "The driver and the car as one"

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:01.200
but in reality, no one can handle
one ton of metal as if it were their limbs.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:07.500
But something like that happens
between Fujiwara and his Eight-Six.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.100
He can use the best part of the tires just
when they begin to skid whenever he wants.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:19.200
He can also freely switch between the
side for turning and the slide for acceleration.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:25.800
As a result, what happens is that 
the Eight-Six accelerates like a 4WD.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.650
No way, that's not possible.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.770
Of course it's not.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.940
The Eight-Six is still a rear wheel drive car.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.100
What I mean is that the Eight-Six maneuvers
so sharply that it creates such an illusion.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.450
It's a huge shock to see it from behind,
especially to those who know what I mean.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.650
Even if you enter a corner the same way,
he points his car to the exit a moment quicker

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.560
then he steps on the gas with zero
steering angle to accelerate earlier.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:02.220
There is a moment when his driving style perfectly
matches the peaky characteristics of the car.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.220
I can't completely explain it.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.760
There are things even you can't explain?

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.200
There are.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.050
Especially things like the performance
of Fujiwara and his Eight-Six

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.880
can't be explained by any theory.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
