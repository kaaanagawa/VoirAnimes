Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.310
Has it begun?

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.650
I don't know why,
but I've got goose bumps.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.210
The Supra is a grand touring car, after all.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.550
Generally speaking, it gives
off a race oriented feel

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.140
but its design approach is different
from a hardcore sports car like the FD.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.300
Its weakness is its weight.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.920
What you're trying to say is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.330
when the FD and the Supra go head to head 
in a mountain pass, the Supra will be inadequate.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:29.830
So if the drivers skills are very close, it's 
possible for an amateur to embarrass a pro.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.650
That's the highlight of this battle.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.000
He isn't falling behind, but
isn't gaining on me either.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.620
I don't like that.
It really pisses me off.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.900
Act 6  [ Keisuke's Pride ]

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.000
Their pace is much faster than expected.
I didn't expect them to be that fast.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.000
Since the race so far has
 been a high speed match

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.750
the physical condition of the
 tires will determine the outcome.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.000
The driver of the lead 
FD must feel pressured

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.180
but Minagawa is the one
 who's actually hard pressed.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.300
I don't think he expected
the pace to be this fast.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.200
The current deadlock must be Minagawa's
psychological attack for turning the situation around.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.300
At the same time, it's the
last card Minagawa can deal.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.000
Dammit.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.550
Victory hinges on whether the
lead driver can endure it or not.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.380
It's not my imagination,
he's slowly gaining on me.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.490
The advantage I created
is narrowing bit by bit.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.260
The guy behind me is
pretty frightening, Brother.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.430
I feel like he's got one 
more gear left to use.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.740
Race car drivers are so incredible
 and scary, that they give me the chills.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.000
I'm counting on you, FD.
Your remaining strength is all I've got.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.370
The goal is so close.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.260
Don't get in a hurry, Keisuke.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.930
Your opponent will put
incredible pressure on you.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.500
Emotions mess up one's driving,
which can easily reverse the situation.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.020
Believe in your car, and
the experience you've gained.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.140
Show the proof of your growth.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.200
Step on the gas harder.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.310
What's wrong? Push harder.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.660
Try to get away... more desperately.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.000
Harder! Try harder to pull away!

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.440
Do it!

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.650
If you don't

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.450
I'll lose this battle.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.500
I used up all the potential of my tires.
I can't fight another round.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:10.790
The FD's superbly balanced lightweight body
 and front mid engine can reduce its tire wear.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.050
That'll decide the winner and loser.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.750
Knowing that, Minagawa still put up a fight for his
pride as a man who lives in the world of speed.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.680
The high speed race that resulted broke
the course record by a big margin.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.580
Brother, pros are really incredible.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.670
You just realized something so obvious?

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.290
More or less.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.000
I have mixed feelings of joy and frustration.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.250
I'm satisfied with myself for racing so well.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.400
I've done everything I can for now.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.730
But I can't explain how I lost
my advantage right near the end.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.760
At least, I did my best to pull away,
and I was able to manage that pace.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.600
Both of us were struggling with worn tires, so
how did he pick up the pace in that situation?

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.100
I was scared to death.
Do you know why, Brother?

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.800
Your opponent was a pro.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.920
Racing drivers know everything
about speed at the limit.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:32.440
Each driver has his own unique
technique they've learned from experience.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.110
They know how to raise the bar even 
higher when the situation calls for it.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.850
Every driver is different, so I
can't explain what Minagawa did

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.650
but it probably has more
to do with his spirit than skills.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.550
That's the territory of pros.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.720
For now, you only need to
remember that it can happen.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.650
Alright, let's head back to Gunma.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.200
Kenta!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.940
You drive car #2.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.590
Alright! Let's get going!

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.490
Sheesh, I can't drive the way I imagined.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.650
The tires are wearing 
out differently lately.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.000
You must be trying something new.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.100
Yeah.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.900
I tried to copy this thing called one hand 
steering that I saw in a battle the other day.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900
That must be it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.810
What's that?

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.000
You only steer with the right hand, 
with your left hand on the gearshift.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.600
I had a race called a 
duct tape death match last year

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.150
and the technique seems similar.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.100
It's easy to do that with the Imp (Suby),
because it's got power steering and 4WD

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.350
so it's stable, and the 
counter steering is minimized.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.230
Sounds impressive for coming out of
 your mouth. The practice is actually useful.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.900
You might be able to cut down the waste.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.420
You think so? I don't know
 how that'd work, though.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.060
If you can do the same with
the Eight-Six, that'll be great.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.300
That's hard.
I can't do that, for now.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.570
You hit the top. 
Your hands hurt, don't they?

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.070
N-not really.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.700
Such a bad liar.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.700
They must hurt.
 You just won't admit it.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.650
I haven't got a clean hit.
I didn't know it was so difficult.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.910
I'll take a break, so can
you demonstrate for me?

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.450
I guess I can.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.400
But this iron isn't mine, it's a rental, so...

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.390
Mika is incredible.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.400
I can tell, even if I don't
know anything about golf.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.340
I saw the aura of a top class player.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.100
Takumi isn't answering his phone.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.000
I have a hunch that he's with Mika.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.350
He chose a girl over his best friend?

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.000
It's unforgivable!

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.400
I'll punish him later.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.130
You thought he wouldn't?

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.020
In any case, Takumi and
Mika are suited to each other.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:42.400
Each has outstanding skills, so they 
must be mutually attracted, or sympathetic.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.400
It must be fate between a
dedicated and honest guy and girl.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.450
Speaking of which, 
I'm also dedicated and honest.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.390
In other words, 
talent makes the difference.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.400
Did you really have fun playing golf?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.300
I had a great time.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.000
Just watching your 
swing made me happy.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.800
Really?

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.630
I thought you were incredible. I can tell.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.000
Thank you.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.670
Although lately I've lost
my confidence at times.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.000
Oh, don't. 
Just believe in yourself.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.530
You'll become a top notch player.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.510
I hope so.
I want to become a pro.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.900
A-actually, I do, too.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.600
My goal is to become a pro.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.700
Really? 
That's awesome.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.470
Then we should compete

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.220
to see who makes their
dream come true first.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.000 line:50 %
Team Spiral

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.000 line:50 %
Leader - Ikeda Ryuji (Zero)

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.500 line:50 %
Team Spiral

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.500 line:50 %
Driver - Okuyama Hiroya (01)

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.500
So our turn has come, huh?

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.260
This's almost like a joke.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.800
246 was out of the question, but I thought 
Katagiri's drivers had a solid chance.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.650
They had too much pride, especially Minagawa.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.900
It can drag you down sometimes.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.800
You think you can win?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.240
Project D's Eight-Six is fast.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.400
I'll win. I guarantee it!

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.620
There aren't any regulations,
so we can do anything, right?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.500
If you try to compete in skills, you 
could trip over your own naivety.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.000
I had no intention of competing in
driving technique from the get go.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.300
I'll just try to win.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.700
You do understand.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.300
This summer agitation will be over soon.
Hakone will quiet down.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:26.970
As Okuyama said, Minagawa must have
lost because he tried to save face as a pro.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.400
There's no need for
conditions to be equal.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:36.060
We can beat our opponents
with superior vehicle potential.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.650
When did he get there?

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.260
I don't know what kind of idiot he is, 
but he's probably not one of the locals.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.410
The locals wouldn't pick
a fight with Spiral's Zero.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.400
I'll show you what I've got.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.870
It can keep up with my car's power?

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.810
Wow, what was that?

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.700
They were totally in battle mode.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:51.150
The red Z in front must be 
Spiral's Zero, but the rear?

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.000
It was so fast that I couldn't see.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:58.650
No, I know the car type 
from its distinctive tail lights.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.870
I have a bad feeling.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.280
You mean it's?

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.600
He isn't falling behind.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.210
It's amazing that he can
keep up with me at this pace.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.650
This guy's definitely no ordinary driver.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.740
He doesn't miss the braking zone.
That means he knows this course.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.190
If you're a local, who are you?

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.650
This is ridiculous.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.750
What the?!

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.850
God dammit!

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.800
That was so close.
Someone else would've ended up dead.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.190
As far as I know, there's only
one person who plays dirty like that.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.510
No doubt, he's come.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.450
Dark silver R32, the Grim Reaper GT-R.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.730
Apparently, the Grim Reaper has
been sighted a few times lately.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.000
So it seems.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:33.000
He left home long ago, so
I don't know what he's been doing.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.950
I'm not interested, either.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.800
But I can tell you one thing for sure.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.330
His true target is Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.370
So that's the "bitter fate"?

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:53.000
He lost his girlfriend two years ago, 
and he's been acting weird ever since.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.200
He withdrew to his room, quit his job, 
and stopped talking to the family.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.130
How did Takahashi Ryosuke get involved, then?

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.450
Apparently, Ryosuke had a 
crush on the same chick.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.900
Her name was...

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.850
Kaori, I think.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.680
You had to do that in 
this high speed corner?!

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:55.000
She was foolish. Her suicide
screwed up the lives of the others.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.550
I don't know what 
happened between them

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.400
it's been fate ever since 
they met in med school.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.610
He's not the Grim Reaper himself

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.610
he's just a pathetic guy who wanders around
because he's possessed by the Grim Reaper.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.810
He might be ready to die for real.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.020
Incredible speed. Your speed is lethal.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.140
I'll have to play wildly, or I'll be finished.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.200
It's frustrating, but I have to quit for today.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.760
I'll pay you back later, Grim Reaper.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.020
Project D's third round in 
Kanagawa finally begins tonight.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:09.930
The boss didn't give us any days off,
so we can't see the race this time.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:15.050
I guess both Itsuki and I trying to get
Saturday and Sunday off is too much to ask.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.710
Project D is the enemy,
from Kanagawa's perspective.

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.000
I wish we could send as many people
as possible to support the Gunma team.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:28.100
This time around, I hear lots of guys
saying they'd go, despite the distance.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.000
Even so, we fellow Speed Stars members can't go. I don't know what to think of this.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.200
For today, you should 
just go by yourself.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.100
Well, actually, I'd love to

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.750
but I'm kind of broke,
so I can't pay for the gas.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.200
What the hell?
You're pathetic.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.250
I've decided.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.000
I'll watch the final race no 
matter what the boss says.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:57.900
Itsuki.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:02.380
I bet the best of Kanagawa will appear.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.200
Whether Takumi wins or loses

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.560
as his best friend, I must
see his race of a lifetime.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.000
I don't care if I get fired.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I feel like I have to be there.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.800
But if he loses this time,
there won't be another one.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.700
He won't lose. 
Takumi will never lose.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.730
Okay, I got it, so don't cry, Itsuki. 
I know how you feel.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.460
Itsuki is right.
We've got to see the final race.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.450
We have to see the end, no matter what.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.700
I'm the team leader, Ikeda Ryuji. 
Thanks for coming all the way here.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.880
Nice to meet you. 
I'm Takahashi Ryosuke of Project D.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.650
These are our drivers.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.310
I'mTakahashi Keisuke.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.760
I'm Fujiwara Takumi.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.000
So you guys are Project D.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:16.000
I have a favor, or more
like a question to ask.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.400
Just tell me what
pops into your head.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.800
What is driving to you?

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.110
Let me hear your answer.
Takahashi Keisuke, you go first.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.050
In short, proof of masochism.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.070
That's interesting. 
How about you, Fujiwara?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.000
To me, it's a daily activity, 
like washing my face.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.460
That's interesting, too.
And finally, you?

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:52.700
I'm not a driver here, 
but should I answer?

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.380
I'd love to hear it.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.420
A dream.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.720
Okuyama didn't show up, after all.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.590
As he puts it, he can't find any
reason to greet his opponent.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.290
If that's how he raises
his motivation, that's fine.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:34.440
Besides, Sakamoto, did you 
sense anything from Project D?

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.570
Their presence gives me chills. It must 
come from the momentum of continuous wins.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:47.510
And yet, they aren't desperate,
or aggressive toward their opponent.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.420
They're so calm that they look 
more pro than the real ones.

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.800
I think you're right. Those three
are top notch public street racers.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.800
This is the perfect stage to test my
Zero theory, which I've been advocating.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.150
The key is to free yourself from
destruction before you begin the race.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.410
I believe that the ideal driving style can be 
achieved through a mental state of zero noise.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:24.300
The air is moist, so it'll rain from dawn through
the day tomorrow, like the weather forecast said.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.500
Wet conditions will probably benefit the
locals, because they know the course.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.300
Generally, that would be true

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:38.900
but Team Spiral tends to 
rely on their cars potential

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.300
so they probably don't like rain.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:49.250
I originally thought Project D's Eight-Six
driver would have a tough time if it was dry.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.870
Compared to Okuyama's car, the
difference in performance is just too big.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.200
But in rain, it will equal out.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.500
Plus, I can think of another
condition, besides the rain.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:09.780
In that case, Okuyama won't be
able to defeat Project D's lad.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
