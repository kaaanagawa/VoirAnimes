Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.020
Fog?!

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.900
I can't see anything...

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.470
A white void!

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.800
Incoming call

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.070
which means no oncoming 
traffic in the target area.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.040
Nice Kenta. Perfect timing.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.650
Full throttle in these conditions?!

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230
That's impossible for a human.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.670
Cleared the fog, and visibility is back.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.100
I lost.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.700
What a guy.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.700
That was so splendid that for some
reason I smile before feeling the frustration.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.660
If someone can pull that off,
there's nothing you can do.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.200
Your performance is
beyond my imagination.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.140
It's my total defeat, Project D.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.400
Act 8  [ White Demon ]

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.400
Keisuke

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.910
You did it!

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.900
Yeah.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.550
It worked out well, Kenta.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.400
I was scared to death.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.160
The fog was thicker than expected,
and I was so anxious while I was waiting.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.350
When your FD burst
out from that white fog

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.350
I was so thrilled that
I had tears in my eyes.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.790
Keisuke came up with the idea of
where and how to make his move.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.560
I gave him some hints, but I
didn't give him any concrete advice.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.200
Is that right?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.790
You've really grown, Keisuke.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.280
Aren't you saying the same
thing after every battle?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.000
That's what I think every time, 
so it can't be helped.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.630
It was incredible that you made your
 move in the high speed segment.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.280
That segment has an S curve, 
so it's not a simple straightaway.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460
I'm impressed that you
kept the throttle open.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.350
I spent a lot of time on rehearsal, and the 
usual blind training must have helped, too.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.580
Still, the fear of not
being able to see is strong.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.900
I couldn't have stepped on the gas unless 
I was sure there'd be no oncoming car.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.510
My temples are still throbbing.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.000
I must have really exceeded
the limits of my concentration.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.700
I tired myself out by building up the pace in the fog.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.200
In the end, I didn't have
enough mental strength.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.000
Maybe this is the result of the
difference in our fighting spirit.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.200
I can't accept the result of this battle.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.400
We should request a rematch.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.080
There's no way you'd 
lose in normal conditions.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.700
How can you be so sure, Sakamoto?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.100
You might have to race in order to see it.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.450
Sure the road was wet, and the visibility
was the worst thanks to the fog.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.190
The time must have been far
slower than the course record.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.580
But I'm satisfied with the race's quality,
which can't be shown by just the time.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.160
We used everything we had at
unimaginable speed in the fog.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.950
I can't repeat such a miracle
battle even if I'm asked to.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.700
Such moments only come once.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.300
That's why I'm satisfied.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:15.310
As long as we race on public streets,
the weather can't be an excuse.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.800
This also means the Zero
theory is not perfect yet.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.360
Improvement begins with a realization like that.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.450
I just have to keep improving
myself and my Zero theory.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.850
How could he choose
the lead in this fog?

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.050
Ikeda lost because of his strategy.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.100
In the first run, I'll just
put on pressure from behind.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.000
If I'm lucky, my opponent will crash on his own.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.650
Fog is that dangerous.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:10.220
It's nothing when you drive slowly, but once the pace
picks up, it's like walking on a wire between tall buildings.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.780
In any case, I won't be the lead because
the chaser has a definite advantage.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.900
That was quite a 
"meaty" hill climb, wasn't it?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.780
Very interesting.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.310
Yeah, more or less.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.700
Street battles are so deep.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.890
That dramatic scenario could only be
equaled by top category motor sports.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.200
I feel sorry for the gallery of spectators.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.040
Without any info, they don't 
know what's going on.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.400
Quite literally, you can't see anything.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.990
What a shame, because the upcoming
 downhill will be even more impressive.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.470
They chose to be the chaser.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:07.310
I see.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.400
Let me give you some
advice on pace management.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.280
Visibility is poor, so go at 
80% right after the start.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.250
Once you pick up the rhythm, raise it to 90%
and when you're confident, go full throttle.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.400
I see. How long should
 I wait for that timing?

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.590
No more than one third of the course.
Finish it off before that.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.280
I'm starting the count down.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.950
Five

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.880
Four

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.930
Three

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.880
Two

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.840
One

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.670
Go!

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.870
It's begun.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.700
Is that so?

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.320
Okay, I'll tell him.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.760
As you expected, the yellow car won.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.800
Two cars are coming down the hill, and
Hojo said you should pay attention to them.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.100
To be honest

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.930
I'm not interested, at all.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.030
Here they come.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.430
I saw wings.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.810
Huh? Wings?

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.460
On the white one in the lead.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.210
On the Eight-Six? 
It didn't have a wing.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.000
No, I didn't mean that.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.400
I saw

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.400
white wings like on birds.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.600
Alright, I can do this.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.510
He's not slow, but not as fast as I thought.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.000
It's only natural because of the fog.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.470
I'm gonna give you a hard time by 
putting pressure on you from behind.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.140
I was absolutely right when
I chose to be the chaser.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.100
You told Fujiwara something
before the start, didn't you?

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.350
What's your strategy?

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:18.150
It's not exactly a strategy. Fujiwara
can win thanks to these conditions.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.800
Then what did you tell him?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.900
An instruction about not giving too much data to our opponent. My mind is already on the next race.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.100
You mean the final battle against Sidewinder?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.910
Yeah, you could say that.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.710
But before that, I have a battle of my own.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.650
He picked up the pace.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.040
Even though he's not a local, he can 
see the course in this poor visibility.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.090
This isn't about technique.
He's got good driving sense.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.300
But he won't be able to 
continue this pace for very long.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:27.200
Even that tough Ikeda lost his concentration.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.980
Keep trying as hard as you like.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.080
You'll make a mistake in the second half. 
That's when I'll make my move.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.340
If you ask me, I'd say the result was
obvious even before the race began.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.250
But the opponent's car is so well tuned.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.000
I'm a Silvia owner myself, 
so I can tell by just looking.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:12.430
I think the balance of turning, braking, and
acceleration are better than Fujiwara's Eight-Six.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:18.400
Normally, he'd be at a disadvantage.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.000
What do you mean by "normally"?

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.000
Like driving on a circuit on a sunny day?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.700
If that's the case, vehicle
potential makes a difference.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:37.780
But in conditions like these,
it's all about the driver.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:46.000
My brother's blind training was inspired
from Fujiwara's natural cluelessness.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.640
Not just visibility, but as all
the conditions deteriorate

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.040
the Fujiwara zone gets refined.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.000
So much so that I hate it.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.810
I keep telling you the same
thing over and over, Kenta.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.500
The most fearsome mountain pass driver is

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.290
him.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.640
The way this guy's stomping 
on the accelerator is scary.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:25.530
This speed feels twice or even three
times faster because of the poor visibility.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.000
What kind of nerves does he have?
The next turn is a right hand hairpin.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.360
Is he challenging me to a braking
battle even in visibility as bad as this?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.670
No thanks. Nobody can be sure
whether he'd wreck his car or not.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.350
I don't want to be involved.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:15:00.800
Even if I fall behind a little during braking, I should be able to recover my loss during acceleration.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.610
I'm not going with you. Go ahead and
disappear from the course alone.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.780
You went in way too fast!
You won't be able to turn like that!

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.510
What the hell?!

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.400
Is my sense of speed dull because of the fog?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.450
What's important is not to
panic in a situation like this.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.940
If I accelerate precisely while minimizing
wheel spin, the car will narrow the gap by itself.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.550
My car is tuned to do exactly that.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:56.000
Even if I don't take a risky gamble, if I keep driving so I
won't lose, victory will end up in my hands regardless.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.380
He's fast. What happened?!

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.000
This's ridiculous!

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.800
Is that a 4WD?!

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.900
It disappeared...

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.070
It really disappeared from the course!

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.030
Alright!

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.320
I knew the conditions were dangerous 
because I drove the course myself.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.260
But Okuyama isn't a weak driver
who would be affected by the fog.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.560
After all, he's our team's number two driver.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.080
I knew he'd be able to
finish the race safely.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:01.800
But at the same time, I was sure he 
wouldn't be able to win no matter what.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.700
The reason why I let him
race without any advice

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.590
is because I thought he'd gain an experience
he'd never be able to have otherwise.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:16.300
He must be shocked since everything
 he's built has crumbled, but

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.450
that will definitely help Okuyama grow.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.520
This frustration will drive
him up to the next level.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:34.180
Oh man, is this what they mean
by getting bewitched by a fox?

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.630
Both Ikeda and Okuyama got defeated while
we're still trying to figure out what happened.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.200
This is a big miscalculation for our recon team.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.040
We couldn't even learn half of what 
we wanted because of the fog.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:55.380
Takahashi Ryosuke seems
to be lucky. I don't like that.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.500
He can bring luck to his side
because he's so well prepared.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.880
You look happy, Hojo.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.500
Of course I am.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.200
This festivity will finally reach the climax.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.940
A stage we could never have even wished
for has been prepared for us after all.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.350
Oh, I've been waiting for you, Takumi!

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.250
Looks like you keep winning.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.400
I have tons of things
 I want to hear from you.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.650
Spiral's car for the 
downhill was an S15, right?

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.280
What was the car like? Was it tough?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:08.120
Well, actually the course was covered in fog,
and the surface was partially wet, so

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.090
the car looked quite powerful, but the conditions
didn't allow the driver to step on the gas very hard.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.310
You still race, even in the fog?

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:23.650
It's a street racing rule that we race in any
condition so long as both teams agree to participate.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.000
This time, we were lucky because 
our opponent accepted our challenge.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.400
You may be right.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:35.400
It'd be a pain for you guys to drive all
the way from Gunma for another day.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.200
That's true, but what I really meant was

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:47.260
I didn't want the race to be canceled because 
I tend to focus better when the conditions are severe.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.250
Just like I said, right, Senpai?

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:53.470
Yeah.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.970
It rained over here that day.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.610
Kenji and I were worried 
about the weather in Hakone.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:10.200
But Itsuki stated that rain would give you an 
advantage. He was confident about that.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.700
Ahem!

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.270
Still, it feels like you've really
hit the moment of truth.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:22.090
You've accomplished something great.
The next one is the final battle.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.200
Even the high level Kanagawa
 racers are no match for Project D.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.100
Even though we were afraid of a salary cut,
we still asked the boss for a day off.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.770
Both of us are going to
take a vacation that week.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.290
I'm already so excited!

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.760
All of the Speed Stars members 
will come watch your race.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.520
I believe we'll witness the birth of a legend.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.670
How is it?

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.700
Just like you. Your work is perfect.

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:39.120
I can't feel the benefit of the wing on the streets of Akagi,
but I really wanted stability in high speed corners.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.400
All that's left is how well I can 
manage this car after a little hiatus.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.090
Ryosuke, do you really have to do this?

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:56.000
I wouldn't say anything if the 
opponent was someone else, but

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:05.000
The next one will be the final away race for Project D. 
If something happens to you, we can't redo this.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.480
You shouldn't do this. 
This isn't like you, Ryosuke.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:16.200
Sorry, Matsumoto, but this is a fate I can't avoid.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:26.000
I can't leave that person as he is. 
This is something only I can do.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:33.350
It's difficult to settle the next battle, but don't worry. I'll return no matter what.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.000
If you insist.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.000
I have one condition.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.770
Huh? Are you joking?

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.600
No, it's true, Keisuke.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.470
Someone saw Ryosuke and his FC here.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.450
Plus the FC had a huge wing.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.900
A wing?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.630
That's strange.
Was it really my brother?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.000
He said he saw his face
clearly, so I'm sure of it.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:16.600
An Akagi street racer wouldn't
mistake anyone else for Ryosuke.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:24.000
I was thinking that I hadn't seen my 
brother's car in the garage from time to time.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.730
If that's true, why does he need a wing?

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.400
I have a bad feeling.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.800
Hakone's fog is nice.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.410
It hides the dirty side of reality.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:24:03.230
When I stand still like this, there's
nothing other than absolute silence

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.500
and overwhelming loneliness.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.400
This is the state of nirvana, right, Kaori?

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:20.000
Ever since I lost you, I feel like
 I've been standing in the fog.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:26.580
I'm going to have a race against
Ryosuke where we both bet our lives.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.360
I'll send one of us to your side.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.650
So make a choice.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.180
This time, follow your heart, Kaori.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
