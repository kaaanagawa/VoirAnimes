Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.080
Hakone's fog is nice.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.270
It hides the dirty side of reality.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.800
When I stand still like this, there's
nothing other than absolute silence

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.950
and overwhelming loneliness.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.020
This is the state of nirvana, right, Kaori?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.500
Ever since I lost you, I feel like
 I've been standing in the fog.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.130
I'm going to have a race against
Ryosuke where we both bet our lives.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.710
I'll send one of us to your side.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.270
So make a choice.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.810
This time, follow your heart, Kaori.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.950
Long time no see, Ryosuke.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.450
You look a little neater, huh?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.200
It's been a while, Hojo Rin.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.910
Senpai.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.900
I've heard the story.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.230
I called Ryosuke's cell,
but it seems to be turned off.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.200
I left a message,
but I haven't heard back.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.170
I've been told that he's not
in the college lab either.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.630
If Ryosuke secretly modified his FC,
I'm sure he must have a reason for it.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.400
Matsumoto is the one who's been 
tuning and maintaining the FC

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.460
so I've tried calling him to find 
out if he knows something, but

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.790
I can't reach him either.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.830
Something is definitely not
right with both of them missing.

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.270
If that's the case, I'll just ignore this.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.650
Huh?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.870
I mean, for the time being it's
pointless for us to get upset over this.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.860
How could you not be? 
Aren't you worried?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.280
My brother must have a 
significant reason for doing this,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.000
including going solo behind our back.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.000
He's always been been like this.
You know that, don't you?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.200
He always makes the right choice.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.490
He'll come back and feign 
ignorance as if nothing happened.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.700
Just have faith in him and wait.
There's no point in worrying.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.650
Let's just act like we normally do.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.490
What we should be doing now
is preparing for the final battle.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.700
That's what my brother
would say if he were here.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.080
There's no need to worry
about a remote possibility.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.500
He's Japan's most ingenious street racer.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.170
Don't forget that.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.650
Act 9  [ Grim Reaper ]

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.260
Ryosuke

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.020
I'll be waiting here, so please
pick me up when you're done.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.650
I plan to return to Gunma
in your car's passenger seat.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.210
I haven't thought about any other way.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.000
Even if it takes several days, I'll be waiting...

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.700
Even if it rains, to the point where I get soaked...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.780
In other words, if you
don't return, I'll die here.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.000
I can really see you doing that.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.900
I'll return no matter what.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.700
Thank you.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.120
It's a promise, Ryosuke.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.490
Please come back safely.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.630
A white FC?

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.900
Yeah.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.720
A guy saw it when he was
visiting Akagi the other day.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.590
Do you mean Takahashi
Ryosuke is making a comeback?

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.400
There's no way.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.070
It's probably a copy by a hardcore fan.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.800
That could be the case.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.660
Remember those impersonators the other day?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.650
That's not likely.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.900
Akagi is Takahashi Ryosuke's home ground.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.900
Any impersonator would
get caught immediately.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.130
He's right.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.550
Hey, did Takumi say anything?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.100
Not a thing.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.660
I'd better call him.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.530
If he ignores his best friend like he did the other day, I'll chew him out.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.060
Ryosuke did?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.490
No, I don't know anything about it.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.240
Maybe it's just a look alike.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.330
Okay, bye.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.410
What's wrong?
Another impersonator?

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.440
Um, no, I don't think it's that serious.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.500
But come to think of it, we have
to thank those impersonators.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.700
After all, I met you because of them.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.700
I guess so.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.300
Hey, Takumi, why don't we go
somewhere together again?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.400
We've been to the beach,
so how about the mountains?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.800
This is way too risky.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.120
I've never seen such a high speed 
downhill stage like this anywhere.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.350
It's really disadvantageous to be in
the lead position against a local.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:51.600
He hasn't had time to become familiar
with the renewed FC after his hiatus.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:09:01.100
But all I can do now is believe in the super driving
sense from his days as Akagi's White Comet.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.580
Ryosuke

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.700
Three years ago

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.300
Eh?

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.750
I fell in love with someone.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:30.740
She was my senior by one year at college,
and a type of person I hadn't met before.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.000
Free spirited, half childish, half mature.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.730
Sometimes strong willed, but sometimes weak, a person with lots of contradictions.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.700
But that's probably why I was attracted to her.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.190
I lost my head over her to the 
extent that I couldn't control myself.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.500
It's out of character for me, I guess.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.880
I haven't told anyone about this, but can 
you bear with my little story, Matsumoto?

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.700
Cornering potential is equal, but my 
car has significantly greater power.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.650
As for braking, his car has the
advantage because of the lighter weight.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:57.150
It will become more apparent
toward the end of the battle.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.890
But that works fine for me.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.000
If I can't stop, I won't be able to
avoid slamming my car into his.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.200
There will only be one round.
If you manage to get away, you win.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.650
But I won't let you.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.590
Ryosuke

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.650
Why do you think you were born?

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.450
Have you ever thought about it, Ryosuke?

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.200
There you go again. 
Another philosophical question.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.100
Don't dodge my question, try to answer it.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.800
What do you really want to do?

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.450
Do you really want to succeed your parents?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.930
Are you attending college because
you actually want to become a doctor?

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.450
You can't be happy with that.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.140
It's rather sad if you can't 
choose what to do with your life.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.150
You're hitting a sore spot, Kaori.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.340
What makes you happy?

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.500
What makes you truly happy?

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.700
Don't you have a dream?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.010
What is your dream, Ryosuke?

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.000
Any news?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.200
I spotted the Grim Reaper's R32.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:41.700
It'll pass by your location,
chasing a white car at high speed.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.500
Please be very careful, Ikeda.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.200
Got it.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.280
I've finally got you, Grim Reaper.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:46.020
Team Spiral is proud to be the
neighborhood watch of Hakone.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.500
We won't forgive anyone who breaks
the rules of the mountain pass.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.410
Your insolence ends today.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.340
Anyway, who's driving that white FC?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.600
How reckless of you to take the lead
position against the Grim Reaper.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.800
He must have nerves of steel.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.700
Could that be

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.260
him?!

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.090
Ryosuke, there's something I haven't told you yet.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.350
I have a fiancé chosen by my parents.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:51.520
I'll have to marry him in a few years.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.200
That's a bad joke, Kaori.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:10.200
Do you really want to 
follow your parents wishes?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.280
That's not like you at all.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.190
You just don't know the true me.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.000
Then I'll begin to discover it from now on.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.540
I'm not going to give you up.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.020
No

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.270
Please give up.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.010
Why are you crying?

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.230
I'll protect you no matter what.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.120
What's wrong, Ryosuke?

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.020
I see a slight hesitation in your corner entries.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.550
Are you scared of this
super high speed stage?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.820
Or is it because of your hiatus?

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.450
You're so naive, Ryosuke.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.320
If you're spacing out, I'll wake you up.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.500
He did it already.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:40.340
Rear wheel drive cars are defenseless against that kind
of push right after the turn in when the car is unstable.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.000
The Grim Reaper did it on purpose.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.000
Please recover.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.650
Wow, that was incredible.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.330
That's more like it.
That was my way of saying "Hi."

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.550
I can control the car.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.750
It's well tuned, as always, Matsumoto.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:26.650
Now I know I can push myself
to the limit without hesitation.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.070
Here comes the next one. It'll be harder.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:39.200
The Grim Reaper is acting
differently from before.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.120
He's seriously trying to...

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.250
He missed?!

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.110
The Grim Reaper's serious 
attempt to crash was dodged.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.810
What incredible acceleration.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:03.200
There's no more doubt about that FC.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.930
The charismatic driver, who was once
the best in northern Kanto, has returned.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.000
What made him do that?

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.830
Ryosuke...

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.500
What's going on?

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.000
The Grim Reaper is acting strange,
showing true hostile intent.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.000
The other guy is well aware of it,
but he isn't even trying to escape.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.200
This is no ordinary battle.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:48.220
It looks like I ran into
an extraordinary situation.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.000
Just like you, Ryosuke.
Your earlier hesitation is gone.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.500
You've got incredible adaptability.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.480
You're a much better 
driver than I expected.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.500
Are you nearby, Kaori, watching us?

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.700
I dedicate this battle to you.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.800
Even if I die here tonight, I won't regret it.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.200
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.650
I'm sorry, Hojo.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.370
I can't marry you.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:06.510
Hold on, that's so abrupt. Tell me why.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.800
This has nothing to do with
our parents arrangement.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:16.220
Don't you know that I love you
from the bottom of my heart?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.980
This is scary.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.350
Their tension is off the scale.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.000
I'm having a hard time keeping up with them, 
much less cutting in between them.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.020
Besides, that Takahashi Ryosuke,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.690
I heard he was the logical type, but that's not true.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.840
Only a genius could pull off this kind of driving.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.600
It's almost a miracle for a 
non local to maintain this high pace.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:25.640
This course is so unique that even the
locals don't push themselves to the limit,

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.910
because you only have one life.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.700
So fast.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.090
His handling of the rotary
engine is almost an art.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:50.700
So, even being known as the logical type, it's because he
has both the sense of a genius and an all too clever mind?

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.700
That's the true nature of Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:08.430
But the Grim Reaper will show his
truly frightening nature up ahead.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.820
Ryosuke.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.300
You're a mysterious person.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.200
You're younger than me, but more 
composed, which irritates me a bit.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.700
But you're always honest, 
kind and strong minded

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.170
the type of person who
can make a woman happy.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.800
I'm not sure if I can be the one.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.800
Maybe I don't deserve your feelings.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.650
I wish I could

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.300
be by your side forever.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
