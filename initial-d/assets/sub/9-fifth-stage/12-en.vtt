Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.200
I've come all the way to Kanagawa!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.650
One and a half months behind
 his arch rival, Fujiwara Takumi

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.750
Takeuchi Itsuki finally steps
into the land of Hakone!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.600
You got it completely wrong.
You're just a sightseer.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.650
The woman at the kiosk told me that it's rare
to see Mt. Fuji so clearly at this time of year.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.120
Does this mean something good will happen?

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.200
It should! Today is Project D's 
final battle in Kanagawa!

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.960
Takumi's victory is guaranteed!

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.090
I hope it's that simple.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.310
Oh, I thought I recognized that voice.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.100
Nakazato and Shoji 
of the Myogi Night Kids?!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
I knew you guys would be here 
because this is the final race.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.060
It's great that you came
all the way to support us.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.620
You know, that sounds really disturbing.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.700
Don't think of Fujiwara Takumi as
the representative of your team only.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.310
Project D carries the hopes
 of everyone in the Gunma area.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.440
So today is the last day we
get to see Mt. Fuji from this deck.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.050
I still can't believe the situation I'm in.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.470
It still feels weird that
I'm a member of Project D.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.000
You might as well thank me.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.400
I went all the way to Akina to invite you.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.000
Yeah, you did.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.450
Wipe that look off.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.250
Don't lose.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.360
I haven't seen your opponent yet,
but I sense something really bad.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.060
My intuition as a street racer is usually correct.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.240
Your opponent must be like a ghost, and you'll have a tough time.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.990
Seriously?!

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.000
But I don't think you'll lose.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.650
I'm saying it because you were like a
ghost before, but now I can see you.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.250
So you won't lose.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.800
We've gotta win.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.230
If they're focused on the data, we just 
have to be better than we are now.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.500
Act 12  [ Brothers ]

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.830
Great day, isn't it?

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.300
Look, the surface of 
Ashino Lake shines like a mirror.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.900
I haven't seen you for a while.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.810
I want to enjoy the hot spring
and drink tonight. It'll be fun.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.750
What are you talking about, Sayuki? We don't have time for that tonight.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.400
I know. I was joking.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:24.580
I've come all the way from Karuizawa
to root for the cute Takumi.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.000
I'm looking forward to seeing
how handsome he has become.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.840
That aside, how are you
doing in the races?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.000
It's tough.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.850
I hate to admit it, but I'm always blown
away by the level of those around me.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.310
After I started racing, I realized
how great professional drivers are.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.660
Project D's achievement 
is incredible, almost divine.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.680
A lot of pros have been defeated.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.000
It might be different this time around.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.530
Sidewinder has a professional manager.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.750
You might not know this, but this event has
caught the attention of people from all sides.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.000
If they win, it will cause a stir.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.770
This might not end as a mere carnival among a small group of street racers.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.850
Is this battle going to be tough?

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:31.000
Probably so.
Kubo Eiji's bio is very interesting.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.850
He used to work at the racing
division of a large manufacturer

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.580
but he left the company a few years ago, and now he manages his own shop.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.140
He develops aftermarket parts while he builds
demo cars to compete for times in the circuits.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.150
His parts are known for
their high performance.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.500
He's a real pro.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.140
What's unique is that he used to compete in rallying,
and even won some big prizes in provincial races.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.550
He sounds tough, the circuit part really creates an almighty air about him.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.200
You're right.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.300
By the way, Fumihiro...

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.810
What's today's pasta?

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.890
I beg you, please.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.200
Can you call and cancel the event?

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.000
You can't do that any more.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.750
If you really don't want to do it, 
you should call Hojo yourself.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.630
That's impossible. He's scary.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.200
Stop talking like a little child.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.500
You said you'd do it, so be
responsible for what you said.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.600
I don't feel like it.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.020
And there's a show I want to watch, too.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.000
Are you scared?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.200
I've never felt fear, but
this is too much of a bother.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.300
I don't understand the
meaning of racing cars.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.250
What's the point?

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.700
You should ask Hojo yourself.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:08.960
Whether you drive or not,
you're obligated to see Hojo on time.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.630
It's like they're glued together.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.200
From where I stand 
you're just plain creepy

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.490
No matter how close you are, that won't
bring you victory. I'll let you know that.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.450
Hojo

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.930
I've finished my data
collection and analysis.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:43.360
I think I know the combat potential of the FD,
based on the data from the first three races
in Kanagawa and last night's practice.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.500
Your NSX's settings have
been completed accordingly.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.830
Let's take advantage of the 
NA engine and mid ship layout.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.840
Traction is everything in hill climbing.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.850
The key is how efficiently the car can transfer
its power to the ground at the exit of each corner.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:06.780
If you can gain a 0.1 second advantage in one section,
you can gain a 1 second advantage in ten sections.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.800
Motorsports are plain and simple.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.500
It's all about physics, although
I don't have to explain it to you now.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.640
Let me get to the point.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.170
Based on the assumption of using the 
same driver in the same environment

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.700
your car should have a 15 second advantage.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.960
15 seconds is not a big advantage
for the entire distance of the course.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.230
Their FD is far more refined than expected, which is my miscalculation, but

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.550
I did my best under the given circumstances.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.630
Do you have any qualms with
 only a 15 second advantage?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.600
It's enough.
Who do you think I am, Kubo?

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.300
Do you think I'll lose to some punk
from Gunma in driving technique?

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.700
You can't make light
of the punk from Gunma.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.400
If you fail to use that 15 second 
advantage properly, you might get screwed.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.200
Cool!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.170
Even though it's only free practice,
it still gave me goose bumps.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.800
Takahashi Keisuke is going
to race against that monster?

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.870
How is it, Hojo?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.140
Pretty good. Well done.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.000
Mr. Kubo!

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.000
What? Inui hasn't come yet?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.410
I called his mother, and found out
that he left home a while ago.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.070
It's like he's playing hooky, 
not from school, but from racing?

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:59.560
What should we do? Should we
arrange a substitute for the downhill?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.200
Do that, but only as insurance.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.000
We'll wait for Inui until the last moment.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.300
Chickening out right when it counts.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.600
What a brat.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.550
I think he's out there 
somewhere wondering what to do.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.550
I'm sure he'll make up his mind and 
show up before the downhill race starts.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.780
I hope so.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.760
I thought you'd never 
show up in Hakone again.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.200
The Grim Reaper GT-R is 
no more, but I'm still alive.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll go wherever I want to.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.800
We haven't talked like this in a while.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.200
I'm sorry, Gou.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.490
I've caused a lot of problems
for you and our father.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.830
Brother, why did you come here?

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:58.900
To watch your driving.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.270
You got a problem with that?

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.250
I'm not going to give you 
any advice like I did before.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.700
You have a great strategist anyway.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.590
There's just one thing.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.000
Ryosuke is big.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.700
You're fortunate.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.650
As a man who loves cars and mountain
passes, you can't be happier than this.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:27.550
Do your very best. 
Use everything you've learned.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.200
And enjoy yourself.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.800
This time, I'll watch you until the end.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.850
It's about to start.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.930
This hill climb is going to be good.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.700
You were talking to your
little brother a while ago.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.150
What kind of advice did you give him?

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.000
I didn't give him anything of the sort.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.770
I just removed a heavy burden from his back.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.710
You can't perform well by using 
negative emotions as motivation.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:24.550
I just figured he wouldn't be able to defeat
Ryosuke's little brother in that condition.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.700
I see.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.860
My Zero Theory has a similar rule, 
which is to get rid of all negative emotions.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:36.100
Anger, jealousy, grudge, self glory, and sadness.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.010
Those negative emotions will not
guide a driver in the right direction.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.000
Do you know why Project D is so strong?

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.230
They always look like they're having fun.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.300
They love cars and mountain passes. 
That's what drove them until now.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.240
No matter how difficult the situation becomes,
they somehow find a reason to enjoy it.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.700
On the other hand, Kanagawa
drivers aren't enjoying this at all

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.700
because their sensibility
and pride get in the way.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.000
You corner yourself the moment you think there's no way you can lose.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.650
You've got to have fun.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.700
Rather than winning or losing, it's a matter of whether you can enjoy this or not

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.430
especially because today is
the final day of the carnival.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.480
Five seconds to the start.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.210
Four

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.130
Three

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.220
Two

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.250
One

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.130
Go!

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.740
Here they come.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.280
Incredible.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.090
The NSX looks much more
aggressive than during practice.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.650
It hugs the road like a real supercar

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.690
Watching it gives me chills.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.870
Plus, it's in the front position, which means the
FD has no chance of winning if the race drags on.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.590
I don't like his lack of focus.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.150
What's on your mind?
I see your hesitation from behind.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.370
Brother, you can't show up
and spout such nonsense.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:53.650
You know what my responsibilities are.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.200
I did everything in 
preparation to win this race.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.900
My motivation was high enough.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.210
But you still think it's not enough?

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.900
I don't want to lose no matter what

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.030
so what were you trying to say, Brother?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.550
You could have jinxed him.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.370
I wonder if Gou will
understand your true intentions.

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.700
Regardless of his motivation, 
I still don't think Sidewider will lose.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:31.500
They spent enough time on
 preparations in order to win.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.590
They have a strategist named Kubo Eiji.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.700
Kubo, huh?

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600
That old fart stinks.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.000
He's just sneaky, nothing like Ryosuke, who has aesthetic quality.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.700
I see. That sounds more 
like the Hojo Rin I know.

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.290
Gou might be confused for a
 short period of time, but he'll get it.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.450
First, he has to empty his mind

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.460
so that he can recall what's truly important.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.590
Omiya, what kind of driver is Hojo of Sidewinder?

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.650
I know Rin, the older brother

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.700
but I've never competed in the circuit
 against Gou, because he's much younger.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.480
The Hojo Brothers are pretty 
well known on the circuit.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.550
I remember the older Rin always guided his
younger brother by showing him the ideal lines.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.250
They seemed to like each other,
and were exceptionally fast to boot.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.940
They're very similar in some aspects to the Takahashi Brothers of Project D.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.250
The cool headed and logical older brother and the emotional younger brother.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.000
You can say they are alike, 
especially the younger brothers.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:56.650
They both drive a peaky car with a narrow margin
of control, and they compete in cornering speed.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.000
Concentration and mad dash
speed are their strengths.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.990
This will undoubtedly become a sprint race.

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.760
The car in the lead will 
make a dash at some point.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.500
They just passed the second hairpin.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.850
The second hairpin, huh?

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:38.640
From there, section 2 is a mid speed stage where the cornering speed is slow.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.300
Section 4, which is between
two hairpin curves, is similar

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.240
so section 2 and 4 are where
the NSX will perform better.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.210
It has a clear advantage in terms of section time.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:59.560
That's because of better braking due to the mid ship
layout, and the NA engine's immediate response.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.050
The first key point is section 2.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.450
If we can surprise the FD driver
by picking up the pace there

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.400
he'll wear down his tires
just trying to catch up.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.700
NA cars are easier on tires, 
compared to turbo charged cars.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.250
If we hold on until section 4
and launch a full attack

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.800
the rear wheel drive, turbo charged FD won't be able to keep up.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.800
Given the fact that Hojo chose the front position, that must be his scenario.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.920
The battle will take a new turn from there.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.510
I don't understand.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:40.300
We used to drive just for fun,
 but that was a long time ago.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.800
There's something strange
about my brother now.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.300
I'd better stop thinking so hard.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.540
I just have to show 
how fast I normally drive

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.250
with this car.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.300
He's started to show sharper movements.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.700
I don't like this.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.750
He suddenly pulls away even
 if I don't make any mistakes

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.600
which is exactly what my brother predicted.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:14.000
He gives off the same 
feeling as a certain someone.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.770
I'd be panicked if I hadn't anticipated this.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.150
But this isn't where the real battle takes place.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:33.340
He might be shocked by
the NSX's speed more or less.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:39.000
The hill climb of this vehicle class was 
always fought between turbo charged cars.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:45.390
The NSX is the only exception, as far as domestic sports cars are concerned.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:51.900
The expensive and large engine is
mounted in the middle of the chassis

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.050
which gives the car superb
 handling on a twisty course.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.300
The high cornering speed
of the mid ship layout

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:04.080
and the fast cornering exit speed
of the NA engine's linear response.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.300
The butt kicking acceleration of the NA engine will become even handier on public roads

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.610
with so many more short
 corners than circuits have.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.500
But I don't think he's upset,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:24.550
because he's familiar with the type of driver who 
has a unique style of using the NA engine's advantage.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.880
You mean Fujiwara?

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:34.770
I think Hojo Gou's NSX driving
style is similar to Fujiwara's.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.600
If you adapt that type 
of driving to the hill climb.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.520
That's a difficult opponent to deal with.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.650
That's true.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.480
But I knew early on that our
opponent would be using an NSX.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.240
It's not like Keisuke and I just 
sat back and waited for today.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.460
We have our own trump card.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.560
Keisuke, use all the skills you've
learned up until today in this race.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:30.590
I don't get it.
What did they come here for?

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.050
Even women like them.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.000
It's odd to see someone like
them in a place like this.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.650
What should I do?

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.840
I can't just show up like nothing's happened.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.800
The meeting time is long past.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.050
But I can't go home either.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:57.000
Mom would be angrier than Hojo.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:05.800
Why am I always like this, running away at the
most critical moment and disappointing Mom?

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.780
But the person who's most disappointed is...

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.900
Hey, young man!

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.730
What's the matter? 
You look so gloomy.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.490
Well, um... nothing really.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.800
Really?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.300
You've been looking down and
sighing for quite some time.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.100
You look like you're a high school
student. Do you love cars?

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.000
Did you come here to see the battle?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:40.000
It's not that I love them,
but I feel like I do more or less...

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.260
More or less, huh? Oh, whatever.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.650
I'm Sayuki.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.220
This sexy lady is Mako.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.050
What's your name?

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.280
Shinji... Inui Shinji.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.500
They just passed the third hairpin.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.350
I have their section time. 
Looks like their pace has increased.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.000
So far, it's going as planned.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.010
Good enough.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.250
Shinji, do you live around here?

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.450
Yes.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.600
We came all the way from Gunma.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.700
Amazing, huh?

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.150
Yeah.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.100
Why did you come all the
 way here just to see a race?

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.200
Well, that's because we
used to be street racers.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.550
Besides, it's fun.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.010
Right, Mako?

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.450
Yes, it is.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.700
It's thrilling just to watch, and it's even more
fun if you sit behind the steering wheel.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.000
Fun?

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.200
Here they come!

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.700
Why? What made them so excited?

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.700
What's your take, Mako?

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:11.800
Hard to say, but at least 
the NSX's traction is impressive.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:19.150
The exit of this corner is really steep, but it 
accelerated quickly without losing balance.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:22.500
The FD is at a disadvantage after all, 
because its response was one step behind.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.490
Hojo's red car wasn't having fun.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.450
But the yellow car was smiling.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.490
They passed the hairpin at the observatory,
and have entered section 4.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.550
This is where it begins.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.900
It's begun.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.250
I can't conserve the tires from here
on, but I'm counting on you, my FD.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.370
Please hold on.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
