Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

After graduating from high school, Fujiwara Takumi

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
joined the Project D team organized by Takahashi Ryosuke,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
and won victories as a downhill specialist in

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
out of prefecture races in Tochigi, Saitama and Ibaraki,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
along with the hill climber Takahashi Keisuke.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
However, Takumi's race against his last opponent,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
Joshima Toshiya of Purple Shadow, ended on a bitter note

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:57.380 line:50 %
with him winning in the overall results, but losing the battle.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.620
I really do feel awkward with just one hand.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.820
I won't be able to respond fast
 enough if something happens.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.410
One hand steering only works

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.450
when you're absolutely confident in your driving

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.520
while anticipating the future with 100% accuracy,
even when pushing yourself to the limit.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250
It's exactly like Ryosuke said.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.550
Without having 100% confidence
in controlling everything

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.200
you can't fight a battle like this.

Tofu Shop

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm done with the delivery.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.500
Good job.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.250
I'm taking a nap
before going to work.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.700
Where are you going next?

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.150
There's no race this week because
the Eight-Six has to be repaired.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.050
The last battle will be
in Ibaraki next weekend.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.430
After that, we'll head to Kanagawa.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.260
Going that far is gonna be a pain.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.850
You're finally going to face real difficulties.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.250
Act 1  [ Fateful Encounter ]

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.860
Takumi.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.750
Yo, Takumi.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.900
What's up?

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.330
Hi, Iketani, and you too, Kenji.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.250
I feel sorry for you,
since it's still hot at night.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.220
Hey, don't treat me like Kenji.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.850
I'm working, but he's just goofing off.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.030
What's with you?

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.330
Can't you put it a little differently, Iketani?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.040
Right.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.740
Kenji has no date to spend time with.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.650
Shut up!

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.150
Street racers don't need girls!

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.190
How many times have I said that?

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.030
Hey, when will your Eight-Six be ready?
You're doing more mods again, aren't you?

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.150
This time, the main issue is the suspension, and the tire size is being changed, too.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.450
And strengthening the chassis
plus the reduction of weight.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.650
You're leaving the looks completely unchanged, but modding what's inside, huh?

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.400
I wonder what kind
of car it's going to be?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.010
It's awesome?
Totally awesome?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.660
After all, you are Project D's undefeated downhill ace, with an uninterrupted series of victories.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.710
Oh, that's right, Takumi.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:46.030
Do you go on trips with Takahashi Keisuke,
other than Project D's expeditionary races?

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.250
Huh?

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.590
Um, no, I don't.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.050
What made you ask that, Kenji?

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:04.030
A friend of my friend apparently raved about meeting Project D's double aces last weekend, on a mountain pass in Saitama.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.000
What?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.990
I never went somewhere like that.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.330
I thought so.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.400
It didn't sound right.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.780
Then what the heck's going on?

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.650
Mistaken for someone else?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.840
Heel and toe!

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.950
How was that, Takumi?

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.700
Someday, I'll emerge as
a downhiller with my Levin.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.650
That's my dream.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.800
Reality is harsh.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.300
What?

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.090
What do you mean?

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.600
I'm not talking about you.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.630
You know I drive around town for
deliveries during the daytime, right?

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.960
When I see middle and high school kids
having fun, that thought pops into my head.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.250
Uh huh.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.150
I've come to think that
summer break is incredible.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.320
You can play around every day.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.600
Now that I've got a job,
I feel such a stark difference.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.260
I see.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.290
We had summer break last year.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.860
One year makes a huge difference, doesn't it?

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.530
It makes me sad to think that we'll never have
such a summer break again for the rest of our lives.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.950
Hey, do you miss...

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.380
Natsuki?

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.950
The reason I said
I have to stay here...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.440
is because I want to join
a new team and learn a lot.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.320
I think that will bring
me closer to my dream.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.960
You wanted to go to Tokyo, didn't you?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.400
Then you have to go, no matter what.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.520
If you don't do what you want because
you let a temporary emotion take control

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.710
you'll eventually come 
to regret it in the future.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.760
Well, I guess I did for
a while, but I'm over it.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.300
I don't feel lonely.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.350
She went to Tokyo to pursue her dream.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.050
Is that so?

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.280
I'm honestly rooting for her
as she chases her dream.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.050
Do you come to this mountain pass often?

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.500
This is the second time, I guess.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.850
It's boring to only drive on Akina.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:42.670
What?!

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:43.560
Seriously?!

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.470
I wonder what's going on.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.620
They're getting excited for some reason.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.320
I heard Project D's
double aces are coming.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.420
Really?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.750
Awesome!

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:53.730
Let's go see

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:54.380
Yeah

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.110
How could that be possible?

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.850
No idea.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.440
A panda Trueno and a yellow FD?

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.320
W-what the?

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.410
T-shirts with logos

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.150
And dressed the same way?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.650
I've never seen anything like that.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.630
Excuse me, but aren't you 
Takahashi and Fujiwara of Project D?

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.310
Hold on.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.110
I'm sorry, but I can't answer
yes or no to that question.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.310
You see, we didn't come
here for an official visit.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:50.560
In other words, this is supposed to be a secret, we don't want to create a buzz.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.980
Right, Keisuke?

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.230
He's acting so casual with Keisuke.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.710
Besides, <i>that</i> Keisuke is too short.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.060
Hey, is it okay for you to let 
them do whatever they want?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.170
It's obvious they're imposters.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:09.080
Okay or not, I don't want to get involved.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.750
They're too embarrassing to watch.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.120
Excuse me.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.350
Do you mind if I take a picture with you?

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:16.980
Yay

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.430
They're popular with girls.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.530
Screw it.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.440
I can't stand this.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.080
Now I'm gonna be in trouble.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.370
Hey imposter!

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.820
Who the hell are you?

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.420
Hey, that's what I want to ask you.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.390
What?

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.100
What do you mean?

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.610
I know you're not with Project D.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.500
What makes you say that
we're not with Project D?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.050
I have proof, which is...

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.000
this guy next to me.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.240
He's the real Fujiwara Takumi.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.380
Say what?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.950
It sounds so fake.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.030
We have proof.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.470
Hey, Takumi, show them your license.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.600
Um...

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.710
I left it in the car.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:13.700
What the?!

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.820
You moron!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.350
How come you're not carrying
such an important thing?!

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.170
Oh, I get it.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.500
You guys are imposters.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:28.100
Looks like you've got
a Levin, which is so bogus.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.440
Say what?!

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.300
Bogus?

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.650
Fujiwara Takumi drives a panda Trueno

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.650
like that.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.350
He's right, you're a fake!

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.860
You're an imposter!

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.820
What was that?

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:40.550
That's rude

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.350
I knew it.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.100
I had a bad feeling that
something like this would happen.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.950
The real Trueno is being repaired

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:56.800
The suspension was damaged when the car hit
a curb during the last downhill battle in Ibaraki.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.550
Well? Surprised?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.740
Only the real person knows that.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.230
Hey, keep your mouth
shut if you don't know.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:14.320
With all due respect, I, Fujiwara Takumi,
am famous for my precise vehicle control.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:21.130
I'd never hit a curb and
damage my car during a battle.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.260
What the hell is with him?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.150
I'll forget what I saw today.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:37.750
so don't ever pretend to be us again.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.140
Let's go, Keisuke.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.750
Don't mess around with us.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.210
Hey, wait

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:48.990
What?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.400
You met the imposters?!

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.200
Yes.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.130
It's just as I thought,
there are imposters out there.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.850
Excuse me.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.710
I want to see Mr. Fujiwara Takumi.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:11.080
I've been told that I could contact
Mr. Fujiwara of Project D if I came here.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.650
Are you Mr. Fujiwara of Project D?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.730
Yes, I am.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.370
Personally, I don't have a grudge
against you, but that was for Tomoko.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.710
You should know what I'm talking about.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.630
Who is this Tomoko girl?

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.860
I have no idea.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.650
Acting like you know nothing?

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.130
You're such a coward.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.280
Now, now.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.680
Just calm down.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.000
I don't know what's going on,
but we should talk this out.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.450
You guys are his friends, right?

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.710
I can't trust you, and I have no
intention of talking to you either.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.570
Hey, don't be so stubborn.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.860
In any case, he tricked my best
friend and now she's miserable.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.650
I admit that my friend was
careless for pursuing you

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.700
but she's a good, honest person.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:43.290
I can't stand a guy who'd take advantage of his fame to play around with a girl's heart.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.380
That's dishonest and horrible.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.440
That's all I wanted to say.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.250
Good bye.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.790
Oh, come on.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.950
Are you sure this is the 
guy who hit on your friend?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.260
How can I be?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.630
This is ridiculous, right, Iketani?

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.100
I know.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.050
It must be that imposter.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.800
Imposter?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.160
Right.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.960
There's is an imposter,
who's chubby and ugly.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.400
It sounds so fake.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.920
I can't believe a story like that.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.600
Regardless, double check
and see if it's really him.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:31.090
You can find out whether he's the same person or not by just snapping a picture and mailing it to your friend.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.520
If you insist.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.350
She's not responding.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.520
I wonder if she's out of the area.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.190
I'll send her a mail, though.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.410
What a bummer.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.150
I have to go now.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.020
I've got to catch the train.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.710
This's exactly what
I was worried about.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.850
Those imposters have a lot
of nerve hitting on girls.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.030
I don't know what's going on.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.410
How can this be happening to me?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.350
You'd better let Takahashi 
Ryosuke know about this, Takumi.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.800
Hello?

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.540
Oh, Fujiwara, what's up?

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.820
There are imposters?

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.950
Yeah, I heard a little about
that from another source.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.100
Yes, and...

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:41.690
What? Really?

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.030
If it's that bad, we can't
leave them alone, can we?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.990
I understand.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.640
I'll get right on it.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.840
Don't worry.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.900
If we use our network

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.760
it shouldn't take too long to catch these <i>rats.</i>

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.510
Leave this to me.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.320
Anyhow, that was a real
disaster for you, wasn't it?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.000
Just forget about it.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.390
It's just a misunderstanding.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.360
I know that, but I feel down.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.690
That girl was really 
mad at me, wasn't she?

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:18.490
I've never met a girl before
who gave me a dirty look.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.680
I was more shocked by
her glare than the slap.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:26.700
Personally, I don't have any grudge
against you, but that was for Tomoko.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.040
You should know what I'm talking about.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.350
What's wrong with me?

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.570
I feel so antsy, but
I don't know what to do.

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:43.910
I don't get it.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.080
Hello, Tomoko

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.750
This is Mika.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.150
Did you see the picture?

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.220
Wha?

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.120
Totally different face!

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.180
No way?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.300
Take a look at it carefully.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.900
You know, he might
look different in a photo.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.960
He doesn't?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.490
Totally different person?!

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.000
Okay.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.260
No, not okay.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.730
Oh crap, I...

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.230
I gave a full swing slap
to the totally wrong guy.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.640
Thank you for coming.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.320
Another hot day.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.810
You really think so?

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:27.790
It's totally possible.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.130
I'm sure of it.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.260
What are you talking about?

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.290
Well, it's about the girl from yesterday.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.350
He says her and Takumi
would make a nice couple.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.390
Think about it.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.250
Their first meeting was so dramatic.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:47.250
My instincts tell me that there
was a spark between them.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:53.000
Now that you mention it, Takumi was still upset about the incident later.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.640
You see, you see?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.710
Of course he was.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.350
Anyone would be.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.000
She threw a slap all of a sudden, and left.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.110
SLLAAAP, just like that.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.170
That could be the end.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.800
I don't think this is over.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.250
It's just a hunch.

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.070
Hi, is this Ryosuke?

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.360
It's me.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.160
The Eight-Six is ready, and
I'm going to take it to him.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.440
Okay.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.330
I was going to call 
you about that matter.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.280
I found the tag number of the imposter's car.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.130
Huh? Already?

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.520
I don't have the time, so I'll
let Keisuke take care of this.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:41.690
I told him not to get too rough, but can you
watch over him while following up on the matter?

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.750
Okay, you can count on me.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:49.590
Also, it's a little early, but I'll recon the Kanagawa area with Kenta tomorrow.

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.580
I see.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.020
The time has come.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:58.470
Project D is getting closer
to entering its final stage.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.860
I feel fulfilled.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.130
The real challenge begins now.

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.170
I'll go over courses
more carefully than usual.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.540
Okay.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.800
We have one last race in Ibaraki.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.610
That next hurdle isn't very high.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.890
Once it's over, Kanagawa, also known as 
the holy ground of street racing, will be next.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.250
The battles will be unimaginably tough

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:29.350
but once we overcome the challenge, the true 
meaning of "D" in Project D will become apparent.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.850
Are you Mr. Fujiwara of Project D?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.850
Who the hell are you?

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.150
I'm just a noob.
My name is Akiyama Wataru.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.550
Hey, chill out.
I just wanna have a friendly talk.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:57.900
I'm not picking a fight or anything.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.350
See?
We're both Eight-Six drivers.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.320
I, um... how do I put it?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:16.420
As an Eight-Six driver, I'm very interested in the driving of the famous Fujiwara Takumi.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.400
I wonder if you'd show me 
your incredible driving technique.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.950
No, I'm not supposed to do that.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.250
Just one flashy drift, please.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:36.360
My request is that you burst out sideways
from the top of that bridge over there, then.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.470
I can't.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.050
Ryosuke won't allow that.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:48.780
The exit is a 90 degree bend, so if you can clear the
corner with only accelerator work, the crowd will go nuts.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.650
On the line cornering, you see?

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.920
Don't screw around with me!

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.310
It's not as easy as you think.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.390
There's no such god like driver
who can do it on the first try.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.330
You're right.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:00.760
Normally, it's impossible.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.800
Here he comes.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:10.250
But I guess the world is big, and there's one
moron who can pull it off without any practice.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.240
Only one.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.850
Alright, listen guys.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.750
You'd better pay attention and watch what's gonna happen very carefully.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.850
You don't get to see it this close very often.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.670
This is real drifting.

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.150
Shit, a panda Trueno!

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
So fast.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.950
He's much better than before.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.160
What was that?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.750
Could it be the real one?

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.580
It must be.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.850
No other Eight-Six could do that.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.940
I just remembered
some urgent business.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.930
Let's go, Keisuke.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:01.820
Okay.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.980
What a coincidence.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.600
Your name is Keisuke, huh?

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.350
Mine, too.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.120
It's been a while, Wataru.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.370
Yeah, it looks like you're doing alright.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.360
He was the real!

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.830
Now, what should we do with them?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:31.420
What gets me most is that
they used Project D's name.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:40.850
The team's fame is like a medal of honor.
We managed to build it with the entire team's dedication.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.590
We're sorry!

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:43.860
Please forgive us!

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.650
The second problem

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.640
is that my impostor is so incredibly ugly.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.980
That deserves a few broken bones.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.750
Sorry that I'm so ugly.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.340
Dang.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.800
Just kidding.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:10.150
We won't resort to violence or anything,
but make sure you never do this again.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:12.710
We can get your name and
address from the tag number.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.130
Don't underestimate our information network.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.900
I'll never do it again.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.860
Being in Project D was my dream.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.180
Oh, Fujiwara, you have something
you wanted to tell them, right?

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.550
Um...

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.450
you picked up a girl 
named Tomoko, didn't you?

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.150
I got in trouble because of that.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:43.450
Make sure you contact her, and
clear up this misunderstanding

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.180
since it's been a real pain for me.

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.580
I will!

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:46.780
I will!

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.850
I'm very sorry!

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.080
Make sure you do it.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.400
Okay.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.550
As you'd expect from a local, he's pretty good for what his car is capable of.

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:11.620
I wonder how far Project D will go.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.400
We'll show them we're out of their league.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:18.150
The Kanagawa area is known as
the holy ground of street racing.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
