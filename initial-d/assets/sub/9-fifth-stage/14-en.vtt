Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.490
He's making it obvious that he's just cruising. He's not pushing it to the limit.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.090
Even so, he's still fast, and
maintaining a high speed pace.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.600
Nice execution.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.450
I didn't expect him to be able 
to pull off such an elegant move.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.960
I didn't realize he was so 
skillful until I drove behind him.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.480
That aside, his car seems so fun to drive.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.540
It's quite shocking to see a driver who can compete at this high of a level.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.990
Has my NSX ever looked 
like that from the outside?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.600
I'm being sucked in...

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.800
I'm being sucked in
 by this pleasant rhythm

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.120
and getting synchronized.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.760
You can never be certain about
the outcome of a competition.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.670
We were outsmarted in data collection, but it's still within our expectations.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.720
We ran our simulation with a reasonable margin, just in case. We're not stupid.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.630
Maybe not by 15 seconds, but our 
car still has an absolute advantage.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.710
After all, unlike circuits, unexpected things happen on mountain passes.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.210
So far, our opponent is doing an excellent job.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.150
We haven't lost yet.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.000
This time, our leader will 
turn the situation around.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.550
If he can manage this second run,
there's no reason for us to lose.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.250
Nothing can shake our absolute advantage.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.000
This pleasant feeling will 
eventually come to an end.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.100
There'll be a moment when
it will switch to combat mode.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.830
He'll make a full throttle dash
like I did in the first run.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.040
If my NSX and I can't keep up 
with it, this battle will be over.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.000
Where? Where are you
going to make your move?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.820
This is beyond our expectations.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.610
An FD's cruising speed can't be that fast.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.120
I can do it. I'm focused.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.850
This is fun. 
I've wanted to fight a battle like this.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.750
Act 14  [ End of the Ultimate Hillclimb! ]

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.000
I'm not mentally ready yet.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.300
Why did my spurt fail in the first run?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.720
Is he better than Kubo and I had imagined?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.000
I don't get it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.150
Does my car really 
have an advantage?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.490
Or am I the problem?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.260
I have so many doubts that
I have nothing I can rely on.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.640
I don't know how to turn this around.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.790
What should I do, Brother?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.150
You beat your best time again today.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.900
You're noticeably getting better
 because your times are consistent.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.750
Your advice is always spot on.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.750
You know exactly what to 
do to improve the time.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.200
Circuit racing is really fun.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.300
I like the fact that my time 
clearly shows how I've improved.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.200
You can't find a situation where
 you can go flat out elsewhere.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.000
Right.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.350
But you have the right aptitude.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.000
Your rate of improvement is incredibly fast.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.100
I think you have talent, Gou.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.000
What was it?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.330
What did my brother say right 
before the start of the race?

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.650
You're fortunate.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.500
As a man who loves cars and mountain passes, you can't be happier than this.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:33.500
Do your very best. 
Use everything you've learned.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.550
And enjoy yourself.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.830
Hey, Mako

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.830
doesn't Shinji remind you of Takumi?

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.900
He does, he does.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.900
The moment I saw you, I felt that.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.330
You just seem to have a similar
atmosphere, especially the pure side.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.190
Who's Takumi?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.700
Project D's Fujiwara Takumi.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.300
You'll be able to see
 his driving from here.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.320
Do you know Project D's Fujiwara Takumi?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.750
More or less.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.280
We fought a battle against him, and lost.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.480
A battle?

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.800
I'm beginning to understand.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.340
If he's better than me, it's pointless
to try and figure out what to do.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.250
As a driver who pursues
 speed and technique

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.150
if I can see something unprecedented, it should be a thrilling opportunity.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.150
Make your move.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.150
But remember, I'm persistent.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.950
We were partners back then, and we were
 confident that we would never lose in our area.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.800
They fought a battle against Fujiwara Takumi?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.900
Takumi had something
superior, even back then.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.600
Even if you lose, you feel refreshed.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.800
He has a pleasant aura. He's got a soothing smile once he gets out of his car, too.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.280
Is that so? Is it cool to
be able to drive a car well?

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.900
That's a definite yes.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.000
When it comes to a guy 
I don't think his looks matter.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.900
Any guy who's the best in his field

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.280
is always popular no 
matter what he looks like.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.500
Do you think so too, Mako?

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:53.900
Huh?

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.000
Not again. She's pretty
cunning behind the scenes.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.550
Mako is head over heels for fast drivers.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.460
She had a secret crush 
on a guy like that before.

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.880
Hey, don't get carried
away too much, or I'll kill you.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.900
But it was true.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.000
She did?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.000
(Hey, you're blushing)

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:22.880
Her joke aside, have you ever seen a race in the circuit before, Shinji?

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.900
A handful of chosen drivers, who race
in front of crowds, are admired heroes.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.000
Admired heroes?

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:41.030
The four drivers who are competing in this stage today are truly special to us.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:49.240
They're even more awesome than the 
professional drivers who race in the circuit.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:07.000
The idea of enjoying driving
varies according to the driver's skills.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:14.050
In my Zero theory, enjoyment is 
only attained by high level drivers.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:23.070
Those who regard adrenaline pumping risky 
situations as enjoyment are still low level drivers.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:30.410
You can relax your mind under pressure and tension
only when you have the skills to control various factors.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:35.380
Don't you think that such a relaxed 
mental state is synonymous with enjoyment?

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:44.000
Conversely, if your mind is not relaxed, your brain can't function at its best.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:52.700
I think, to a lesser extent, it's similar to a top
athlete's ability to reach a special mental state.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.640
I don't know what to say.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.410
Ikeda, you're a nice guy, but your problem is your over philosophical character.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.190
I can almost smell the incense,
probably because you're a monk.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.300
Well, excuse me for
smelling like incense.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.000
Your Zero theory is very well constructed

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.170
but what I wanted to tell
Gou was a little different.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.430
They just passed hairpin 3.
The gap is negligible.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.000
I wanted to remind him of...

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.930
I have a hunch of where
you're going to make your spurt.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.120
As a local driver, I know too much about this course, which makes me blind to simple things.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.380
It's so simple.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.950
eagerness to defeat the
opponent right before his eyes

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.350
and also a strong fighting spirit 
backed by the confidence of not losing.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.790
Call me childish, but that's the 
basics of street racing, isn't it?

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:30.680
You think adrenaline is bad, but I disagree.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.000
It's fundamentally different from
risky maneuvers by amateurs.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.000
Because they possess such high skills

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:49.000
they were done with course strategy and vehicle tuning even before the race began.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:54.000
After it begins, they just
have to be eager to win.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.590
Today, the higher the 
blood adrenaline level the better.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.150
"Blood adrenaline level." 
You sound like a physician.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.100
I can almost smell the antiseptic.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.570
Still, it's too risky.
I don't like it.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:13.700
It can't be helped.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.730
That's what a mountain pass is all about, and that's how you enjoy it.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.150
There!

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.650
Amazing.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.100
What happened?

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.200
Gou looked different.
He was never like that before.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.170
His red car looked excited.
That's never happened before.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.960
Are you crying, Mako?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.000
I don't know why,
but I'm so moved.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.600
It felt like something traveled through the air.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.740
Both drivers are amazing.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.280
What's this feeling?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.280
Am I envious?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.260
Can I impress Mako so much
that she has to shed tears?

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.450
I want to drive like that.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.800
This must be it. It's the point where I made my move in the first run.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.140
It's the simplest and easiest answer.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.870
I'm going to use all the 
strength I've been saving.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.540
Let's begin our battle, Hojo Gou!

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.450
I knew it.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.630
I feel very much like,
"Do your best and leave the rest."

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:26.900
I've done everything I could, 
so drive as you see fit.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.650
You outgrew me a long time ago.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.200
From here, your strength
will be put to the test.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.800
Go for it, Keisuke.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.840
Incredible.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.800
Is that the sound of the car 
slicing through the air?!

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.380
I've never heard it on a mountain pass before, but the sheer speed gave me chills.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.190
That FD is wicked. It's sick.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.560
I've got the intermediate time
from section 4. Have a look.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.500
This is bad. It's too fast.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.000
They're using their cars'
 potential beyond the preset limits.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.800
We shouldn't maintain this pace in a course without any escape zone.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.500
Hojo, you only have one life.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.790
When it comes to a street fight, Project D is a notch above us because they have more experience.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.070
Our strategy was to race
without reaching that level.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.500
If we could fight this battle as a 
motor sport, we would be superior.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.300
Don't get overeager.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.000
Our opponent is struggling just as much.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.540
He can't maintain such a pace for long.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:18.550
This is fun.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.850
It's not about logic.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:27.300
You can't just allow your
opponent to pull away.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.650
If I see a car trying to 
outrun me, I must chase it.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:33.300
That's only natural.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.900
It makes my blood boil.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.650
They're incredible. 
They give me the chills.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.000
It's like a fist fight.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:57.900
Their exit lines at full throttle are closer to the outer edge by a few centimeters compared to their previous run.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.350
If they continue fighting like that, 
they could lose control at any time.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.850
Their concentration won't last forever.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.980
I hope this won't end in tragedy.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.620
But for some reason, I'm a little envious.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.450
Same here.
I'm deeply impressed.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.450
They look awesome, don't they?

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.900
There's no doubt I share
the same DNA as theirs.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.650
It's the stubbornness and pride of 
simply hating to lose in a sprint race.

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.400
Without it, we wouldn't be
racing in the first place.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.600
I want to race so bad.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.450
I want to jump into 
that high tension race.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.990
The view is different from usual.
I'm going at an extraordinary pace.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.430
I can't stop. How can
I quit having this much fun?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.600
He's fast.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.650
Not only is my car under steering, 
but it's over steering as well?!

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.120
I've never worn the front tires 
so much in a hill climb before.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.410
He must have the same problem.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.380
Dammit!

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.900
Warming up already?

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.290
The hill climb hasn't ended yet.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.650
If they can't settle the match in this second run, there will be a third.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.020
Don't be in such a hurry, just relax.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:08.900
Right, but I don't think 
there will be a third run.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.050
It will be over in this second run.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.030
Fujiwara, your prediction sounds 
convincing, but why do you think so?

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.650
Keisuke's in excellent condition.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.290
I can feel it because
we practice together.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:29.730
I always thought he was great, but he's extraordinary this weekend.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:37.450
We're not pros, so our driving precision 
varies by our physical condition at the time.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.450
He raised his condition to the highest at this critical moment. That's impressive.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.000
You're observant as usual.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.740
I think our opponent
is an impressive driver.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.560
But Keisuke is better at the current moment.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:57.260
I'm glad he's not my opponent.
He gives off a dangerous aura.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.220
I can gain on him a bit if I can go
flat out for 3 seconds or longer.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:16.840
I have to shed every tenth of a second I can in order to maintain the gap.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.700
There's a flat out segment of
4 seconds after that curve.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.860
I must take every opportunity one by one.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.720
Is my entry speed too fast?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.050
No, I've gotta go for it.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.500
Swing the tail a bit,
and use four wheel drift.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.550
Step on it. I can't even
lose a tenth of a second.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.600
I have to keep on pushing, or I'll fall behind.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.000
I have to push it.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.450
Mako, Sayuki, I have to go.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.200
Go? Where?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.650
The best part of the
 show is about to begin.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.340
Why don't we watch the
down hill race from here together?

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.350
No, I...

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.060
I must go.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.770
What's wrong with him?

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.940
Don't know.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.780
We won!

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.700
It's awesome, just awesome.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.370
Just like Takahashi Keisuke.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.700
He's in a class by himself!

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.110
Now Takumi, you should win, too!

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.800
They've done so well that
the outcome is meaningless.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.400
The stopwatch doesn't lie.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.400
The car I built must have been possessed by something. It's like a miracle.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.870
I've been in the biz for a long time, 
but this is some kind of culture shock.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:26.700
Humans are incredible.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.800
Mako, please watch me from here.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.300
I might defeat Fujiwara Takumi.

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.500
What is that supposed to mean?

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.000
Could Shinji be?

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:02.410
No way!

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:19.150 line:50 %
Fujiwara Takumi

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:19.150 line:50 %
vs

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:19.150 line:50 %
Inui Shinji

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:19.150
The final battle has begun...!

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
