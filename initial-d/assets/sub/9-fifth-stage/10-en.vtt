Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.850
Ryosuke

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.650
What's going on?

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.300
The Grim Reaper is acting strange,
showing true hostile intent.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.810
The other guy is well aware of it,
but he isn't even trying to escape.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.600
This is no ordinary battle.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.540
It looks like I ran into
an extraordinary situation.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.030
Just like you, Ryosuke.
Your earlier hesitation is gone.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.950
You've got incredible adaptability.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.700
You're a much better
driver than I expected.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.290
Are you nearby, Kaori, watching us?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.700
I dedicate this battle to you.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.200
Even if I die here tonight, I won't regret it.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.800
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.550
No one can escape the Grim Reaper.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.700
That car is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.130
outrageously fast.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.200
Is he going to do it?

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.090
For real?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.220
Act 10  [ Full Stop ]

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.610
According to Takumi, that white FC doesn't
sound like Takahashi Ryosuke's car.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.760
So, it's just a Takahashi Ryosuke fan?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.520
I only heard it from the guy 
who caught a glimpse of it.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.800
Come to think of it,
 he said the car had a wing.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.510
Then it's someone else's.
Takahashi Ryosuke's FC has the stock one.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.400
You're right.
It must be someone else, then.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.300
Even though he's retired,
he still has hardcore fans.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.700
As expected of Takahashi Ryosuke,
Akagi's White Comet.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.000
I'm so envious.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.020
I wish I could be like him.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.560
That's impossible in terms
of looks, brains, and money.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.000
You're finished, Ryosuke.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.870
Disappear.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.440
No, don't do it!

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.000
That's insane!

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.300
Taking advantage of the ATTESA E-TS 4WD system,
he pushed from the side while accelerating.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.090
No one stands a chance 
against that heavy body.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.400
The Rotary Meister, who used to be known
as the best of the northern Kanto area

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.510
will perish in the mountain passes of Hakone.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.810
Take him, Kaori.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.430
What the hell?!

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.600
Damn, he climbed up the
slope as if it was a bank.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.600
Impossible.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.970
I can't believe what I just saw.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.550
If he forced the car
to stay on the road

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.290
it would have hit the curb and
bounced back uncontrollably.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.160
He aimed straight for the slope,
instead of trying to recover.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.400
It was a split second decision. It would
have been too late if he tried to think about it.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.830
He's even more of a natural than
that downhiller, Fujiwara Takumi.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.370
You have strong luck,
but how long will it last?

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.200
Is that all you've got, Senpai?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.000
I won't run or hide.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.860
I won't lose that easily

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.860
so throw everything you've
got at me, Hojo Rin.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.500
What's wrong, Takumi?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.210
You spaced out again.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.500
Oh, I'm concerned about that phone call.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.500
About an impersonator?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.480
Sorry, but can I make a phone call?

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.700
Sure, no need to worry about that.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.000
Thanks. I'll be back in a bit.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.800
Hello?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.720
Oh, Fujiwara, what's up 
at this time of night?

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.940
Oh, about that...

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.440
Sounds like it's Ryosuke's car.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.000
No, you don't have to worry.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.210
We don't know where he is, or what he's doing.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.550
I'll hand you over to Keisuke.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.000
Hello, Fujiwara? Listen.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.500
You don't have to worry about my brother.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.510
He's not so weak that he 
needs you to worry about him.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.000
Don't worry about this, and just focus
on preparations for the final battle.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.630
This isn't the time to be
goofing around with a girl.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.200
Trust my brother, and don't worry so much.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.370
Okay.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.010
Later.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.460
Dammit..

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.540
I can't say.
It has nothing to do with you.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.260
But I can't be satisfied until you tell me.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.770
You love someone else, don't you?

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.200
Tell me the name of the
guy who took you from me.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.210
Who is he?

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.180
Dad

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.840
How could you be so selfish?

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.450
Are you going to destroy everything?

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.910
Everything from my company's
existence to your carefree college life

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.400
is owed to Director Hojo.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.580
You know that, don't you?

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.700
Change your clothes, Kaori.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.210
We're going to visit him and apologize.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.410
If we apologize sincerely,
the Director should forgive us.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.620
I've talked to Rin, and he had the same idea.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.460
No, I won't go.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.900
Enough is enough!
How much are you going to trouble me?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.100
Please listen to me.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.100
This is for you, too.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.960
You have no other choice.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.350
I don't want to go, Dad.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.050
I don't want to go,
even if I have to die.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:54.920
Ryosuke

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.640
The RB26 is impressive. 
It must be making at least 650 HP.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.210
I'll be out accelerated
on a long straightaway.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.700
Sorry, Ryosuke.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.890
This time, there's nowhere to run.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.300
How pathetic.
I can't do anything.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.770
All I can do is watch?!

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.650
This time there's no bank to climb.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.040
Beyond the guard rail is a cliff.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.350
He recovered?

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.240
The Grim Reaper's fatal 
side press didn't work?

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.360
What just happened?

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.310
Oh, I know.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.000
The speed.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.380
The FC's cornering speed is very fast.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.200
The side press was believed to be
inescapable, but it was completely nullified.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:44.140
He dodged my attack by releasing
the side G-force to absorb the impact.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.700
Why can't I shoot Ryosuke down?

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.400
If you follow the basics of slow in and fast out,
you'll become a victim of the Grim Reaper.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.890
You sacrificed the exit speed
for a high speed approach.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.850
On top of that, he sees his
opponent's moves very well.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.180
He's so strong minded that he
doesn't flinch at dire circumstances.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:15.000
Instead of resisting, he remains open
to fear and anger, and lets them go by.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.800
That's the ideal Zero mindset
I've been trying to achieve.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.620
He's shown me something I don't have.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.500
You're incredible, Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.990
No matter how fast the Grim Reaper's car is,
he's no match for you in a normal race.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.000
Their mindsets are totally different, and the
Grim Reaper looks noticeably impatient.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.850
That's why, with the GT-R still trailing
behind, the situation is even more dire.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:59.900
I've never met Hojo Gou of Sidewinder, but
Hojo Rin was three years senior to me in college.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.650
I want to save Hojo Rin, because
both of us suffer from the same pain.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:11.300
That's why I can't run away,
and must face this head on.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.500
I have to do it for my own sake.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.470
The Hojo Rin I knew was sensitive and smart.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:28.600
He knew everything, but couldn't
accept it, so he shut himself in.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.200
He just needs a chance, and I believe in him.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.200
Words are convenient, but powerless.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.400
Sometimes you can convey a message
through means other than words.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.430
What you said is very complex.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.780
Besides, I don't understand why it has to be now.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:58.970
Since they're brothers, Sidewinder and the Grim 
Reaper might be collaborating behind the scenes.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.000
This could be a trap in order to gain
an advantage in the final Kanagawa battle.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.790
That's not likely, Matsumoto.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.420
How can you be so sure?

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:17.110
Hojo Rin picked this date
for a reason, an obvious one.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.860
Today's the second anniversary of Kaori's death.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.760
It's only been two years.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.310
What I can't stand is that 
you've recovered and moved on.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:41.400
How can you be so cold hearted?
Was it so easy for you to forget?

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.580
That's the extent of your feelings for Kaori?

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.610
No

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:59.710
You shouldn't let the depth of the scar, depth of sadness,
or the intensity of your despair keep you from moving forward.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.550
No matter how strong the pain is, 
it's our duty to move forward.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.510
You're wrong for running away from reality.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.200
Shut up, Ryosuke!

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.500
You're the one who's running away!

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.190
Both of us are responsible for Kaori's suicide!

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:26.230
Don't forget that, Ryosuke. 
I'll never let you forget that!

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.100
I haven't forgotten, nor run away.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.600
It has never escaped my mind.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.990
That's why I made my
choice to move forward.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.550
You think she wishes for
us to keep fighting like this?

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.270
This will only make her sad!

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.630
Why can't you understand this, Hojo?

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.300
Please, snap out of it.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:17:01.110
If you intend to drive me into despair, 
I'll wake you up for her sake.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.500
Crap.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.000
He's checking the brakes 
effectiveness far too often.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.900
Is the pedal feeling weird?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.170
Is there something wrong with the GT-R's brakes?

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:31.000
I just wished she were alive and well.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:39.520
Kaori, you're the best woman I ever 
met, no matter what others say.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.540
Even if you're not mine, so long 
as you're happy, I'd be alright.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.300
Soft hair, a breathtaking gaze

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.000
translucent white skin

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:00.170
slim body, and gentle curves.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.690
To me, you're like a work of art.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.070
But you're not here anymore.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.750
My god, what a nasty side press!

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:26.700
Instead of thrusting out the nose, he put his
car's body against the other to push it out.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.690
This is not a matter of dodging or not.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.700
You can't be serious, Grim Reaper!

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.290
You're on the bridge over the valley!

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.400
He hit the brakes to pull the nose out!

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.960
Both cars will lose control at the same time!

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.330
This is furious.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.300
The under steered GT-R hit the curb

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.200
while the over steered FC crossed
the line with full counter steering.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.050
No doubt, this is a deadly dogfight.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:19.000
But I've been witnessing a beautiful exchange
of splendid skills over and over again.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.460
How I pity you, Grim Reaper.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.090
With such skills, why do you have to turn
your precious car into a lethal weapon?

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.170
I can't get him even if I attack that hard?

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.680
You're foolishly honest,
despite your looks, Ryosuke.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.390
Are you trying to play along with me?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:43.890
For what? For whom?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:50.400
Again! Something's wrong.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.960
The braking distance is getting longer.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.800
It's fatal to have a brake problem 
on the downhill of this course.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.360
So why is your foot still on 
the gas in these circumstances?!

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:12.660
What is your dream, Ryosuke?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.790
To become a good doctor?

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:21.810
Sounds good, and I admire it, but

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.260
you can hardly call it a dream.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260
It's just a practical goal.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.670
I think men should be eager to chase dreams.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.760
Mine?

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.760
Girls are different.
I can live with practical goals.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.100
I'm not strong enough to turn away
from reality to pursue my dream.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:51.240
I think men have the privilege 
of being able to chase dreams.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:58.420
I wish I could keep watching
it with the person I love.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.470
Dream...

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:17.310
What terrible under steering.
The front tires have no grip.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.850
The brakes are even worse than that.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.000
This is unexpected.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.200
I never thought this game would last this long.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.960
This downhill puts more stress
on the brakes than the circuit.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:44.300
There's one more emergency 
escape area beyond the next corner.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.950
If you can't stop, use it, Grim Reaper.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.100
You've done enough!

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.340
Now, use it.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.700
You idiot!

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.660
The GT-R's pace is strange.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.660
The possible cause is the brakes.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.830
Damn, what should I do?

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.840
I'm disappointed in you, Kaori.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.650
Do whatever you want.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.720
This whole thing has displeased
both my father and me.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.000
You'll regret it later.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:42.540
I hate to say this, but your father's
business will suffer from now on.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.670
Someday, you'll regret 
that you didn't choose me.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.070
It didn't have any deep meaning.

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.200
I couldn't help saying such a foolish
thing because I was so frustrated.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.420
Kaori, was it me who
drove you into a corner?

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.900
It slid outward that much even
though it had an inside line.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.350
It may have lost most
of its braking potential.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:23.400
All that's left is for the Grim
Reaper to launch a suicide attack.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.240
Run, Takahashi Ryosuke. Shake him off.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.520
I'm afraid the Grim Reaper has lost his mind.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.800
You don't have to continue playing his
game. Get out of his attack range.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.490
Why did you release the accelerator
way before the braking point?!

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.680
Why did you slow down here?!

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.200
What the?!

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.680
What're you doing, Ryosuke?!

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:03.760
You can't stop the heavy body of the R32.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.920
My brakes are completely gone.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.860
Your FC's brakes can't
take the weight of two cars!

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.580
Goodbye, Ryosuke.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.300
What are you talking about?
Kaori, where are you now?

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:33.340
Thank you for everything.
Although it was brief, I had fun.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.450
Tell me where you are.
I'll be right there.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.120
I'm glad I met you, Ryosuke.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.540
Goodbye.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.710
It's so hard to maintain control
because the two cars are misaligned.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.800
It's an unrecoverable mistake.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.900
I can't get the maximum braking ability.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.150
It's no good, we aren't slowing down.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.310
I can't stop!

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
