Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.640
It's so hard to maintain control
because the two cars are misaligned.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.290
It's an unrecoverable mistake.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.320
I can't get the maximum braking ability.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.300
It's no good, we aren't slowing down.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.100
I can't stop!

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.820
I'm not going to let you
do all of it by yourself.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.890
I'm so impressed! Let me help!

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.100
Act 11  [ Full Stop, And Beyond... ]

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.450
You guys... what are you?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.480
This

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.590
isn't my imagination.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.550
She's here.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.300
Kaori is here.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.850
Kaori is...

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.100
Kaori was here.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.120
Did you sense it, Ryosuke?

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.650
I did.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.730
It was the scent of the
perfume she always wore.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.200
I shouldn't be able to
smell it in a place like this

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.610
but it suddenly entered
my car before the toll booth.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.260
I intuitively realized Kaori was there.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.250
Senpai, we must have
encountered some kind of miracle.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.470
Today's her anniversary.
It must be Kaori who saved you.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.000
Ryosuke, are you stupid?

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.710
I had solid hostile intent
as I drove behind you.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.500
You would've been a murder
victim if the worst happened.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.240
How can you sound so nonchalant, as if it happened to someone else?

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.900
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.660
We just had a "battle."

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.650
It would've been easy to
kill me if you were serious

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.700
but it didn't turn out that way

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.200
because you followed your own rules.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.990
That's why I accepted your challenge.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.890
We threw everything we had into it,
and now both of us are standing here.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.020
The fact that you were the opponent for my last
street battle means more than anything else to me.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.090
It was you who taught me the
joy of driving the mountain pass.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.290
I was able to drive so well with you watching,
so I'm satisfied from the bottom of my heart.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.270
That's more than enough for me.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.440
Let's put an end to this.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.300
I couldn't figure out why, no matter
how hard I tried. It was just painful.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.590
I blamed myself every day, and spent a
countless number of sleepless nights.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.700
Only the negative images filled my mind.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.050
But tonight, after racing with you, I feel like
something inside me was finally able to let go.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.560
It was probably because I was able
to express my feelings to the fullest.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.260
And you responded.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.650
Your message was loud and clear,
and stronger than any words.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.500
I realized so well that you've
been suffering from the same pain.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.790
I'm sorry, Ryosuke. Thank you for this.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.410
You could have ignored me, but you came.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.650
I'm satisfied having raced with you.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.710
I can say that from the bottom of my heart.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.970
Your precious car is scratched up so badly.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.910
Sorry, but it was unavoidable.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.990
I can imagine how difficult the situation
was just by examining those scratches.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.890
I'm not going to say much.
I'm just glad you made it back safely.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.000
That's the Takahashi Ryosuke I know.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.610
Well done.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:09.060
I feel like I was able to get
over a lot of things by racing him.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.940
It was a battle for my own sake, too.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.680
Something's changed.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.460
Ryosuke's facial expression is different.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.740
He looks better, as if he feels refreshed.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.340
As a team leader who sends
two drivers into battle

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.880
I must always know the reality of
what it's like to fight on the frontline.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.700
What's most frightening is
becoming less sensitive to it.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:42.540
But I was able to reassure myself
about my insight before the final battle.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.810
I've done everything I could for
the riskiest stage in Kanagawa.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.950
Our double aces have already surpassed me.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.400
They should be fine.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.600
One more battle to go.
Let's do our best to win.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:10.160
One week until Project D's
final battle in Kanagawa.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.080
I wonder what sort of driver
Sidewinder's downhiller is.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.540
I'm also curious about what
kind of car he's going to drive.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.120
Well, whoever he is,
he'll be no match for Takumi.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.350
That's what I think, too.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:29.000
But remember Kenji mumbling about something
just when the Kanagawa battles started?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.200
I'm afraid of a driver who's
specialized in a particular course.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.770
The kind of driver like Takumi
who won race after race on Akina.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.360
That's impossible.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.630
Takumi's one of a kind, because he didn't
grow up in an ordinary family.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.260
Parents have to be
eccentric for that to happen.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.640
Well that's...

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.900
He's a natural racer with a
special environment and talent.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.300
You honestly think there's another
strange family like them in Kanagawa?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.310
Probably not.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.960
Here comes that "slightly loud" car.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.320
You're still wearing your uniform, Mika?

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.530
Yep. I didn't have time
to go home and change.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.250
It's not that uncommon, right?

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.270
I mean, up until last year
you were wearing one, too.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.700
Do I look good in the sailor style uniform?

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.000
You came to realize your girlfriend
is a high school girl, didn't you?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.600
Well yeah, but you won't be
able to play golf that way.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.430
No worries, because I'm your coach today.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.250
To the right again.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.090
It goes to the right no matter what I do.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.050
It does curve, but you've improved, Takumi.

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.300
You're totally different from the first time.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.860
Even a skinny guy has some muscle, after all.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:43.300
Maybe. I think my arms are strong
because of the Eight-Six's steering.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.900
It's so heavy.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.400
It curves like that because you put
too much strength in your right arm.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.610
Let me use your club for a sec.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:56.700
When the club is in this position,
the face should look like this.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.500
I don't really understand.
Can you show me how?

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.800
Well then, watch me from behind.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.300
Like this

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.900
and just lift the club naturally.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.220
Mika

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.000
I'll do it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.520
You shouldn't.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.000
Iketani, Itsuki!

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.150
What's the matter, Kenji? You look upset.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.400
Did your grandma go missing again?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.700
Don't go and jinx us like that.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.910
I've got the latest info on
this weekend's race in Hakone.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.940
They're so secretive, that I don't know
much in detail, except for one thing.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.970
We didn't know anything about
Sidewinder's downhill driver, right?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.710
What do you know about him?

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.200
Actually, I don't know anything
about the driver himself

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.100
but apparently, his car is an Eight-Six.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.500
An Eight-Six?

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.730
Is it a Trueno or Levin?

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.390
I don't know that much yet.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:27.000
Besides, that's not important, is it?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.310
You're absolutely correct.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.040
Eight-Six versus Eight-Six, huh?

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:40.250
It's fortunate because Takumi won't
lose, if both cars are Eight-Sixes.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.540
There shouldn't be any other Eight-Six
drivers who are better than Takumi.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.800
I was nervous, not knowing what the
opponent's car was, but now I feel relieved.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.400
Once Takumi engages in a fight of
driving technique, he'll win for sure.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.000
It's too naive to simplify
the matter like that, Itsuki.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.800
I feel the same way.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.540
I've a bad feeling because it's so ominous

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:08.950
for Sidewinder, which is the best
in Kanagawa, to use an Eight-Six.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.830
It's a matter of confidence.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.940
They appear to have a very good strategist.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.600
I don't think he staged a battle between two
Eight-Sixes just to make the show more interesting.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.300
They must be doing
everything to counter Project D.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:33.550
Their choice of an Eight-Six as their final weapon to stop
Takumi's consecutive wins may be a sign of confidence.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:03.380
He drives so smoothly that he doesn't
leave any strong impression at all.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:09.550
But if you time him, he drives this downhill
faster than any of the Sidewinder members.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.940
Plus, he doesn't drive any other course.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.260
This world is full of strange talents.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.100
I wonder how a kid like
him acquired such skill.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.400
It's perplexing.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:28.200
It's something beyond the common notion
of what driving technique should be.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.320
Even Project D will be caught off guard.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.230
He got rid of his R32.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.340
Do you mean Rin?

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.200
Yes.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:50.610
I don't know what made him change.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:56.340
The Grim Reaper GT-R will
never appear in Hakone again.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.550
I don't know what happened to him

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.200
but I've heard that he's requested
to return his former position at work.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.100
It's good for the Hojo family, isn't it?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.780
Probably so, but it
doesn't mean anything to me.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.550
Little kids maybe, but we're not at the age where we can
just up and go back to being friendly siblings just like that.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.440
It's creepy for brothers
our age to be so clingy.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.550
Project D, my ass.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.550
I'll defeat you, Takahashi Keisuke.

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.400
How is the new setup?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.250
It feels good on Akagi's roads

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:42.250
but I can't say much until
we get some data in Hakone.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.930
I want to tackle the final stage real soon.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.650
I'm tired of image training.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.650
I'll circle the dates of my Hakone
expeditionary race on the calendar

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.650
so don't forget your
delivery dates, okay?

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.350
Got it.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.200
His tire management is impressive.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.650
But something bothers me.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.400
The control is too perfect.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.310
Keisuke, Fujiwara, come over here.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:56.730
As you know, this course is long, so it's physically
impossible to practice on everything in one day.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.220
So cut it to the bare minimum.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:05.250
Find what will become the key to victory as
you drive, then expand your scope from there.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.330
If you try to do everything,
it'll only be half finished.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.870
Imagine tomorrow's dogfight, and take a practical
strategy of knowing what to focus on and what not to.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.150
I'm sure both of you can do that.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.140
Then go.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.840
The course is so long that it'll take longer
than usual to complete their routine.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.250
I'm going to let them practice
thoroughly until dawn, so be prepared.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.300
Got it.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.200
I'll get more food
than usual for tonight.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.300
They say you can't fight
on an empty stomach.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.750
Thanks, Fumihiro.
I'm counting on you.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.770
Hey, Matsumoto, you
know something, don't you?

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.160
About what?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.270
About Ryosuke, of course.
He's acting differently.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.200
Well, it must be because
this is the final battle.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.450
I'm sure he's focused.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:13.630
No, that's not what I mean.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:19.630
It's like he's relaxed,
like he's smiling more often.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.910
Matsumoto, if you know something, tell me.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.200
Well

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.100
I don't know anything, really.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.550
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.840
What do you think, Kubo?

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.650
That FD is giving off a different feeling
from the last battle against Spiral.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.310
It might have been
modified a lot for this battle.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.100
I don't know.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.250
The outer appearance is different
because of the carbon fiber hood,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.760
but the insides shouldn't have changed much.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.700
I'm worried. Forget about the Eight-Six.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.410
Instruct everyone to focus
their data collection on the FD.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.450
If you say so, I'll do it

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.610
but are you sure about the Eight-Six?

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.790
Data is meaningless for Shinji's driving.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.900
He won't be able to make use of the data.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.550
Even if he doesn't have it, he'll still win.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.050
Shinji is that kind of driver.
Don't you think so too, Kubo?

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:21.300
You're right.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.010
Focus on the FD.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.570
Obtain as much information on its section times
to determine how its fighting potential varies.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.580
Alright, I'll arrange that.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:42.800
Oh man, our boss is nervous.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.290
He fell for our opponent's diversion strategy.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.700
They shouldn't have changed the
specs very drastically at this point.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.300
That FD is a completely balanced machine.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:01.280
I won't be tricked, Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.300
This is our match of intelligence.
You're worthy of being my opponent.

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.830
Hey, Mister Zero.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:20.080
Well, if it isn't the hot blooded 246 guy.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.400
It has finally come to the
moment of truth, hasn't it?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:28.160
I was expecting you to stop them.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.350
Sorry that we weren't good enough.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.650
Takahashi Keisuke

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.260
How do you rate him?

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:47.910
His accelerator technique on
a half wet road was exceptional.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:54.440
He managed to control the traction of the
rear tires, as if they were a part of his body.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.300
Besides his concentration right at the moment of attack,
his ability to switch mindsets quickly is also impressive.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:06.280
He reaches beyond the scope of Zero Theory,
like a fighter jet boosted by an afterburner.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.840
In other words, he's like you.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.700
Like me?

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:18.050
The type of driver who shows his eagerness for
victory, who has skills and understands the theory.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.760
But in the end, what
matters most is the spirit.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.100
You and Takahashi Keisuke
are alike on that account.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.830
I don't feel bad hearing that.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.450
What kind of driver is Fujiwara Takumi?

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:45.020
I want to hear your opinion since
you witnessed his true potential.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.700
It's difficult to describe him.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.470
It's like a black hole.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.300
Black hole?

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.210
He has a wide margin to be able to absorb a lot.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:03.090
He appears to have his own concrete policy, but in
reality, he has no color. He's transparent and flexible.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:11.250
He improves race after race, so he's probably
different from when he raced against me.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.350
So you think highly of him,
almost raving about him.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:20.520
Then what's your prediction for this
battle between Project D and Sidewinder?

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.400
You want to cut to
the point, don't you?

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.900
It's unfortunate

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.800
but Sidewinder will win.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:34.860
I've come to the same answer.
I really admire Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:41.500
As a member of a Kanagawa area team, I can't openly say
this, but my emotional side wants Project D to win.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.690
But that's impossible.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.900
Sidewinder had plenty of time to prepare.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.320
As long as they have Kubo Eiji as their
strategist, they don't have any weaknesses.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.900
But you can't really tell
until they start racing.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.610
It's not like Project D
has no chance of winning.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:01.550
They have a slight chance due
to their drivers improvements.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:08.650
I say their chance of winning
is one fifth, which is 20%.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.380
This is getting ridiculous.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:18.650
I've never seen so many
guys with stopwatches before.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.980
Don't they have anything else to do?

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:27.220
Speaking of which, we aren't that different, coming
all the way from Gunma only to race in Hakone.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.650
Well, that's true.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.360
They're measuring my
section times pretty closely.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.500
I don't like them trying
to figure out our strategy.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.900
Should I add another camouflage pattern?

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.100
No, don't.
Just do as normal.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.540
I'm afraid that you won't finish
practice if you try to do it differently.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.100
At this point, we don't
have to modify our style.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.600
I got it.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:02.170
I'll let them watch and learn the style of
Project D, the best of the northern Kanto area.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:04.590
Yup, that's exactly what I meant.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:07.490
What should I do then?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:10.990
Set the suspension to pattern C,
and add 10 liters of gas.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.800
Did you notice a huge number
of scouts throughout the course?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.850
Keisuke told me about them,
and tons of stopwatches, too.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.510
Here you go.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.300
There're quite a lot of people out there,
but they aren't pushing the buttons.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.820
I noticed those who were keeping
time and taking notes from the first round.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.450
I'm sure they're the same people.
I remember some of their faces.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.080
But today none of them pressed
the button on their stopwatches.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.430
Are you sure, Fujiwara?

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.000
Yes.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.000
He noticed such small
details while he was driving.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.500
That's what makes him so great.

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.810
But what's the meaning of this, Ryosuke?
It contradicts what Keisuke said.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.650
That's fine. Both of
them are telling the truth.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.880
It's going as planned.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:18.350 line:50 %
And so, the day of the final battle in Kanagawa has arrived...

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
