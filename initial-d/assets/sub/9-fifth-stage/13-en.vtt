Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.450
Here they come!

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.660
Why? What made them so excited?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.860
What's your take, Mako?

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.010
Hard to say, but at the least 
the NSX's traction is impressive.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.400
The exit of this corner is really steep, but it 
accelerated quickly without losing balance.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.400
The FD is at a disadvantage after all, 
because its response was one step behind.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.200
Hojo's red car wasn't having fun.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.270
But the yellow car was smiling.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.550
But I knew early on that our
opponent would be using an NSX.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.340
It's not like Keisuke and I just 
sat back and waited for today.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.510
We have our own trump card.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.300
They passed the hairpin at the observatory, and have entered section 4.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.450
From there...

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.650
It's begun.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.150
I can't conserve the tires from here on, but I'm counting on you, my FD.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.180
Please hold on.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.580
It's so frustrating!
How is the battle going?!

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.380
Calm down, Itsuki.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.600
But I'm so worried 
that I can't stand still!

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.900
They're probably maintaining
their positions at the moment.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.150
The NSX tries to flee while
the FD tries to catch it.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.120
Right.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.840
But do you really think the FD can win?

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.970
What are you saying, Kenji?

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.250
You saw it, didn't you?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.070
That speed was incomparable.
Besides, it's in the lead position.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.950
Takahashi Keisuke will win no matter what 
because he's Project D's ace in the hill climb!

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.460
Same for Takumi.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.250
They're in section 4.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.000
Everything has gone as planned so far.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.200
The real battle begins now.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.630
Act 13  [ Battle Beyond Expectations ]

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.250
Matsumoto, I couldn't tell you this until now

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.780
but I hesitated to pick Keisuke
as a driver for Project D.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.240
There was a time when he looked inferior, when
compared to Fujiwara with his splendid talent.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.860
Keisuke must have felt it,
more or less, as well.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.080
Drivers naturally figure those things out.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.330
He must have felt a certain degree of pressure.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.840
As for me, I didn't want to
favor my blood related brother.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.900
That's why I've been trying to distance myself from him, and acted harshly.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.900
Yes, you have.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:02.490
I remember when Keisuke damaged his car's suspension after going through some oil during our Saitama expeditionary race.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.900
Dammit!

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.040
This pisses me off!

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.800
You have no time to vent 
your frustration on the guardrail.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.050
It's your fault that your FD was damaged.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.140
My fault?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.500
Yes. I wouldn't have damaged 
my car because of a trap like this.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.950
Your overconfidence and
carelessness brought you to this.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.860
Calm down and think.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.000
You blamed Keisuke for his carelessness, instead of our opponent's dirty trick.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.060
I felt sorry for him.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.300
He's been pretty tough since he was little.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.380
He improves more from getting 
chewed out than from receiving praise.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.960
It was around that time when the
look in his eyes began to change.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:34.930
Regarding the training of having Keisuke match a preset time, I was obsessed with the same training a long time ago.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.720
Surprisingly, you don't learn much when you're desperate and trying to drive fast.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.630
Your concentration doesn't last,
and you'll only put stress your car.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:55.270
But you think hard and discover 
more by practicing car control.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.890
You can reach your limit only
 after you perfect such control.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.500
I've got the section time.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.800
It's nearly Gou's best time.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.650
None of the Sidewinder team 
members could keep up with this pace.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.940
Takahashi Keisuke is the real thing.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:25.760
There are a lot of spectators, but not very
many of them truly understand what's going on.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.300
At a glance, the situation 
appears to be deadlocked

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.600
but both drivers are managing
their tires extremely well.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.650
A high level race that appeals to
 the experts tends to look uneventful.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.650
Fujiwara is a typical example.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.570
He's a master of vehicle control.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.810
You're right.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.950
You could say that Keisuke's sense 
of rivalry with Fujiwara improved him.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:07.000
Whether it's heavy rain or fog, even when he was sick, he never skipped his driving training on Akagi roads.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.700
Some say a never ending passion
is what brilliance is all about

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.580
and Keisuke has something like that.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.450
Fujiwara and Keisuke are 
mutually beneficial to one another.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:26.540
To be honest, Matsumoto, this past month.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.900
Actually, in the past 
two weeks to be precise

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.710
Keisuke has reached an incredible level.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.950
An incredible level?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.500
His time is dead accurate to the preset time.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:58.810
Even when he faces obstacles that might 
disrupt his pace, he matches the time in the end.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.000
He must have developed 
an accurate internal clock.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.080
My past peak performance
wouldn't beat today's Keisuke.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:17.000
I did the same training, so I can
 understand how impressive he is.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's godlike to drive such a long Akagi road 
within an error margin of less than 1 second.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.000
Many factors have contributed
 to Keisuke's breakthrough.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:37.040
My training method created
 an incredible street racer.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.910
His condition is extremely good.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.590
What a pleasant surprise.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.650
We made it time for the final battle.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.390
Our trump card is Keisuke himself.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.690
Kogashiwa, what's your impression
of the NSX's performance?

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:30.550
To me, it only looks like it's
 desperately trying to go fast.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.650
It's going flat out, and 
the tires are at their limit.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.960
More than anything, the lines
 show the driver's seriousness.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.190
I agree.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.700
Then why is Takahashi 
Keisuke's FD right behind it?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.250
What's going on?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.310
This isn't what we discussed.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.120
Your car should have
 a 15 second advantage.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.160
Do you have any qualms with
 only a 15 second advantage?

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.280
It's enough.
Who do you think I am, Kubo?

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.550
Do you think I'll lose to some punk
from Gunma in driving technique?

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.880
This is really frustrating.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.440
Dammit, this sucks.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.300
Slim, long and beautiful legs.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.300
And she gives off a nice scent.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.200
Mako is a mature woman.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.510
Who would've anticipated a deadlock like this?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.960
This is really unexpected,
but things are getting interesting.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.650
Hojo Gou trying to settle
 the match, but he's failing.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.120
Project D is quite something indeed.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.650
There's not much left 
after this hairpin curve.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.010
This must be a surprising
turn of events for Sidewinder.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.400
I don't think they've prepared
 for a second or third run.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.650
That means Kubo Eiji made
 a mistake in building his strategy.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.000
Something else has happened behind the scenes.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.300
Something else...

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:02.900
What did you say?

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.400
That's ridiculous!
Do you have the section time?

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.380
Yes.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.550
That's

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.550
impossible.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.850
That FD isn't built to
match such a high pace.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.300
Was there a miscalculation?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.300
No, that can't be the case.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.550
The FD3S shouldn't have that kind of potential.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.060
Dammit!

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.200
Hey, what's happening?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.700
I was on a roll when I went flat out.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.000
I know I was.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.900
So why are you still there?

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.440
Why are you putting pressure on me,
 instead of falling behind?

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:22.900
Sidewinder tried to dominate us in intelligence gathering by dispatching scout teams since our first race in Kanagawa.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:29.500
Seasoned strategist Kubo's plan
 didn't work, probably because

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:40.000
Keisuke's skills, that are refined by his peculiar daily training, greatly exceeded Kubo's expectations.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.310
The type of driving sense he's acquired becomes useful in many ways.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.650
Even if you don't control
 your car at full throttle

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.700
you can understand how the car 
will behave at its max acceleration.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:59.910
Around the time when we began our Kanagawa races, Keisuke stopped practicing a flat out run.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.140
You can lean more that way.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.550
And more than anything, you can finish your 
car's settings because of improved efficiency.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.550
I see. That makes sense.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:18.360
Our opponent has a data analysis expert who can see through any imperfect camouflage.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.910
By focusing on the critical attacking areas, and going easy on the rest

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:28.970
we created an evened out pace, which should have 
made it difficult for our opponent to gauge our potential.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.290
On top of that, Keisuke drives extremely fast even when he takes it easy.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:40.140
Even Kubo couldn't anticipate a driver, who's 
trained on public roads, could pull such a stunt.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.360
It's beyond my imagination.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.150
They may have figured out 
how we control our cars

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:52.400
but we didn't give them any information
 about our peak performance.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.300
This battle of intelligence is even.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.390
Keisuke is amazing.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.450
Okay, I got it.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.650
The first hill climb is over, and the
 result is not what we expected.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.720
He failed to outrun him, which means the
game is carried over to the second run, right?

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.770
Yeah.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.100
That's the way it should be.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.950
I bet his brain is 
frozen like a glacier.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.900
But he has time to recover.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:41.630
He'll do better without annoying 
restraints, like strategies or pride.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.850
I see. 
I know what you mean.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.350
Something inside him
has to be awakened.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.900
That's all he needs in a game
of tag on a mountain pass.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.550
Remember the basics.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:01.200
A battle tends to be settled
by something very simple.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.510
I'm very sorry.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:19.340
You don't have to apologize. 
The car is in great condition.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.900
My instinct tells me that
I had a pretty good time.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.200
Am I wrong?

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.300
You're exactly right.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.650
You beat your own
section 4 record by 2 seconds.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.850
See?

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.650
I had good feedback.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.460
It's not like I lost.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.550
I'm struggling a little,
but I'll recover from here.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.010
I've got to pull myself together.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.970
Ready to go, Keisuke?

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:57.030
Anytime. I'll throw everything
I've got into this second run.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.950
If this drags on into a
third run, I'll definitely lose.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.400
You look like you're enjoying this, despite your desperate comment.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.020
I'm enjoying this from
the bottom of my heart.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.360
This could be my happiest 
moment since Project D began.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.700
Let's begin!

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.460
Five seconds till start!

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.510
Four

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.530
Three

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.740
Two

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.600
One

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.750
Go!

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.600
There won't be a third run. 
If there is, you'll lose.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.880
In any case, I'm proud of 
what you've achieved, Keisuke.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.000
This is breathtaking, isn't it?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.300
He was at a disadvantage in every aspect.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:34.160
Takahashi Keisuke was an incredible street racer even back then

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.230
but he turned out to be even
better than we imagined.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.650
Right.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:43.770
Like I said, Project D's double 
aces won't lose no matter what.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:51.230
But turbo charged cars tend to lose
 power over time because of heat soak.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:56.090
A longer race will negatively affect the FD.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.690
Takahashi Keisuke should know
that better than anyone else.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:05.040
I don't know where, but he'll make a spurt in the second half of the race.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:05.800
I agree.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.030
Here they come!

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:25.700
I'm going to get a kick out of Takahashi Keisuke's cannonball dash which has beaten a number of tough challengers.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.700
It's going to be epic in this final stage.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.060
I can't imagine what's gonna happen, or how the race will turn out.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.550
After all, both drivers are putting
their lives on the line to drive so fast.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.000
He's making it obvious that he's just cruising. He's not pushing it to the limit.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.670
Even so, he's still fast, and
maintaining a high speed pace.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.000
Nice execution.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.300
I didn't expect him to be
able to pull off such a move.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.740
I didn't realize he was so 
skillful until I drove behind him.


00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:27.020
That aside, his car seems so fun to drive.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.090
It's quite shocking to see a driver who can compete at this high of a level.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.570
Has my NSX ever looked
like that from the outside?

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.400
I'm being sucked in...

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.410
I'm being sucked in 
by this pleasant rhythm

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.220
and getting synchronized.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.990
I just don't get it.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.200
There are many FD3S's at time attack events between tuning shops.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.970
I've seen many time attack specialty 
FDs that looked like race cars.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:22.930
I thought I was well aware of that particular FD's strengths and weaknesses.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:27.200
I was confident that we'd
built a victory worthy NSX.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.690
I don't understand this.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.550
What do you think, Mr. Kubo?

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.690
You can never be certain about
the outcome of a competition.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:42.430
We were outsmarted in data collection, but it's still within our expectations.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:48.550
We ran our simulation with a reasonable margin, just in case. We're not stupid.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:56.330
Maybe not by 15 seconds, but our
car still has an absolute advantage.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.330
After all, unlike circuits, unexpected things happen on mountain passes.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:06.360
So far, our opponent is doing an excellent job.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.950
We haven't lost yet.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.000
This time, our leader will
turn the situation around.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.250
If he can manage this second run, there'll be no reason for us to lose.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.100
Nothing can shake our absolute advantage.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.810
This pleasant feeling will 
eventually come to an end.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.670
There'll be a moment when
it will switch to combat mode.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:37.320
He'll make a full throttle dash
like I did in the first run.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:44.570
If my NSX and I can't keep up 
with it, this battle will be over.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.600
Where? Where are you
going to make your move?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Even when night falls, the scenery remains unchanged.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.890
Looking back at the path I've taken.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.400
Sadness, happiness, incurable pains.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:03.200
Realizing that there are too many to count, as I walk alone.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.740
Countless number of memorable scenes.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.140
We lived through the hustle and bustle.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.480
Sometimes we argued, sometimes we understood.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.280
It wasn't always pretty, but I keep the truth to myself

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.210
as I take a new step.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.960
Rosy clouds embellish the city.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.990
I quietly ask about my future.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.760
The sky remains silent.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:36.100
Only illuminating this path before me.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.760
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.210
The setting sun plays a melody.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.220
Feel the translucent scenery.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.980
The setting sun plays a melody.
