Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.050
Are you Mr. Fujiwara of Project D?

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.170
That's dishonest and horrible!

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.680
What happened?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.350
Took the day off today.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.590
I took another shift for someone else.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.650
Comp time off, huh?

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.850
How did it go?
You're done with Ibaraki, right?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.300
Did you lose?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.290
I won.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.200
Then why do you look so gloomy?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.000
It's about something else.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.230
Who is this?

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.300
Hello?

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.690
Well, um... it's fine, but hold on.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.760
What's the matter?

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.960
A girl?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.800
Hello.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.210
I'm sorry for calling you so suddenly.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.600
I wanted to apologize to you earlier, but...

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.140
No, it's okay.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.400
How did you get my number?

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.200
I looked up the number for the gas station,
and when I called, an attendant gave me your number.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.300
I see.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.510
I'm so sorry for saying such awful things.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.360
You must be mad at me.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.000
No, I'm okay as long
as you know it wasn't me.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.250
I thought I should apologize
in person instead of calling you.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.380
but the days flew by before
I could make time to come visit you.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.000
I'm truly sorry.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.910
I'll find time to visit you.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:44.890
Well then.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.600
Um, what about me coming there?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.700
Eh?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.440
That's if you're okay with it.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.710
I don't mind driving
to your neighborhood.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.900
W-what am I saying?!

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.100
Are you sure, really?

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.180
Y-yeah.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.700
Act 2  [ New Battlefield ]

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.810
Thank you for coming all this way.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:49.750
To be honest, I was sort of relieved and glad when I realized that it wasn't you, after showing your picture to Tomoko.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.200
When I saw you for the first time,
you didn't look like a dishonest person.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.350
But you went pretty far, didn't you?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.800
I got carried away
because I was so furious.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.880
I'm really sorry.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.650
It must have hurt because
I work out in the club.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.900
What do you do?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.610
Golf.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.800
I've been practicing since I was little.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.800
I've got training camp and competitions, 
so my summer break is packed with training.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.170
So I couldn't come to Gunma.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm glad you came.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.300
I took my father's suggestion
and started to play golf.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.000
If I skip training, he gets mad.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.830
That sounds familiar.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.700
I was forced to learn how to
drive since I was in middle school.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:52.140
I hated it before, and we butted heads a lot, but
I eventually began to drive because I wanted to.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.880
I understand what you're saying so well.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.300
I argued with my dad all the time.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.850
But now golf is a part of my daily life.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:04.890
We're alike.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.460
What the hell?!

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.550
You went to Saitama to see her today?!

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.250
And what did you talk about?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.400
Nothing really.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.150
We just had tea in a family
restaurant for about an hour.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.800
What's her name?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.070
How old is she?

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.300
Her name is Uehara Mika, and she's a year 
younger than us, so she's a senior in high school.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.620
And what?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.280
Is she taken?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.410
Are you going to date her?

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.170
What?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.440
We didn't talk about anything like that.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.710
I'm not you.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.960
Why not?

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.890
That's the most important part, isn't it?

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.000
We couldn't talk much in
such a short period of time.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.100
It was really short.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.480
I'm gonna say this because it's you.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.530
I think I fell in love with
her the first time I saw her.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.600
I wish I could say that!

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.030
I'm so envious!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.850
I feel awkward.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.250
I don't know what
to do about this feeling.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.490
I don't get it.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.930
If you like her, you have to gather
your courage and make a move.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.200
But it could be one sided.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.970
She doesn't necessarily feel the same way.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.940
Sounds awfully timid for a driving genius.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.100
That has nothing to do with this.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.480
I'm not very confident.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.300
We'll counter Project D with four
carefully planned defensive lines.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:01.500
As a prelude to the battles in Hakone, we'll watch how our opponents race on this mountain path.

Team Spiral Leader - Ikeda Ryuji (Zero)

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.300
We'll assemble a data collection team
and completely expose their strategy.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.400
Let us take care of that.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.930
"If you know the enemy and know yourself,
you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.010
Information and data is
everything in today's racing.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.350
Do we really have to go that far?

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.050
I don't think our opponent is good enough for the
best three in Kanagawa to sneak around like this.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.600
In any case, I'll settle this during my turn.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.000
Sorry, but you guys won't
have a chance to compete.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.610
You sound quite confident.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.220
Alright, I look forward to it, then.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:04.000
That's quite an indirect and
hesitant strategy, isn't it?

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.680

Team 246 Driver - Kobayakawa

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.800
Sounds like the first team,
which is us, shouldn't win.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.250
So, should we deliberately lose and
 let the next team take the credit?

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.260
Oh, please.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.600
A fair and square win is the best.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.000
I'm pissed at those Sidewinder guys, too.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.100
We didn't ask them to manage this.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.500
We have no reason
to hold back for them.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.800
Show the true potential of 246.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.890
Amazing.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.400
She hits great distances without slicing.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.490
What happened, Mika?

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.970
I wonder what Takumi is doing now.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.000
Hey, Fujiwara, don't just space out.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.170
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.740
Big news, Iketani!

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.100

GOLF

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.080
What?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.560
A golf magazine?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.980
Here, take a look inside.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.440
That's her, right?

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.680
"A new star in women's golf"

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.440
"Uehara Mika, seventeen years old"?!

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.350
This is the girl who slapped Takumi?

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.170
I'm absolutely positive.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.050
She looked exactly like this.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:50.330
Man, if I'd known she was famous,
I would've asked for her autograph.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.650
A golf genius who hits
a white ball in the daylight

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.100
and a driving genius who
tackles the roads at night.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.650
Those are polar opposites, aren't they?

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.350
I wonder if this romance
will develop any further.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.710
This is downhill checkpoint 3.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.200
The Eight-Six just passed by.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.000
The FD just passed
hill climb checkpoint 7.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.060
How many years?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.270
It's been a long time,
hasn't it, Takahashi Ryosuke?

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.630
You seem to be having a hard time
because of the power increase.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.300
It can't be helped.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.990
After all, hill climbing is a power game.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.100
I have something else that worries me.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.760
I saw some guys with stopwatches
scattered throughout the course.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.160
Are they timing you?

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.750
Probably.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.300
I think it's pointless to check our times.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:24.000
We're still setting up our cars, and
we haven't mastered the course yet.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.850
The speeds will be totally
different during the actual race.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.300
But it bothers me that they're
checking our times every so often.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Okay.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.570
It's ready to go, Keisuke.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.750
Okay.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.200
Fujiwara seems to be in
good condition as usual.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.500
He appears to enjoy challenging
difficult courses like this.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.650
The car is tricky to drive in every
aspect, but he says it's easy.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.510
It makes me wonder if he's an alien.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.910
Is this okay, Ryosuke?

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:14.530
I'm sure an organized data collection
team is all over the course.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:19.400
Our cars pace will pick up in the later half.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:25.040
Anyone with a trained eye will be able to accurately measure our potential.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.790
Probably so.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.970
Shouldn't we think about using
some kind of camouflage?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.010
No, I'd rather not use any cheap tricks.

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.900
If they want data, they can
have it, for today that is.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.790
Don't worry, Fumihiro.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.680
I made my decision after careful thinking.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.290
One thing I can say is that the people
collecting data aren't our next opponents.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.480
Is that so?

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.620
Think about it.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.800
The battle is tomorrow.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.400
There's no time to set up
a car based on today's data.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.140
You're right.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.080
They must be an opponent
we're racing against much later.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.400
If so, we still have time.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.610
We must focus on the opponent before us.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.650
The first half is a series of steep uphill slopes.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.220
The second half is a continuous mild slope.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.000
Well, that's from the
hill-climbing perspective, so...

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.990
It's the opposite on the downhill.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.300
Yeah.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.440
But whether it's a hill-climb or downhill

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.550
the key to this course are the parts
 where the road width suddenly changes.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:50.400
There are many places where two lanes change into one throughout the course.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.750
Those will be important overtaking points.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.910
You're right.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.240
I know that in my head

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:11.170
but the locals must know how to benefit from it, and they won't drive on the unfavorable side.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.200
And if you aim for it, 
you might fall into a trap.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.810
Oh man, a Lan Evo again

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.180
How come my opponents always
seem to be driving 4WD cars?

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.680
I've had enough.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.460
Why don't you claim to 
be Akagi's Lan Evo killer?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.560
That doesn't even make a good joke.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.000
You can say that,
because you aren't driving.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.540
Frankly speaking, it's the car I hate to compete against the most on the mountain passes now.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.800
Because it's absurdly fast.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.590
They gave us the choice of
being the leader or the pursuer.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.460
Which do you want, Kobayakawa?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:04.750
I can be either, but I want to take
a close look at my opponent.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.750
I don't think I'll be outrun by a 2WD car

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.000
so the first race will be for recon,
and the second will be the real match.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.700
Okay, we'll go with that, then.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.700
I'm Kobayakawa.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.700
I'm Takahashi Keisuke.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:43.650
Since you're the leader, you know what to do without being told, don't you?

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.810
I know.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.630
Half of my job was finished yesterday.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.330
That's what you wanted
to say, right, Brother?

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.700
Correct.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.800
I'm counting on you.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.700
I'm going to count down!

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.350
Five

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:04.250
Four

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.330
Three

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.280
Two

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.330
One

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.300
Go!

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.100
Give me your best prediction
on how this battle will unfold.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.840
Best prediction?

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.050
That's tough at the moment.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.800
He's got power.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.900
Footwork's good, too.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.600
But the road will soon
become steep and rough.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.040
I'm curious as to how he'll handle it.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.090
I know you don't have enough data.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.480
That's why I said "prediction."

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.900
Once you have data, you're
correct 100% of the time.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.190
The road suddenly widens here, but it'll narrow soon.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.510
Well then, let me give you my prediction.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.600
Just a prediction, okay?

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.560
This is my prediction.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.760
Amazing.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.000
It's rare to see a rear-wheel-drive
car climbing the hill so sharply.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.560
But something's not right.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.710
I don't like the fact that the
car's behaving as it should.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.310
I don't feel any "plus factors."

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.100
The driver's presence is too weak.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.160
You're a fast driver, but still,
you're boring, Takahashi Keisuke.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.440
Omiya, what do you think
about Kobayakawa's decision?

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.330
I think his choice to be the 
pursuer for the first run is correct.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.860
Also, the road is very narrow.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.080
I don't see any disadvantage for
Kobayakawa, even if the race drags on.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:23.750
If he can figure out what makes him faster
and slower than his opponent in the first run

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.400
he can make a bold decisive
maneuver in the second run.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.620
Are you going to use the
same strategy, Omiya?

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.350
I don't know.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.170
I'll think about it after seeing
the results of the hill climb.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.440
Results?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.860
But Kobayakawa has an
absolute advantage, right?

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.850
His opponent is an FD.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.690
I don't like it when I have
an absolute advantage.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.650
You never know until it's over.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:04.140
He's good.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.700
He doesn't show any wasteful 
wheel spin even on this rough surface.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.010
Your perfectionism comes through loud and clear.

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.700
But your "doing your job right"
gets on my nerves.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.750
I got it.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.610
This's enough.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.600
It's not like your team has
outrageously skilled drivers.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:46.580
Lately, the conversations between you and Keisuke have the tendency to sound like Buddhist riddles.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:52.600
I don't understand what I'm hearing from
your side, like your advice before the start.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:58.100
What did Keisuke mean when he said
half of his job was finished yesterday?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.460
Oh, it's nothing.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.100
It doesn't have any complicated meaning.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.740
If you live with someone under the same roof, you can communicate without saying much.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.400
In principle, we've agreed to finish the race
quickly whenever we start in the lead position.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:26.700
The first half of this course is made of steep hills, so he
must preserve his tires while the FD is at a disadvantage.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:34.130
Then he can execute a super attack by making the best use
 of his tires in several high-speed sections on the second half.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.270
Halfway there.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.100
The slope will be milder
compared to the first half.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.400
He'll make a move somewhere.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.300
Where will it be?

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.730
It's the kind of simple and easy strategy that Keisuke would prefer, right?

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:52.500
It's obvious he'll lose his edge if he
challenges the Lan Evo to a long race.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.340
The key to victory is how much
more Keisuke can raise his top speed.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.480
That's what he meant when he said half of his job was finished during yesterday's practice.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.710
Where, dammit?

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.350
Where are you going
to make your move?

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:18.770
I know your strategy.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.880
When it comes to rapid acceleration, the Evo won't lose to any other car.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.100
The rest is a matter of concentration.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.930
It's a match of concentration.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.490
One small mistake will cost you the match.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.460
The road's going to widen starting here.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.250
It must be around here.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.800
Here?

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.650
Should I try?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.710
Evo and Imp drivers 
religiously believe in an idea.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.130
That cars developed for rallying must
be the best on the public streets.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.450
Last spurt yet?

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.320
No, he hasn't.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.380
Not yet.

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.650
Not here.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.650
Maybe the next?

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.160
Where is it, dammit?

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:17.150
But rallies were originally
done in snow or on dirt.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.620
4WDs aren't necessarily
unbeatable on dry asphalt.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.070
That's why I predict

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.600
this race will be decided
uneventfully in the first run.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.400
The road just got narrower,
and the visibility is poor.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.600
You won't be able to keep this pace up.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:47.400
Just before the goal, about 2 to 3 minutes in 
terms of time, his concentration will reach its peak.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.050
If our opponent can keep up with
Keisuke's top speed, Keisuke will lose.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.600
The winner will be...

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.070
You won't get away!

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.020
Evo, let's do it!

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.300
He caught me off guard, 
sprinting out in a place like that.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.800
Public roads are unfair in every way.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.500
On a complex winding road 
layout with no escape zones

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.630
strictly speaking, you can
never reach the limit.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:46.100
If there was a public road specialist,
that person would possess

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:52.490
courage, fighting spirit, experience, and 
in some cases, the recklessness of youth.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.940
I can catch up.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.620
I must.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.240
I must catch him once
again no matter what!

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:08.180
and a plus factor given only
to those chosen by God.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree-lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
