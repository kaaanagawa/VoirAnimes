Initial D

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
Raise up your hands high.
(Everybody now raise your hands)

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.000
Take hold, there's a brand new tomorrow.
(You don't stop)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.470
It's a beautiful eternal dream

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.620
where you learn about yourself.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.620
(Let's go)

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.850
Oh
(Let's go)

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.560
If you think you're lucky just to be alive
go for the highest stake in the gamble.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.780
Same mission creates similar lives.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.480
But your passion for your dream will make a difference.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
You can never use the escalator.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.290
But you can build up your strength, yeah yeah.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.200
You must eventually climb the stairs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.080
Customize them the way you like.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.100
Intense days go by.
(But you know)

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.800
Just laugh it off, because it's a game worth competing.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.330
Let's see how fast you can do it.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.150
Raise up your hands forever.
(Everybody now raise your hands up)

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
Run, sleepless challenger.
(You don't stop)

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.840
It's a quest of the never ending dream

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
where you now search for the reason to live.
(Let's go)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.050
Oh
(Let's go)

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.000
Oh, raise up your hands now.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.650
Way to go!

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.360
Keisuke managed to shake off
his opponent! It's a perfect win!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Amazing!

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.450
A huge gap of 7 seconds.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.930
Today's downhill is scary.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.090
Don't get me wrong.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.010
I'm not afraid of my
opponent, but of myself.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.540
Once I start driving, I won't be
able to suppress my fighting spirit.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.950
I've gotta shave down the margin as much as possible.
My attack will be really close to my limit.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.210
I'll be alright within my zone,
but if I screw up, I'm done for.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.710
But I'm not afraid of that,
and that's what scares me.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.510
Omiya...

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.650
Don't worry. I should be
able to manage myself well.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.020
I'll show you the best
performance of my career tonight.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.270
Our opponent chose the
lead position for the first run.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.200
I see.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.060
He might have been
inspired by Keisuke's driving.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.600
He might use the same strategy.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.400
In other words, he has absolute
confidence in his mad dash speed.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.030
In turn, we can take advantage of that.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.650
Listen. The steep area in the 
second half will be the decisive point.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.390
Try to adapt to his
change in speed flexibly.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.800
And if you feel you can make
a move, do it in this first run.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.060
There's no need to hold back.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.500
I'm Omiya Satoshi.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.590
I'm Fujiwara Takumi.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.000
Don't lose, Fujiwara.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.330
Okay, I'm going to start the countdown!

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.250
Act 3  [ Dead Line ]

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.360
How do you read this downhill race?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.200
You hit the nail on the head
for the hill climb, Kubo.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.300
I have no idea this time.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.400
It's unpredictable.
Omiya is definitely a first class driver.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.250
Three

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.240
Two

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.350
One

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.420
Go!

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.550
There are too many
unknowns about that Eight-Six.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.850
There's something strange about that car.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.870
And also something strange
about that young driver.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.650
I've been in this business for quite a while.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.990
I can tell you he's a rare
breed with a unique style.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.480
Is he fast?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.180
Oh, sure.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.450
That Eight-Six driver is
backed by a certain someone.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.510
Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.400
You look like you've been troubled by him.
Do you have some kind of issue with him?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.500
Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.300
I do. No, I mean...

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.930
There's someone else 
who does more than I do.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.420
NB8C Roadster and AE86 Trueno

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.250
both have a light and compact body
with a small displacement NA engine.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.960
They take advantage of their
agility to zip along a winding road.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.030
They share the same concept.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.250
Even though they were made years
apart, their potential is very similar.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.110
That's why...

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.640
victory will be decided by the driver's instinct.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.110
The instincts of the NB driver,
Omiya Satoshi, and...

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.690
the instincts of the Eight-Six
driver, Fujiwara Takumi.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.400
I think the result will be determined by
whose instincts match their car the best.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.330
You make it sound
like both cars are alive.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.470
Maybe so.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.560
The one who doesn't listen to the voice
of their car, even for a moment, will lose.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.900
Project D is a legendary team which swept
the northern Kanto area without any losses.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.000
It'd be wise to carefully observe how they drive from behind.
That's what Kobayakawa thought.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.940
I feel the same way.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.650
But that was the pitfall.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.250
To observe your opponent
means you can't keep your pace.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.060
It feels it's risky to
just watch the Eight-Six.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.000
I just have a hunch.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.650
That's why I chose the lead.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.000
I'll keep my pace without
any obstacles ahead.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.700
in order to win.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.650
I wonder how the downhill will develop.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.270
I don't think we can win very easily.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.760
To be honest, our opponents level is very high.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.500
My race wasn't easy, even though it 
may have looked like it from the result.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:32.030
That guy Fujiwara's facing is especially tough.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.500
He must have perfected street driving.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.840
Can you tell?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.230
I can sense it.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.500
and Fujiwara

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.820
senses it as well.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.250
The entire space seems filled,
as if he's always on guard.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.250
The leading NB will hold on, then it 
will suddenly accelerate somewhere.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.400
As a local who knows this course best, he can
maintain his pace, which gives him an advantage.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.040
So the decisive point will be?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.760
The steep, rough road 
near the end of the course.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.500
That section is disadvantageous to the
Eight-Six because its suspension design is old.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.720
Well, that's true.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.300
But our disadvantage 
didn't just begin tonight.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.060
It's been our motto to fight on our 
opponents stage since the Red Suns days.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.500
Right.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:51.040
My brother's calculated knowledge of fighting
those away races has always worked perfectly.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.000
If our opponent is a 
specialist on this course

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.930
we're a special team organized
to attack enemy territories.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.430
Whoever is faster than the other.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.400
That will be everything in the end.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.040
Nothing is impossible for Project D, as long
as we have the genius of Takahashi Ryosuke.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.800
I truly believe that.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.920
They're close, almost at the corner.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.970
They're gonna dive into the mid section hairpin.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.650
There they are!

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.600
Alright!

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:52.060
Go, Omiya!
Throw everything you've got at him!

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.670
Leave the Eight-Six in the dust!

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.000
They've passed the mid section, fighting tail to nose.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.800
It's developed the same
way up to this point.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.070
I knew my opponent would 
accelerate somewhere.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.760
I was frustrated by my opponent, who didn't
make his move according to my predictions.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.000
For some reason, I felt cornered.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:39.000
The same thing must be
happening to that Eight-Six driver.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.400
In a situation where Omiya maintains his pace,
neither of them can ease up, even for a second.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.090
We're only at the halfway point.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.350
My tension is almost going off the scale.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.680
But I have one more level.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.400
There will be a moment when
my fighting spirit turns on.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.950
Seems like my legs got thicker.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.150
Here... and here.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.010
It must be because of the muscle training.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.560
I can hit my drives farther, which is nice

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.980
but my pants size changed, which isn't so nice.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.230
I'm supposed to be on summer vacation.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.500
I wish I could go to the beach once in a while

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.280
with Takumi.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.020
That's impossible, I'm too busy.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.590
Takumi must be racing in Kanagawa now.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.520
I want to see him race just once, but

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.570
that'll probably scare the hell out of me.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:56.940
Do your best, Takumi.
Make sure you win.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.580
Good, I'm focused.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.640
From a strategic point of view, I think
braking is most important on the downhill.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:35.150
Stopping distance increases dramatically on the downhill
versus level ground, so one braking mistake is critical.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:41.040
Unlike circuits, public streets are dark without
any distance markers before each corner.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.800
So, to determine the precise braking point

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.240
you can only rely on your refined intuition.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.410
Landmarks are useless.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:10.550
I'm constantly surprised by the
potential of the human brain.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.500
Fujiwara's braking sense is exceptional.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.780
That's why he can keep winning on the downhill
against locals who are familiar with their course.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.200
It's not something you can 
acquire by just practicing.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.900
He's definitely a natural.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:38.400
You can figure out your opponent's driving skills by
watching how he brakes as you stay right on his tail.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.160
You're right.
That's not so difficult.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.300
And it's even more true between
two drivers with similar skills.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.260
Conversely, hiding skills can be the key.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.500
You show your true braking skills when

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.840
you decide to settle the match.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.150
I was late, only a little, but definitely late.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.930
That hard braking from the long straightaway.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.280
Even if it was just that one time,
I was late in braking.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.310
Incredible entry!

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.500
The gap with the Eight-Six is getting wider!

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.400
I'm using everything
 I've got at 100% capacity.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.390
I'm in a dangerous zone.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.400
They're getting closer.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.820
They're almost at the corner.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.300
Looks quite dangerous.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.630
The cars of that era tend to behave like
that when their suspension is stiffened.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.650
You can say it's very 86 like.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:41.490
The car's seriously tuned to be the very best in the stages 
where the average speed is below 100km/h (62mph).

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.800
So there's a meaning to the
choice of using the Eight-Six.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.860
That's something Ryosuke would come up with.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.700
He knows what he's doing based on the fact that
the car doesn't have any aerodynamic parts, but

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:03.100
the level of competition is so high that the cars
will momentarily reach their critical speed even
during the slow speed stage.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.440
People say the GT wing only works on the circuit,
but at their level, it's no longer a decoration.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.610
Aerodynamics might decide
the outcome of this race.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:32.220
Basically, Mazda's rear wheel drive cars are designed
to have the roll axis a little forward of the mid point.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:40.050
The FD is no exception, but the Roadster in
particular gives you a better handling feel
thanks to the biased load to the front.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.760
But if you push it harder, it tends to over steer
because of the lack of load to the rear.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.010
It becomes an unavoidable
issue when tuning a Roadster.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:03.190
There are many different approaches, but you can't
eliminate the car's natural over steering tendency.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.520
I wonder how they dealt with it.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:10.330
Over steering on the downhill is bad.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.120
Instead, you can drive faster by under steering.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.440
Knowing our opponents, their car
must have been perfectly tuned, but

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:31.790
If something destroys that balance,
Fujiwara will have a chance.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.200
I can't catch him, but

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:50.120
the gap hasn't widened, even though
I'm only tracing his car's line and speed.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.850
It's almost a miracle that you've kept up with me.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.860
From this point on,
I don't need the mirror.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.400
No need to play a guessing game.
I just have to look ahead and keep pushing hard.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.900
I'll just have to check the
rear after crossing the goal line.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.570
That's when I'll ensure my victory.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.300
The Eight-Six's headlights went off!

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.710
No way! On this pitch black
mountain pass? What's going on?

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:41.080
The Eight-Six's headlights are off?!

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.360
The blind attack, huh?

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.770
Ryosuke

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:54.000
During the race until now, Fujiwara must have
intuitively learned that he's at a disadvantage
in the high speed sections.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.990
Fujiwara's god sent talent.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:00.960
No, he may have heard
the voice of the Eight-Six.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:14.510
Blind attack, which is Fujiwara's forte, is a two sided
diversion technique of confusing his opponent

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:17.500
as well as hiding his offensive strategy.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:23.000
But when the opponent is familiar with
the course and remains highly focused.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:28.500
Right. It doesn't create the desired effect.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.580
However...

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:40.410
Retractable headlights have a lower drag
coefficient value when they're lowered.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:43.000
Because of less air resistance.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:54.140
Fujiwara must have wanted to raise his top speed by
reducing the drag, even if only by a very small amount.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.400
Fujiwara's tenacity

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:03.210
His tenacity might create

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:05.360
a breakthrough.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.350
Just before his braking action.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.000
I'm not exactly sure, but most likely.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.900
Right here.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.010
It was too soon, if only by a little.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.300
What the hell happened?

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.120
Dammit, I won't lose after coming this far.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.610
I'll keep my space.
Can you keep up?

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:31.770
I messed up the wing.
I've gotta keep the race short.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.380
I'll settle this match on the first run.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.400
The car is unstable.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.660
I don't know what's wrong with the wing,
but the car's lateral balance is off.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.700
I would've been better off if 
it had broken off completely.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:07.550
Damn, no need for excuses. I just have
to motivate myself to raise my limit.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.520
So, today wasn't my day after all.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.590
Following the brake light of the front car.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:42.200
A shimmering light up ahead in the dark street.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.430
It's the silence like a silent film.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:52.400
The light was all I could depend on.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.230
I felt like I could catch it,

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.760
if I passed through this tree lined street.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.400
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.850
I couldn't find what I'd been looking for.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.340
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.010
At this place.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.390
Please turn over the flyleaf.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.240
I lost my way.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.300
Fogged up windows, and

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.640
messed up navigation.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.300
As the stoplight turns red

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.970
a light in the side mirror blinds my eyes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.010
I gradually close the window

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.440
to stop the cold wind from blowing in.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.180
Get up! I just can't understand.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.550
We must choose one of the paths that lie ahead.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:10.970
Yeah, it starts at this moment.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.590
Because you're with me.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.800
Please turn over the flyleaf.
