Eew, it's all sticky!

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.810
What do we do with all this
oil-soaked newspaper?

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.480
We'll burn it out in a field
somewhere, so gather it all up.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.220
The only thing we can do with the remaining
oil is use a bunch of water to wash it off.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.390
Time to get some water from
the river and play bucket relay.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.190
We won't be able to get it completely clean.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.460

Huh? Where's Kenta?

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.650
In Gunma, getting more parts.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.140
Once we have those,
we might be able to fix this.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.580
Huh? Jeez, even Fujiwara
got up and came out here?

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.770
Um, is there anything I can help out with?

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.480
I appreciate it, but you need to
get plenty of rest for tonight.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.910
That's part of your job, too.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.510
But...

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.780
I'll say this to all of you.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.790
I'm aware that even if we do this,
it could all be for nothing.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.490
But D has made it this far
with a perfect record of victory,

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.700
and I can't sit back while my stupidity
causes the loss that breaks that record.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.640
Even if it costs me my life, I <i>will</i> race!

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.320
Please pick up the pace in small increments.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.950
Don't try to push it too far.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.290
Okay.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.660
The front left side is badly damaged, so be
especially careful going into right corners

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.960
that'll place excess load on it.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.500
Yeah, got it.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.660
Okay. Here goes.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.250
<i>I'm counting on you, FD!</i>

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.420
<i>For the sake of everyone who's gone</i>
<i>without sleep to make this happen...</i>

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.850
<i>And for my own pride...</i>

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.690
<i>Let's pull off a miracle!</i>

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.490
Them idiots all turned white as sheets!

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.730
Especially that spiky-haired bastard
in the FD. He was shakin' like a leaf!

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.670
Those guys talk a lotta crap, but they just
can't bring it. What a bunch of losers!

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.440
If we can scare that other driver in the
Eight-Six as well, we win both races!

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.880
Ducks in a barrel, man!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.230
<i>I don't like the way this</i>
<i>vibrates when I'm braking,</i>

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.900
<i>but it looks like I can pull off left-side cornering.</i>

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.970
<i>The problem is the right!</i>

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.140
<i>Unless I see how it acts when I push</i>
<i>it to the limit, this'll be impossible!</i>

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.380
<i>Shit!</i>

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.430
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.570
<i>I was only going at 80% speed,</i>

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.340
<i>but as soon as I shifted the</i>
<i>balance of load to the front,</i>

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.280
<i>it suddenly spun out.</i>

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.320
<i>I thought that with a little more work we</i>
<i>could turn this around somehow, but...</i>

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.110
<i>...I was naive!</i>

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:09.020
<i>What should I do? I can't</i>
<i>face the others like this.</i>

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.270
<i>Brother... I'm sorry. I just want to cry.</i>

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.850
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.780
Wait a minute. That's the
sound of a rotary engine.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.400
Hi! I came to cheer you on again.
What are you doing out here?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.570
Um...

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:04.540
<i>Is my darling mad at me?</i>
<i>Am I being too persistent?</i>

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.850
Please listen. I...

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.850
I need to ask a favor!

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.160 line:50 %
"Reduce Speed"

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.700
Since the days of the Red Suns,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.000
it's been an unwritten rule
that we only race our own cars.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.040
But I'm breaking that rule!
Let me do this, brother!

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.710
If you don't approve, I still intend to race.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.080
It doesn't even have to be
an official Project D race.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.680
Let me race! No... I have to race!

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.060
Hello? It's Ryosuke.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.900
I'm sorry for the short notice, but I
won't be needing that car after all.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.940
Yes. That's right. Sorry. I'll call you again later.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:10.710
Brother... Wait, were you trying
to get another car ready?

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:18.790
Not a very elegant solution, I thought,
but there was no other alternative.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.730
The last thing I wanted to do was
concede defeat without having even run...

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.930
Especially to those whom we face this time.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.770
Yeah!

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.770
But Ryosuke, will they accept a change of cars?

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.310
They'll gladly push rules on us to
put the advantage in their favor,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.110
but I bet they'll raise hell over anything
that gives us the least bit of an edge.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.520
I have reason to believe they'll allow it.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.090
Be forceful with them, and be defiant.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.690
It will probably work.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.030
What?! I don't care if it's the
same model, it's still a different car!

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.200
Screw that! I ain't gonna allow it!

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.770
Huh. I thought you said we could
"use the Eight-Six or somethin',"

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.810
as I recall.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.610
Shit. I didn't say nothin' like that!

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.480
F1 rules allow a "T car"
for use as a backup, yes?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.480
So let's cut to the chase.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.550
We'd be using a borrowed car
we've never driven before.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.890
The odds are overwhelmingly
in your favor, correct?

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:34.990
If you don't allow this, our only option
is to say that Project D was never here.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.470
We can take both cars and head back
to Gunma. Is that what you want?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.980
Talk about a surprise. Just like you said,
I was forceful with them and it worked.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.380
Meaning there's more to
this than meets the eye.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.420
For all their complaining about what
an inconvenience it is to race us,

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.330
they're strangely adamant about
what constitutes a victory for them.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.760
That's something we can't overlook.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.600
There must be a reason
they're so determined to win.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.200
And not for victory's sake,
but for something more tangible.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.840
Don't tell me... Money?!

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.610
It could be.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.780
Hearing that makes me that much more
determined not to lose to those guys!

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.860
How pitiful.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.300
Wantin' to win so bad you'd
wheel out someone else's car...

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.770
What a disgrace. These guys got no pride!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:49.210
Don't let them provoke you, Keisuke.
If you get in a fight with them, we lose.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.810
Yeah, I know.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:55.110
I'm just happy to be here at the starting line.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:12:00.710
Compared to that, I could care less
about their idiot attempts to provoke me.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.960
<i>I'm grateful. To everyone...</i>

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.760
<i>Even to him.</i>

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.600
Okay, here we go! Starting in five seconds!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.970
Four! Three!

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.270
Two! One!

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.960
Go!

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:33.020
<i>I'll tear ahead of 'im while he's still</i>
<i>tryin' to get used to an unfamiliar car.</i>

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.850
<i>That's why I chose to go</i>
<i>in front for the first race.</i>

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.920
<i>I ain't no fool! I'm gonna win this for sure!</i>

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.340
Say, Ryosuke, there's
something I want to ask you.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.000
I didn't expect you to cancel
the car you were preparing

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.870
and let Keisuke use the other one.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.350
It's not like you, that way of thinking.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.350
You've misunderstood slightly.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.380
If either were to be driven for the first time,

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.690
I chose the one that would be
slightly less of a burden for Keisuke.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.190
Do you understand?

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.330
Oh! Keisuke had raced against that car once!

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.060
Correct.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.630
He had seen up close how it
performed at maximum levels,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.840
and is probably aware on a sensory level
of how it is different from his own FD.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.740
To me, it was the only choice that
would prove advantageous in battle.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.910
There were no romantic
concerns at all in my decision.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.520
That girl's coming here tonight...

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.320
...was the greatest luck that
Keisuke could have asked for.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.770
<i>As I thought, this car's got power and</i>
<i>the underbody carries itself smoothly.</i>

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.000
<i>Thank you. This is a good car!</i>

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.040
Still, this was a bit of a shock.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.580
Kyoko, letting someone
borrow your FD for a race...

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.380
You'll forgive me for saying it like this,

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.550
but you've had a sort of
unnatural affection for that car.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.790
It's strange even to me.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:23.190
I always hated the idea of letting
anyone but me drive my car...

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:30.130
But I didn't hate it, I was really happy.
I've never felt this way before!

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.910
<i>If my FD can help my darling,</i>
<i>then I'll gladly let him use it.</i>

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.310
<i>Sure enough, my darling is special to me.</i>

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.750
<i>Win, my darling!</i>

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.630
Awesome! That was perfect slide control!

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:11.110
That's a borrowed FD, right? Sure enough,
Keisuke Takahashi is an FD specialist!

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.410
Still, there's a bit of space
between them. This looks rough.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.020
Apparently they couldn't practice
running this course at all last night.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.520
But they still agreed to go
up against a Lancer Evo?!

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.490
This race could be a dangerous one for them!

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.270
<i>Some journalist wrote in some magazine...</i>

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.870
<i>When it comes to general street racing,</i>
<i>the Lancer Evo is the fastest in the world!</i>

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.030
<i>Some stupid FD doesn't stand a chance!</i>

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.640
<i>I ain't got time to be playin' around, boy.</i>
<i>Just disappear already!</i>

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.660
I've been thinking... I think what will
make this race is extremely simple.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.560
Keisuke has two major handicaps.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.170
The first is that he's not in his own car.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.900
The second is, he hasn't practiced this course.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.740
Normally, this would be a
completely unwinnable race,

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.310
but with enough of a difference in the
drivers' abilities, the handicap is lessened.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.180
Keisuke's skills are far
superior to his opponent's.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.220
You know that, do you?

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.220
It's just instinct, but if I
saw it, I'd know for sure.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:35.560
He's not that good a driver.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:40.360
Under normal conditions, I think
Keisuke would've already won by now.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.000
I see.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.270
Because of the handicap, right now
there's a kind of balance between them...

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.040
That's what kind of race the hillclimb is.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.910
<i>I can't shake him. Why?!</i>

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.970
<i>This is ridiculous. This is a Lancer Evo!</i>

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.740
<i>My foot's so far on the gas that</i>
<i>I'm takin' corners so fast and scary</i>

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.650
<i>that I gotta keep my eyes</i>
<i>from poppin' outta my head,</i>

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.550
<i>so how can some guy who hasn't even</i>
<i>practiced this course be keepin' up?!</i>

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:38.150
<i>Pick up the pace, idiot!</i>
<i>You're gonna make that Lancer Evo cry!</i>

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:11.190
<i>He takes winding corners the orthodox way,</i>
<i>on a line that goes toward the center.</i>

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.420
<i>I take corners tighter, close to the in-line.</i>

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:18.330
<i>The Lancer Evo pulls ahead</i>
<i>where the line's a bit tough for me,</i>

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.370
<i>but at the next left, I'll take a wide</i>
<i>line and pick up cornering speed.</i>

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.170
<i>Then I'll tear ahead of him on</i>
<i>the course's longest straightaway!</i>

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.210
<i>I'll use the cornering tactic I used</i>
<i>in Tochigi against the R34,</i>

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.310
<i>where speeding as you come</i>
<i>out of the corner entry is key.</i>

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.010
<i>Against a high-speed, 4WD Lancer Evo,</i>
<i>it will be make-or-break time!</i>

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.490
<i>You stupid son of a bitch!</i>
<i>Don't you know? Up ahead,</i>

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:52.360
<i>there's a construction barricade</i>
<i>that makes the road narrower!</i>

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.160
<i>There ain't enough room for</i>
<i>two cars to go side by side!</i>

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.300
Don't come any closer!
I ain't got enough space!

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.410
You dumb son of a bitch!

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:11.640
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.400
Hey, asshole!

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.000
You suck! This is Project D?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.510
<i>This</i> is how you do things?
Hog the road like a damn maniac?!

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.950
If I hadn't pulled back,
that would've been a huge accident!

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.920
You really think that?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.280
What?!

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.620
You just don't take in
your surroundings, do you?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.090
What'd you say?

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.030
If you'd gone far enough over to the right,
both cars could've passed side by side.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:01.860
If you couldn't instantly see that,
you don't know what you're talking about.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.970
This wasn't some winding,
G-shaped curve. It was a straightaway!

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.110
I'd planned on going two centimeters
toward the left barricade,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:15.480
which would've opened up about five
centimeters for you along the guardrail.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.810
Quit talkin' crap!

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.050
You just don't get it. Not with
that amount of driving instinct.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:27.890
That you couldn't adapt on the fly,
changing course to come in at full speed...

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.060
It's really disappointing.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:37.560
After that, the real battle should've been how
we execute braking techniques at top speed.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.170
<i>Those</i> are the kinds of
races I've run up till now.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.230
I've got nothing else to say to your ass.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.580
True to form, eh?

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.170
Yeah.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.290
Thank you.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.480
It's a good car.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.510
There's no way we can deny
this one. We had witnesses.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.110
Dammit!

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.210
<i>I didn't expect him to lose on the hillclimb.</i>

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.120
<i>The next opponent is that kid. Whatever.</i>

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.160
That Lancer Evo's got a rear wing, huh?

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.970
How many Evos does this make now?

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.240
Six. They make for tough races.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.410
There's somethin' I wanna
say before we get started.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.810
You're pretty young. What's your name?

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.240
Fujiwara.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:04.550
Okay, Fujiwara. This is just between us,
but all you guys are sorta in trouble.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:09.160
That guy that lost the race
just now has sort of flipped out.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.660
He's called up a bunch of his friends,
really bad characters.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.200
There's a lot of them, and they
should be on their way right now.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.270
C'mon, don't look at me like that.
I don't like stuff like that, either.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:26.610
But you seem like an all right guy,
so I thought I'd give you a heads-up.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.350
It'd be best if you sorta didn't race too hard.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:38.250
In exchange, I can cover for ya...
make sure you at least don't get hurt.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.620
So, in other words...

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.060
You're telling me to lose on purpose?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.060
Nah, I didn't say that.
All I said was not to race too hard.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.260
I'm sayin' this to be kind. Think about it.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.150
Unbelievable. <i>Somebody</i> blew a
race that should've been easy as hell,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.410
so now it's up to me.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:15.480
<i>I'm gonna have to win at least one of these.</i>
<i>I've already gone and planted the seeds...</i>

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:23.230
What is it, Fujiwara? You're looking
more serious than usual. You nervous?

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.630
Matsumoto. The truth is, just now...

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.640
He said that, did he?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.940
Yes. What do you think about it?

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.680
I don't. Who's gonna buy
a cheap threat like that?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:42.350
Forget everything that doesn't matter.
Just concentrate on the race.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:47.090
The only reason we're even here is to win!

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.260
Understood. I was thinking the same thing.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.800
All right, here we go!

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.170
Starting in five seconds!

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.170
Four! Three!

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.800
Two! One!

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.360
Go!

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:26.830
<i>I gave no advice to Keisuke or Fujiwara.</i>
<i>This time, I will have them act freely.</i>

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.130
<i>The driver of the Evo VI is</i>
<i>more skilled than I thought.</i>

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:34.400
<i>While he appears nondescript at first glance,</i>

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.670
<i>on the downhill, that is likely</i>
<i>to turn out to be a ruse.</i>

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.580
<i>I've got no illusions about beatin' Project D's</i>
<i>driver fair and square on the downhill.</i>

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:53.660
<i>The key is to not let him</i>
<i>enjoy himself durin' the race.</i>

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.430
<i>Nobody, no matter who they are,</i>
<i>reacts well to violence.</i>

00:24:57.430 --> 00:25:02.900
<i>It breaks their concentration...</i>
<i>In other words, "don't race too hard."</i>

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.560
<i>It's not like I said anything wrong.</i>

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.610
<i>All I need is for his racing to be just a little off.</i>

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.200
<i>I'll take care of the rest,</i>
<i>leaving him in the dust!</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
