<i>Come with me, come and cry with me</i>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.970
<i>Got to be, got to be,</i>
<i>now you got to be free (Yeah!)</i>

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.570
<i>Noizy Tribe, you're my Noizy Tribe</i>

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.310
<i>You can feel, you can feel,</i>
<i>you can feel in my love (C'mon!)</i>

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.810
<i>Come with me, come and cry with me</i>

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.580
<i>Got to be, got to be,</i>
<i>now you got to be free (Yeah!)</i>

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.120

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.090
<i>You can break, you can break,</i>
<i>you can break 'cause you're Noizy Tribe</i>

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.120
<i>Here come the Noizy Tribe, we're back!</i>

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.990
<i>I didn't notice when I was in front...</i>

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.980
<i>...but his lines are different!</i>

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.380
<i>I don't get it. How can he be</i>
<i>so fast using a line like that?</i>

<i>This is the fiercest opponent you've</i>
<i>yet faced. He has no weaknesses.</i>

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.580
At present, there is only one
piece of advice I can give:

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.910
Endure.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.480
As much as possible, look at the
course and not the other driver.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.320
Don't forget.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.430
<i>Just how long should I endure?</i>

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.080
Hey, how many rounds does this make?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.150
Let's see... The Eight-Six started
out in front, so... Four, five...

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.450
Six.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.120
I never thought that things
would stalemate like this.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.690
Yeah. At this rate, it's hard to imagine
how the race could be settled, huh?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.480
<i>He did it again... His line!</i>

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.540
<i>It's different each time!</i>

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.220
<i>I don't understand it!</i>

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.130
<i>Is this how he races when he</i>
<i>goes to record racing times?</i>

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.220
<i>If this is how he sets record times, then I</i>
<i>don't understand what his lines mean!</i>

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.360
Sure enough, this is strange.
Something doesn't feel right.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.530
Would the great Toshiya Joshima really
be unable to outrun an opponent?

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.860
I think there's something we're not seeing.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.490
Like what?

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.340
If he's stringing the
Eight-Six along on purpose,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.840
then perhaps a shocking
turn of events is in motion

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.900
under the water's surface, so to speak.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.120
<i>Not good. It's showing up far too often...</i>

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.720
Fumihiro.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.430
Once this sixth round is finished,
I want you to have them stop refueling.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.920
Okay.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.940
It's really intense. He's just pulling
me around all over the place.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.980
Sure enough, this is an enemy
that's not easily defeated, eh?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.720
Yeah. By the way, Fumihiro.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.950
I'd like to see the calculations
that've been run so far.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.660
Is there a lot of variation in the times?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.830
That S2000 uses a really random driving style.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.670
Whoa, hang on. The one that's showing
a lot of time variation is <i>you.</i>

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.070
Take a look.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.980
These are the second, fourth and
sixth races when he was in front.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.150
The times are so exact,
it almost makes you sick, huh?

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.580
He's like a computer,
keeping a set, precise pace.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.250
I don't believe it. This can't be right!

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.200
Aren't you dragging this
out a little too long, Jo?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.170
I know you're having fun, but...

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.780
No, no. It's no fun at all.
This is taking everything I've got.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.950
That's how good a driver this fellow is.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:34.620
But Jo, middle-aged guys like us taking
on teenagers in a war of attrition...

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.450
That puts us at a disadvantage.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.620
I know. I'll end this in the next round.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.690
Okay. Well, we'll be waiting
for you down there again.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.290
Yeah.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.700
Don't be fooled by his tricks.
His goal is to confuse the line he takes.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.840
Your times when you have the lead
are erratic and becoming worse,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.680
which is proof that you've fallen into his trap.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.140
Do not be led astray by his line,
and instead believe in your own.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.700
<i>In this seventh round,</i>
<i>things will take a dramatic turn.</i>

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.830
<i>Be sure not to match his pace.</i>
<i>You must counter in your own way.</i>

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.870
You should also have noticed

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.210
that this course's ditches
and side areas may be of use.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.370
Listen, Fujiwara. This is the only way
that will give us a chance at victory.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.400
That Fujiwara...

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.440
It seems like he's taken quite a shock.
It was really unbelievable...

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.880
For the lines to be so different
while keeping a consistent time...

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.120
Is that even possible, Ryosuke?

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.890
Even on lines that at first
glance appear random,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.820
enough torque at the right points
can result in matching times.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.960
This is, after all, a course
he has run many times.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.800
But is it even possible?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.310
However, this time would clearly
not be close to one's best.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.740
You mean...

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.010
I think Fujiwara has probably noticed as well...

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.480
His opponent is not yet racing at full capacity.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:46.350
Sure enough, the appellation
"God Arm" is not just for show.

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.650
Toshiya Joshima could have the ability

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.920
to travel at the same speed
no matter what his driving line.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.430
And yet, he most assuredly has a chosen line

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.830
that he uses when out to secure his best time.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.700
He has yet to reveal that
line to Fujiwara even once.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.700
"Cunning" is the only way to describe it.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:12.780
<i>Oh! So that's why Ryosuke said to look</i>
<i>at the course and not the opponent!</i>

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.110
<i>That's what he meant by "ghost"!</i>

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:20.850
Fujiwara's ability to absorb the racing
style of his opponents when behind them

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.190
is in this case counting against him.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.790
He's been shown numerous fake
lines and gotten quite confused.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.400
However, this battle shall
shift in the seventh round.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.470
Toshiya Joshima plans to settle the
race by pulling ahead from behind.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.900
Is that true, Ryosuke?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.580
<i>This isn't funny.</i>

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:56.180
<i>He's made me race for all I'm worth, but he</i>
<i>hasn't even been running at full speed?</i>

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.750
<i>My tires are already giving out!</i>

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.080
<i>This time in particular, I feel like I can't win.</i>

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.350
<i>It's like he's got me completely</i>
<i>in the palm of his hand!</i>

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.420
<i>I probably have a neurosis</i>
<i>about guys in that age group.</i>

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.060
<i>No matter what I do,</i>
<i>he's always one step ahead of me.</i>

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.190
<i>I have no idea what I should do!</i>

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.400
Judging by the times so far,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.470
this whole thing has been
at Mr. Joshima's pace, eh?

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.970
Project D's Eight-Six is worn out by now.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:52.480
The grip on their guy's tires
is probably more worn down.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.640
The single-handed steer is easy on the tires.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.820
But more importantly...

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.920
...when Jo comes tearin' past from behind,

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.720
it's enough to throw any
opponent's rhythm off balance.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.930
For high-level racers who've
mastered their techniques to an extent,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.000
the tendency for that will be especially strong.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.270
When he's racing, Jo looks surprisingly
unconcerned about his driving line,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.440
but the truth is, even that is
calculated and under control.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.140
The way he disrupts his opponent's rhythm
is planned, like a premeditated crime.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.750
He's learned to control the car
behind him while he's up in front.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.340
That's the only conclusion you can draw.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.960
That young driver in the
Eight-Six sure has it rough.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:44.600
Bein' shown Jo's driving for three
straight races is pretty unbearable.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.690
I wonder if this seventh round
will settle it, like Jo said.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.510
In the first half of this course,
there is a section of winding roads

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.510
with more than ten left-right directional shifts.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.150
If a race that had become deadlocked
were to resume, it would be there.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:11.520
Toshiya Joshima will spring some sort of trap!

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:30.040
<i>Ko made fun of me, but I've had good</i>
<i>reason for dragging this out so long.</i>

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:36.410
<i>It's plain to see when behind the Eight-Six</i>
<i>like this, watching his movements.</i>

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.650
<i>Now I can do this the smart way, using</i>
<i>the difference in our tire per formance!</i>

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.160
<i>But there's not much room for error.</i>

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.990
<i>My own tires are already at their limit.</i>

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:53.930
<i>But victory must be smart.</i>
<i>That's how an adult wins!</i>

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.270
<i>In the area from the eighth</i>
<i>continuous winding road to the ninth,</i>

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.400
<i>there's a point where the</i>
<i>rhythm changes slightly.</i>

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.950
<i>What's more, it's just up ahead...</i>

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.440
<i>There!</i>

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.780
Awesome!

"Beware of Brush Fires"

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.830
<i>There's nothing to be disappointed about.</i>

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.930
<i>This in no way means you're unskilled.</i>

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:40.870
<i>On the contrary, considering</i>
<i>an Eight-Six's capabilities,</i>

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.140
<i>it's been a miraculously good fight.</i>

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.010
<i>There's no doubt that you</i>
<i>have exceptional talent.</i>

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:51.510
<i>I hope you'll let this experience</i>
<i>contribute to your future growth.</i>

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.980
I see. Understood.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.290
Ryosuke... Fujiwara's been passed.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.970
I guess it's over.
We put up a good fight, though.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.500
He may be our opponent,
but that was brilliantly executed.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.870
Right up until he overtook Fujiwara,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.210
he's controlled the
progression of events 100%.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.980
Everything has occurred exactly as planned...

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.880
And the ultimate expression of
this is his single-handed steer.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.750
Even knowing that, we were unable to stop it.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.990 line:50 %
"Steep Curve"

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.730
Dammit! What's that idiot Fujiwara doing?!

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.500
And after Keisuke won the hillclimb for us!

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.270
<i>He got passed, huh?</i>

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:53.580
At this rate, there's nothing we can do.
Shit! We can't win the downhill?!

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.450
I'm not so sure.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:00.020
If it was anyone else racing I'd think that,

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.420
but that's Fujiwara out there.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.060
We still don't know what could happen.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.720
Keisuke...

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.630
<i>The truth is, I don't want you to lose...</i>

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.630
<i>...because I'm going to be the</i>
<i>one who beats you! Fujiwara!</i>

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.980
Toshiya Joshima's technique is so refined

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.250
that it is a siren song for
sensory-oriented drivers like Fujiwara.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:36.750
Before they know it, they've matched pace
and are being dragged forcefully along.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:41.390
I knew from the start that he
would fall into the enemy's trap...

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.560
But it has changed the course
of what was a deadlocked race.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.100
What do you mean, Ryosuke?

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.560
Freed from the "spell" that bound him,
Fujiwara can return to his own pace.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.270
Something may yet be done...

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.970
Our chances are not zero!

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:13.790
<i>I guess I'll end this. There's no more</i>
<i>need for me to preserve my tires.</i>

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.160
<i>I'll use up the rest of their grip</i>
<i>and make a dash for it!</i>

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.880
D-Did you see that just now? That Eight-Six...

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.320
Yeah. But it can't be... That was impossible!

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.830
The tires on Fujiwara's Eight-Six are
not the only ones reaching their limit.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.330
The enemy's S2000 is slightly heavier...

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.430
True enough.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:34.700
No matter how skillfully one
manages tire performance,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.510
they have a physical limit.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.040
That time will certainly come
for our opponent's tires as well.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.280
The conditions will be the same...

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.720
When that happens, there will actually
be more options for the Eight-Six.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.290
I said earlier that the single-handed steer

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.530
is the expression of Toshiya Joshima's driving.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.900
To have achieved steering with just one hand

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:04.130
is to have complete mastery over
the outcome of driving itself.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.740
What does that mean?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.540
In a panic, anyone would grab
the wheel to steer with both hands.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.880
In other words, our opponent believes
such a thing could never occur.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.650
I get it...

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.420
The conviction that though
racing near one's limit,

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.620
one has predicted with 100%
accuracy what will occur next

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.830
and failure is an impossibility
is perhaps what predicates

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.500
the single-handed steer.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.430
Unless we somehow shatter that conviction,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.500
we will continue to be
powerless, and we will lose.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:45.780
We must make him grasp the wheel
with both hands, if only for an instant,

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.940
or we'll never make our chance.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.320
Causing the single-handled steer to fail

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.120
will also bring down Toshiya Joshima's
method of predicting driving outcome.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.550
<i>It can't be! There's no gap between us!</i>

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.900
<i>This is impossible.</i>

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.670
<i>What is he doing?</i>

00:21:54.540 --> 00:22:00.320
Be sure not to match his pace.
You must counter in your own way.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.720
You should also have noticed

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.820
that this course's ditches
and side areas may be of use.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.590
<i>This is the only way that will</i>
<i>give us a chance at victory.</i>

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.010
<i>Now I get it. So that's how!</i>

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.420
<i>He's gone...</i>

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.020
<i>It can't be!</i>

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.920
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.840
What just happened?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.250
Another pair of headlights, suddenly
shining out from the darkness...

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:47.920
<i>I lost it for a moment. I never thought</i>
<i>he'd cut in at such a sharp angle!</i>

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.830
<i>That was truly godlike driving.</i>

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.800
<i>I had a vague feeling he'd try cornering</i>

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.030
<i>using the raised road shoulder boundary...</i>

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.500
<i>but that technique brings</i>
<i>with it an incredibly high risk!</i>

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.970
<i>Just a single mistake in timing</i>

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.280
<i>would cause you to momentarily lose control.</i>

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.310
<i>For my car, which has already been</i>
<i>lowered about as far as it can go,</i>

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.950
<i>something like that would be impossible.</i>

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:16.350
<i>For older cars with an open underbody,</i>
<i>it's a game-changing ace-in-the hole.</i>

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.520
Mr. Joshima... He got passed.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.860
What the heck happened?!

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.540
What did I say? We don't know what'll happen.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.000
That's the kind of guy Fujiwara is.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.470
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:16.610
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.500
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.450
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
