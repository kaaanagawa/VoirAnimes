00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.700
Welcome!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.100
Hey, Takumi!

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.870
Is Itsuki here?

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.440
Itsuki?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.640
Uh, well, he took the day off today.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.510
He did?

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.380
The truth is... And this is
kind of hard to say, but...

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.680
He had sort of a rough time last night.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.800
That really happened?!

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.130
Yeah. For Itsuki to take a day off,
it must've been quite a shock.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.840
I never thought something like that would...

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.580
It happens a lot in love triangles.
Itsuki ended up losing out,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.150
but he got pretty close there.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.580
You have to be able to accept
the other person unconditionally.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.190
Itsuki still has a ways to go in that department.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.860
Hey, that sounds like <i>you</i>
when you were seeing Mako.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.890
You're not exactly one to talk.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.690
I told you not to mention that!

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.930
The pain of it is still too great...

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.000
Hey, you should give Itsuki
a call later and cheer him up.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.540
I don't mind doing it, but I'm not
really good at that sort of thing.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.910
The best thing is to just
leave him be for a while.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.080
Listen, when Itsuki comes
back to work tomorrow,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.110
this topic is completely off limits.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.280
Understood?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.010
--Yessir.
--Understood.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.130
High octane. Fill 'er up.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.790
Yes, sir. Thanks very much!

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.470
Hello. Thank you for the other day.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.140
Hey. This is perfect timing.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.210
There's something I want to talk to you about.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.270
There is?

"Act 15: 4WD Complex"

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.760
I can't control how things turned out,
but I did a bad thing to Itsuki yesterday.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.230
I'd like you to tell him for me.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.640
He should hurry up and forget Kazumi's
ugly ass and find himself a good woman.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.590
This is how the power
of a supercharger feels...

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.120
It's completely different from my Eight-Six.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.190
This thing easily clocks
over 200 on a chassis dynamo,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.470
but on a high-speed stage like Akina,
it's not so good on extended uphills.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.870
It sure feels good on Chichibu's
narrow mountain roads, though.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.550
So now that you've beaten
the Northwest Area coalition,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.180
you're undefeated in Saitama, huh?

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.060
Still, there is just one
bothersome group left standing...

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.800
They're a little full of themselves.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.960
In terms of skill, they probably
won't give you too hard a time.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.870
Um...

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.980
I've wanted to ask you this...

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.850
Do you feel there's some kind of limit

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.880
with the Eight-Six's power
or racing capabilities?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.750
Well, yeah. Of course there is.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.020
That's why I added the turbo,
then the supercharger,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.390
and am always fiddling with it.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.900
That last race I did in the rain,
just how old the car's basic design is

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.700
hit me really hard, like a body blow.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.370
Even you think the same thing, huh?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.580
If so, that's unexpected. I think
you're in a class all your own.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.780
Even in this day and age, you're winning
race after race, undefeated, in an Eight-Six!

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.090
No... Actually, I haven't
told anyone this yet, but...

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.780
Recently, somebody beat me.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.630
I can't believe it.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.570
Your Eight-Six, beaten on
your own home turf...

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.610
--What kind of car?
--An Impreza.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.640
A four-wheel drive, huh?

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.980
It's been driving me crazy ever since.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.080
It's like I've developed
some kind of 4WD complex.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.580
You say that,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.990
but you've beaten Lancer Evos before, right?

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.820
Don't you think it's best not to give 4WD
any kind of special consideration?

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.280
I'm trying to convince myself that, but...

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.170
In any case, the impact of it was far too strong.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.610
That's why I was wondering
what you thought about it.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.470
Well...

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.480
I'm running up against the
Eight-Six's limits too, and I don't like it.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.790
To be honest, it's not just 4WDs.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.820
It's FFs and FRs...
I'm scared of all the new cars.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.160
All of them?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.630
But I've used that complex as a
way to spring back even harder.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.460
I'm refining my techniques,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.370
and using my skills to cover
the difference in car functionality.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.970
Look, let me tell you something.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.980
This is actually the perfect chance to
get rid of this weird hang-up of yours.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.880
I think your next opponent will be a 4WD.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.950
Up till last year,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.690
you could keep on winning, having nothing
to do with theory or even being in the know,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.890
but once you've reached a certain level,
you're bound to run into its limitations.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.960
For example, you don't
really know what 4WD is,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.960
but you race your hardest
against it and end up winning.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:57.000
In a way, it's a fool's victory. But I think
that's also your greatest strength.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.210
What's being demanded of you now is that
you understand the characteristics of 4WD,

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:07.080
and that you negate your enemy's
strengths and attack his weaknesses.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.850
In other words, you win smart.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.490
I think this next race will
be a good chance for you.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.420
Why not think in your own way,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.760
and try drawing up an attack
plan for tackling a 4WD?

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.430
<i>An attack plan for a 4WD...</i>

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.430
Still, it'd be boring if you
started getting too clever.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.000
It's letting that "fool's power" of yours
run wild that makes you <i>you.</i>

Well, what did you wanna talk about?

This is just between us, but...

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.500
If we win this next race,
it'll mean some money.

They're famous, right? Project D.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.610
Being the shop that worked on those cars

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.310

than you can imagine.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.580
If you really promoted it on the Internet,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.980
I bet there'd be a huge increase in customers.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.090
Okay, I follow. So how much
are we talking about?

One race, 250,000.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.360
If it's a draw, let's say 50,000 yen.

can get results, so be it.

We've never done it that way
before, so... What should we do?

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.520
I don't understand why we have to split
the time. Can't we practice together?

The thing is, we don't
like that idea. Sorry, but...

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:42.060
We don't wanna race with guys when
we don't even know how good they are.

then just forget the whole thing.

This is their home course,
the one they always run.

The truth is, they just don't
want us to practice, right?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.670
We've never met anyone like them before,
have we? They really piss me off.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.100
Up till now, sure they've come up
with their own strategies,

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.510
but everyone we've raced
has fought a fair, clean fight.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.980
Well, if they think cutting
our practice time in half

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.780
will give them an advantage,
they couldn't be more wrong.

lesson in the true power of Project D!

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.790
Depending on how you look at it,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.020
this could be a good experience
for Fujiwara as well, right?

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.230
He'll have to come up with
a strategy for the course

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.160
and get his car ready in half the time.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.970
Which would be fine, if that's all this is.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.000
I have a very bad feeling about this.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.800
A bad feeling?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.670
There's something we haven't seen yet.
Don't let your guard down, Fumihiro.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.430
Burn both the road surface and
course topography into memory.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.590
For crying out loud. Finally!
We get to go now, huh?

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:09.180
You guys keep standing around and
it'll be morning. Let's get a move on!

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.880
Ready and standing by. Shall we go, Keisuke?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.510
Yeah.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.040
We don't have much time,
so we'll have to make this count.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.560
Understood. Here we go.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.820
They better enjoy themselves while they can.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.660
I think your best bet is to go for
the FD rather than the Eight-Six.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.630
You're not tryin' to make things
easier just for yourself, are you?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:06.730
No, I ain't. That guy in the FD
really pissed me off.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.140
He looked at me and scowled, the bastard.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.340
I wanna make that uppity little brat cry!

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:20.010
Fine, okay. We split the money
we get right down the middle.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.790
Hello? It's me. You ready?

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:28.820
The target is...

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.790
...the FD.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:37.300
Are we really gonna do this? If we
get busted, there's gonna be trouble.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.000
Just do it.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.600
Understood. I don't know how
good our aim will be, though.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.010
If we're off, we could get both cars.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.480
If it happens, it happens.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.970
He says the target is the FD.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.180
<i>Having our practice time</i>
<i>cut in half really stings.</i>

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.050
<i>I don't have the luxury of thinking</i>
<i>about how to battle a 4WD...</i>

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.350
<i>Right now, I just have to</i>
<i>concentrate on the course!</i>

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.190
<i>These cracks in the road make the car bounce.</i>

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.020
<i>I have to remember all the cracked areas!</i>

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.150
<i>The road sur face is a bit rough, but there's</i>
<i>really nothing to this course at all.</i>

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.220
<i>Practice is a lot of fun.</i>

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.210
<i>Every time I pass him like that, I think</i>
<i>to myself, "I ain't losin' to him!"</i>

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:23.570
<i>The FD feels good today. At this rate,</i>
<i>it should be ready to race in no time.</i>

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.400
<i>I'll friggin' show you how it's done!</i>

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.250
<i>There's something flowing... Water?</i>

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.760
<i>There was nothing there earlier.</i>

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.550
<i>It's not water! Oh, no!</i>

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:12.850
Hello, Fumihiro? It's Keisuke.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.420
Yeah. What's up?

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.320
Are those guys still there?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.760
By "those guys," you mean
the ones we're racing?

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.000
They left a little while ago. Is everything okay?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.970
Hell no, it's not okay!

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.770
This is an emergency. Stop the Eight-Six.
Do <i>not</i> let him come back this way!

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.270
What's going on?

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.840
Somebody tossed a bunch of oil
all over the goddamn road!

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.310
What?!

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.510
So, are you all right?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.620
I... I'm fine, but...

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.850
...the FD is screwed up.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.830
This is terrible. There's no way anyone
could've avoided this. Not even Keisuke.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.640
Who would do this?

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.570
It's obvious! Who the hell else was here?!

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:09.980
Whoever spilled this oil
probably fled via that side road.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.750
According to the map, the road
is just wide enough to fit one car

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.420
and runs to the next city.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.920
Then if we hurry and get over
there to the other end first,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.160
we can seize the idiot by the neck
as he comes sauntering out!

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.530
I'm taking Van #1, brother.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.160
I'll go with you, Keisuke!

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.830
Stop, Keisuke. It's a waste of time.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.700
But brother! I can't just let this go!

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.840
How can I stand by when they've
wrecked my precious FD?!

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:39.340
We've gotta grab 'em and
knock the hell out of 'em!

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:43.780
I'm telling you to control yourself.
Don't go running off half-cocked!

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.380
--How is it?
--It's going to be a bit of work.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.560
The suspension arm is damaged,
and after an impact like that,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.960
we're going to have to
check the alignment, too.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.090
There is 100% no way it can
be ready by tomorrow night.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.560
There's nothing wrong
with the drive system, right?!

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.570
Do something to make it run!

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.940
Make some emergency repairs!
It doesn't even have to run in a straight line!

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.210
I'll make it work somehow!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.210
Don't talk foolishness, Keisuke. If a
car's got trouble with its underbody,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.410
pushing it to the limit amounts to suicide.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.920
He's right. There's no telling
how the car will behave.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.750
Its limits have been pushed way down...
Racing it in this state would be impossible.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.230
Oh dear, oh dear. I thought
things were a bit too quiet.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.300
You got into a wreck <i>here</i>?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.810
That was a pretty damn rotten trick you pulled.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.520
You all did this, didn't you?! That oil!

00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:02.360
I don't follow. What're ya talkin' about?
Enough with the weird accusations already.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.530
Well? You got any proof it was us that did it?

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.500
Don't screw with me!
I don't need proof, I frickin' <i>know</i>!

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.500
Now quit flappin' your mouth
and get outta that damn car!

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.800
Stop it, Keisuke.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800
Oooh, what a surprise!

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.310
This "Project D" team of yours
has a real attitude problem, huh?

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.710
Yeah, I get it. Not only do ya make
accusations without any proof,

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.820
you go around threatenin' the
people you're supposed to race!

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.650
Eeew, that's so uncool. I wouldn't
wanna race people like that!

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.130
I'm sorry. Please forgive us.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.030
As you can see, our hillclimb
car has gotten into a wreck.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.000
It's been badly damaged,
and it won't be fixed soon.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.470
Yeah, well, that's a shame.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:56.680
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but could
we possibly postpone our race for a week?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.650
A week, huh?

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.320
Yes. We would definitely be ready
within that amount of time.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.320
I get it. I know just what you're sayin'.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.220
But the answer is, "No."

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:16.000
We ain't made of free time, you know.
I got me a date next weekend.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.230
<i>Bastard!</i>

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:24.440
In motorsport, a car that don't make it to
the startin' line is automatically the loser.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.780
Whatever you all's circumstances,
it's got nothin' to do with us.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.280
Right? Or am I wrong?

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.720
We start at 8:00 tonight, as agreed.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.350
Use the Eight-Six or
somethin' instead, whatever.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:44.450
Don't forget, if yer even
one minute late, you all lose.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.060
Shit!

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.270
That guy's gettin' on my last goddamn nerve!

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.540
We have no time for you to take your
frustrations out on the guardrail.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.070
Fujiwara and Matsumoto, you work
on setting up the Eight-Six.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.870
--Okay.
--Understood.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:06.910
However, run the course in halves until
we've finished cleaning up the oil.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:11.650
All other personnel are on oil detail.
We don't have time. Hurry!

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:13.550
Hold on!

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.420
What am I supposed to do?

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.890
Brother, aren't we going to try fixing the FD?

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.760
If we did, it would be a wasted effort.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.830
I have explored all options, and my
conclusion is that it is not possible.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:29.070
There isn't enough time.
Your role in this race is no more.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.070
You shall stay on the sidelines.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.070
Brother, please let me race!

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.610
At this rate, we're just
playing right into their hands!

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:39.580
Do you still not understand, Keisuke?
The blame for the FD's crash lies with you.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:41.580
Huh?

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.790
Yes. If it were me, I would not have crashed
my car over a simple trick like that.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:53.160
This was caused by ego and lack of attention.
Calm yourself and think this over!

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.430
Let's get to work.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:11.040
I... I can't accept this.
Ryosuke is being too harsh.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.480
There's no way so much oil
could have been avoided.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.650
No matter how you look at it,
it's just not possible!

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.790
No.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:28.230
My brother could do it. He could've
cleared that oil spill like it was nothing.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:33.870
It's just like he said, Kenta.
And the truth is, I know it.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:40.140
I'm angry at myself for falling
right into a cheap trick like that.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.710
That's exactly why,
no matter what, I <i>have</i> to race!

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.550
What should I do? Tell me, Kenta!

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:52.210
Keisuke!

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.330
<i>Keisuke wants to race, but can't.</i>
<i>If I think about how he feels too much,</i>

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.160
<i>I start feeling mixed up myself. But...!</i>

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.710
<i>Right now, all I can do is give my total</i>
<i>concentration to the job I've been given.</i>

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.670
<i>And I will definitely win. I'll beat them!</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.460
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:16.600
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.490
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.440
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
