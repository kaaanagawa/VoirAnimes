<i>You can feel, you can feel,</i>

<i>Got to be, got to be,</i>

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.120
<i>Here come the Noizy Tribe, we're back!</i>

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.470
Starting in five seconds.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.440
Four... Three...

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.940
Two... One...

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.430
Go!

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.530
<i>He's fast! He's so incredibly fast!</i>

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.190
What do you think they're up to?
The Cappuccino is a minicar.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.900
You think they're just screwing
with us, bringing out a car like that?

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.770
Dude, you're clueless, aren't you?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.240
Last year, when the Eight-Six
of Akina made its debut,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.680
all the racers in the Gunma area thought
the same thing when they saw Fujiwara...

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.880
Because an Eight-Six is
an old car and lacks power.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.780
But in the end, all of them lost.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.750
Even the Night Kids and we Red Suns.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.460
They've made use of that same advantage.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.360 line:50 %
"Act 11: Rainy Downhill Battle"

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.820
Just what hat did you pull that rabbit out of?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.990
When you put it like that, it sounds as
if you realize just how dangerous it is.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.500
I guess.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.000
Not that I should be telling
this to you, the enemy, but...

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.970
Even if we beat the Eight-Six using that car,

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.410
it'll only make me halfway happy.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.920
To be honest, being able to defeat the
Eight-Six like this, in a place like this...

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.420
It's a little painful.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.190
Don't automatically assume he'll lose.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.360
We won't know how it'll turn out until it's over.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.330
No, I know. Sadly, this time
there's no way he can win.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.630
I told you not to assume that, didn't I?

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.200
If you look at just car vs. car, the chances
of the Eight-Six winning do look slim. But...

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.310
...what's driving that car is a
flesh-and-blood human being.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.940
And in a contest between driver and driver,
there's no telling what will happen.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.650
Are you trying to say our driver's no good?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.150
Sakamoto's skills are solid.
He won't make any slipups.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.980
That's not what I mean.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.980
You don't understand...

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.330
...just how incredible he is.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.130
It's not logic. If you were on the
same team as us, you'd understand.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.330
There's genius in this world that can
break the boundaries of convention.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.710
It stings, but I know that it's true.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.580
Anyway, you just watch.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.990
Rain is a drag, huh? It makes
you slip, gets you all wet...

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.930
You're one to talk. Takumi's the one who
has it tough, having to race in this rain.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.570
That's right. Doing a downhill
in the rain is kinda scary.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.770
Both of you, Iketani and Kenji?!

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.510
Takumi can handle the rain just fine!

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.110
Have you forgotten?
That race in the rain at Myogi?!

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.880
Yeah, that's true...

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.850
What's more, I've experienced
Takumi's godlike skills firsthand!

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.050
Takumi losing a race in
the rain just isn't possible!

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.650
Which will you choose, leading or following?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.550
When it's raining, going first and having
to set the pace causes added pressure...

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.820
Even so, I'd prefer to lead.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.730
We Ferrari racers don't specialize in following,
and I don't want to draw the race out.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.260
If possible, I'd like to end this in the first lap.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.600
Understood. I'm of the same
opinion. We'll choose to lead.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.910
Fujiwara...

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.090
I think you'll understand once the race begins,
but that car will be shockingly fast.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.660
You will probably fall behind at corners
and have to catch up on the straightaways.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.530
This will be completely unlike
any race you have yet fought.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.470
Here is my advice...

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.880
Try to remember the
hardest race you have run.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.980
Recall the technique used on you
that you found most disagreeable,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.010
for today, <i>you</i> will perform that technique.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.320
To give you a hint...

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.990
For example, the methods of
Kyoichi Sudou of Team Emperor.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.030
Something like that would be effective.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:43.460
Don't forget, having a
completely different mindset

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.020
will be the key to winning this battle.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.690
Ryosuke, the way you give Fujiwara advice

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.160
is slightly different from before, isn't it?

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.530
--It is?
--It's changed.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.270
How can I put this? It used
to be simpler, more concrete.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.670
And concise, a "Do this like <i>this</i>" sort of thing.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.510
But today's was a little difficult, or rather...

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.850
It made Fujiwara think for himself
and make his own choice.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.180
That's the kind of advice it's become.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:46.530
It's an indicator of how much
Fujiwara has improved. Matsumoto...

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.870
I seek to provide Keisuke and Fujiwara
with tasks during their D battles.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.200
I had sort of a vague feeling.
I wondered if that was the case.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.540
It's thanks to those tasks that Fujiwara
has been able to advance as much as he as

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.440
in such a short period of time.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.550
But this time, I may have gone a little too far.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.720
Considering his opponent, not
everything will go according to plan.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.950
The hurdle I've placed before
Fujiwara may have been too high.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.070
<i>I don't get it. This has never</i>
<i>happened before, not once.</i>

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.440
<i>It's hard to do this. Really hard!</i>

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.520
<i>What should I do?!</i>

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.850
<i>Not being able to take a corner at the</i>
<i>same speed as the car in front of me...</i>

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.910
<i>That's the first time this has ever happened!</i>

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.140
I still don't really understand...

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.880
How much does the Eight-Six weigh?

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.480
Nine-fifty... nine-sixty or so, I think.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.990
That's right. It's less than a ton.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.790
But the Cappuccino weighs even less
than that, probably 700-plus kilograms.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.160
That's a difference of 250 kilograms.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.800
You know that the difficulty in controlling
a car is relative to its weight, yes?

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.040
You're shackled by the car's inertial mass.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.010
So that 250-kilogram difference
gives the Cappuccino the advantage?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.250
No amount of tuning can beat light weight.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.550
Then this race is...

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.020
I'm telling you, don't assume
the outcome before it's happened!

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.480
Our guy can't be measured
by normal standards.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.040
<i>In the friction ratio for the contact</i>
<i>sur face between the road and tires,</i>

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:20.080
<i>a lower MU value will greatly affect whether</i>
<i>one under- or overshoots when cornering.</i>

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.420
<i>It'd be fine if the car were to</i>
<i>consistently remain neutral,</i>

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.920
<i>but that sort of car doesn't exist.</i>

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.090
<i>In that case!</i>

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.120
<i>Rather than understeer,</i>
<i>which can't be controlled,</i>

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.560
<i>one should seek from the start</i>
<i>to create controllable oversteer.</i>

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.890
<i>That's how I do things!</i>

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.800
<i>In the tough-road world of Ferrari racing,</i>
<i>four-wheel drift is fundamental!</i>

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.910
<i>Still, he's done a good job keeping up.</i>

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.280
<i>Even when it looks like I</i>
<i>can shake him off, I can't.</i>

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.480
<i>Rain takes getting used to.</i>
<i>To be honest, it's scary even for me.</i>

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:05.730
<i>Nobody knows exactly how best</i>
<i>to merge to safely avoid crashing.</i>

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:11.830
<i>That guy knows it's more dangerous</i>
<i>for him, yet he keeps coming after me.</i>

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.270
<i>You can keep walking that</i>
<i>razor's edge till the very end!</i>

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.300
For this race...

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.040
...it was only the day before yesterday
that I received specific information

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:28.010
regarding what tactics
our opponents would use.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.580
To be honest, I thought
perhaps we'd be in trouble.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.880
This mistake is on me.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.580
Mistake? Even you make mistakes?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:45.220
Frequently. I bluff my way through it,
but inside I'm on pins and needles.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.260
However...

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.660
This time, luck is on my side.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:57.100
An uncertainty that no one could have
calculated may cancel out my mistake.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.260
An uncertainty?

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.920
<i>I don't understand it...</i>
<i>The meaning of Ryosuke's advice.</i>

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.250
<i>The "methods"of Kyoichi of Team</i>
<i>Emperor? What were they again?</i>

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.600
<i>Ryosuke said to catch up on the</i>
<i>straightaways, but that's impossible.</i>

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.640
<i>What do I do?!</i>

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.870
<i>There's no way to beat an opponent</i>
<i>you can't even catch up to!</i>

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.090
The uncertainty was this rain.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:58.800
So you think the rain will give
Fujiwara the advantage?

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.670
But that goes against popular theory.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.770
Rain reduces the MU of the road's surface,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.970
and if the tires' grip weakens uncontrollably,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.410
a major handicap will become even greater.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.970
I think that would be the standard conclusion.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.920
You're overlooking something.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.760
That theory holds true for a midday
race at someplace like a circuit...

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.590
...but nighttime on a rainy
mountain pass is a different story.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.630
In conditions such as those, the emphasis
shifts from the car to the driver.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:37.340
Also, the X factor, or ability beyond that of
mere driving techniques, is called into play.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.170
X factor?

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.540
Therein lies our chance.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.050
This rain will change the hurdle I
thought too high to just the right height

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.980
and is the uncertainty of which I spoke.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:56.620
Perhaps this rain is a blessing, made to fall
by the powerful luck that Fujiwara possesses.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.520
<i>I can close the gap a bit on the</i>
<i>latter half of the straightaways.</i>

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.740
<i>Does that mean that at least on extended</i>
<i>straightaways, I have the advantage?</i>

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.880
<i>This really is a first. Winning in</i>
<i>power but losing at cornering...</i>

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.980
<i>It's sort of pitiful. This is stressing me out.</i>

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.680
<i>To think, having no choice but to battle it</i>
<i>out on a mountain downhill straightaway!</i>

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.430
<i>The way he moves so effortlessly...</i>
<i>I'm getting more and more pissed off!</i>

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.520
<i>Whatever it takes, I wanna catch</i>
<i>up and put the pressure on him!</i>

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.560
<i>Oh! Kyoichi's "methods"...</i>
<i>Maybe he meant that!</i>

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.120
Unreal! Cappuccinos are that fast?!

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.560
The Eight-Six is undefeated, but...

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.520
Project D's ace downhill racer can't catch up?!

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:23.410
<i>He meant Kyoichi's specialty</i>
<i>technique, no doubt about it.</i>

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.550
<i>I'm going to have to close the gap to pull it off.</i>

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.210
<i>Just watch, I'll friggin' catch up to you!</i>

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.440
Okay, understood. Thank you.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:01.470
They've just passed the road cut hairpin.
There's a 10-15 meter gap between them.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.760
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.520
<i>The Eight-Six being able to keep up with</i>
<i>the Cappuccino this far is most unusual.</i>

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.970
<i>In my simulations,</i>
<i>this event was an impossibility.</i>

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.010
<i>Was the rain not to our advantage after all?</i>

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.320
<i>If the race cannot be settled at the</i>
<i>decisive, steeply inclined section,</i>

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.450
<i>the gently inclined, mid- to high-speed</i>
<i>section in the latter half shall be worrisome.</i>

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.560
I miscalculated.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.700
The capabilities of the Eight-Six's
driver cannot be calculated.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.460
They've upset what was thought
to be a 100% probability of victory.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.580
<i>I get it. The Eight-Six's</i>
<i>whole body is telling me.</i>

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:17.990
<i>The slight sensation of the tires slipping as</i>
<i>they grip wet asphalt... It's almost palpable!</i>

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.550
<i>I feel like with this car, I can even know</i>
<i>how much rain is flowing on the asphalt.</i>

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.230
<i>I can definitely catch up to him!</i>

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.370
<i>I'll have one chance, two at the most,</i>
<i>to set up a counterattack.</i>

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.620
There's one thing that's got me anxious.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:50.290
The first thing that comes to mind about
Sudou from Team Emperor is a counterattack.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.020
Indeed.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:57.230
I'm worried what sort of judgment Fujiwara
will make with his mind so confused...

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.270
...because a counterattack would be a mistake.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.900
Exactly. True to form, you understand.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.430
A counterattack is 100% doomed to failure.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.300
<i>He's gaining on me!</i>

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:42.810
<i>Wataru's Eight-Six couldn't</i>
<i>keep up with this car.</i>

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:47.080
<i>I don't get it! How can he</i>
<i>be this fast in the rain?!</i>

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.920
<i>Even I am struggling, searching for grip</i>
<i>on front tires that can't be relied upon.</i>

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.990
<i>I can't do any more than this!</i>

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.920
<i>It's scaring even me!</i>

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.980
<i>This isn't logic... It's instinct.</i>

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.780
Rain sure is terrible...

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:27.290
Even an F1 racer with godlike
technique would spin out in the rain

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.990
and fly right out of the course.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.720
That's how difficult rain is.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.130
How it falls can change each
and every racing condition,

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.200
and there's no telling when it'll stop.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.530
One mistake on this
narrow road, and it's <i>boom.</i>

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.370
Even so, you have to pull yourself together
and go on the offensive, or you'll lose.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:52.010
It's a continuous battle between fear and
motivation. Especially on the downhill.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.170
It takes ten times more out
of you than a normal race.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.990
<i>Dammit! What the hell are you?!</i>

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.360
<i>I feel sick. He keeps gaining on me...</i>

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.190
<i>What does this mean?!</i>

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:21.170
<i>I think this was how it played out...</i>
<i>The race against Kyoichi at Iroha Slope.</i>

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.690
<i>When your opponent has</i>
<i>better cornering speed,</i>

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.530
<i>you have to abandon the corner attack.</i>

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:49.370
<i>Slow down, quickly change the car's direction,</i>
<i>then speed up the acceleration timing!</i>

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.860
<i>I have to spend just a little</i>
<i>more time stepping on the gas.</i>

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:13.130
There's something I just can't accept.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.730
This "Shame and reputation be damned,
I came to win!" attitude really ticks me off.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.770
Because on the downhill,
being light is an incredible weapon.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.600
But I couldn't stand losing to these guys!

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.010
If we friggin' lose, I'm kicking Fujiwara's ass.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.910
That's just like you, Keisuke...

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:33.150
Anyway, there's no mistaking
we're in a tight situation.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.820
My only hope is that there's some
reason Ryosuke wished for this rain.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.990
If we can at least make it to
the midpoint, there may be hope.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.860
If Fujiwara makes it to the bottom,

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.960
the roads aren't too steep
and there are long, straight lines.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.130
--Ironic, isn't it?
--You said it.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.800
The downward slope has been
the only thing in his favor

00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.170
as Fujiwara has gone up against
some powerful enemies, but this time...

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:06.010
...far from being his friend, that slope
will put him through the wringer.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:28.070
<i>Does this guy not feel fear?!</i>

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:32.540
<i>Up this close, the shower of water</i>
<i>droplets obstructs your headlights.</i>

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.240
<i>I hate that, which was the main</i>
<i>reason I chose to race in front!</i>

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.580
<i>Driving in the night rain is bad enough,</i>
<i>but with the spray of water I'm sending up</i>

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.340
<i>his field of vision should be</i>
<i>hopelessly obstructed, and yet...!</i>

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.160
<i>He's right up on me!</i>

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.500
<i>Why?! He should be completely</i>
<i>unable to see from that side ditch,</i>

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.430
<i>so how can he keep up with me so precisely?!</i>

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.040
<i>You son of a bitch, you're not human!</i>

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.370
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:37.470
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.460
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:08.460
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:16.610
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.200
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.500
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.510
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:57.450
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
