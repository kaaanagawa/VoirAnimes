00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.110
<i>Here come the Noizy Tribe, we're back!</i>

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.490
So you're off this week? No D expeditions?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.530
That's right. It'll take a little
while to fix Keisuke's car,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.600
so that plus time off comes
to an interval of one week.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.230
That last Saitama trip seems
like it sure was a handful...

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.500
It really was.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.270
They were a terrible bunch,
coating the course with oil and so on.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.510
If you guys go out across the whole country,
you're bound to run into all sorts of types.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.500
But I never thought someone would
attack us during our practice run.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.790
It made me think we can
never let our guard down...

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.020
But you keep on winning!

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.260
I've started to feel kinda like,
"Of course Takumi's gonna win!"

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.960
Recently, he's lost a lot of
that newbie shine, huh?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.940
Yeah, but the fact he's kept winning since
his first race has to weigh pretty heavy.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.770
It's a lot of pressure.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.580
With this latest race, I really thought
that Keisuke is an amazing person.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.310
He refuses to give up, or...

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.480
No matter how impossible the situation seems,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.990
for him, the only thing to do is race.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.920
His tenacity ended up saving a
race everyone thought we'd lost.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.830
He pulls everyone around him
into action, making them energized.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.070
When I see that, I know I have
to work hard to keep up.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.630
It's so much pressure...

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.280
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, you've made
it this far without having lost once.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.410
That must be a heavy burden on you drivers.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.850
We can't even imagine it, huh?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.750
Yeah... "We"?!

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040
Hey. Been waiting long?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.650
No. What's with this FC?

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.520
It's my brother's car. He almost
never lets me borrow it, but...

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.620
I forced him to let me. Anyway, get in!

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.210
Okay!

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.070 line:50 %
"Act 18: Last Drive"

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.650
What do you wanna eat?

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.550
This is to thank you for before,
so whatever you want is on me.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.590
You wanna take the Kan-Etsu
Expressway into Tokyo?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.230
We could do that, but I don't
like places that are too busy.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.730
If possible, I'd prefer Gunma to Tokyo.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.000
You're okay with that?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.570
Sure! After all, you have this car,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.040
so rather than the big city with all the traffic,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.940
it'd be better to go somewhere
we can have a relaxing drive.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.570
Okay.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.590
Wow, what an incredible view!
The cars look like ants!

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.180
I wonder which way the Kan-Etsu is...

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.240
Project D is done going to Saitama, right?
Where will you be heading to next?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.730
--Ibaraki.
--Wow, you're going far!

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.620
I... It's okay, right?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.220
I can keep going to support
you at your races, right?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.260
You can ignore me if you want.
I won't get in the way.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.600
I just want to watch! And...

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.270
And I could be helpful like
last time, even if it was a fluke...

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.750
I swear, you...

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.480
How can I put this? I don't know
if it's youth or innocence, but...

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.280
Once you've decided something,
there's no changing it, is there?

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.960
You're the type that can take
corners without hesitation,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.600
not even knowing what lies ahead.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.760
So the answer's "no"?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.840
Enough about this. Let's talk after we eat.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.600
I don't know about you, but I'm hungry.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.950
Hello, Ryosuke? It's me.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.020
We have an idea of how to address
all the FD's planned repairs.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.190
I thought I'd let you know.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.520
I see. Sorry for asking so much, Fumihiro.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.790
No, no. Nothing of the sort.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.630
This will result in a dramatic boost
of the FD's racing capabilities.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.670
This is going to be a complete overhaul.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.510
Yes. Going forward, we will
face a string of difficult races.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.740
We have to make the burden on
the driver even a little lighter.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.880
Okay. Tomorrow, Kenta and I will go
scout out the next course as planned.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.590
Understood. Be careful, and come back safely.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.180
Okay.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.670
<i>It doesn't seem real.</i>

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:33.210
<i>If someone we didn't know saw us, I bet</i>
<i>we'd look like a couple out on a date.</i>

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.250
<i>I've never known such happiness.</i>

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.920
<i>It's like being a rotary engine that</i>
<i>can keep running in the red zone!</i>

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.790
<i>So this is the feeling of the person</i>
<i>you like being right next to you.</i>

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.060
<i>I don't want to ruin this. It's my first true love!</i>

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.740
<i>Incredible... Being on the roads of Akagi</i>
<i>in my darling's passenger seat!</i>

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.540
<i>Even though he's running at a</i>
<i>slow pace, I can tell the difference.</i>

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.110
<i>It's ultra smooth...</i>

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.880
<i>Everything about him is on a different level!</i>

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:23.490
<i>This is incredible, too! When he shifts up,</i>
<i>you don't feel the change in G forces.</i>

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.600
<i>I've never seen anyone per form</i>
<i>such delicate clutchwork</i>

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.670
<i>while driving on a winding road!</i>

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.760
<i>This is what it's like to achieve</i>
<i>near mastery of driving techniques?</i>

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.850
Your driving sure is incredible.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.120
You think? It's not like I was really going at it.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.960
Maybe that's what made it easier to tell.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.690
You were completely at ease,

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.690
almost considerate toward
the clutch and gearbox.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.160
It's not as if I'm always like that.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.000
When I get serious and go on the offensive,
I can get sloppy, kick the clutch around...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.040
Being out on the road and pushing our cars
to their limits puts a lot of stress on them.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.650
That's why when driving normally, I've gotten
in the habit of treating them with more care.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.550
Huh?

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.620
Oh, it's Keisuke!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.190
This is unusual. He's brought a girl!

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.960
Who's that? Your girlfriend?

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:30.620
Shut yer hole! Where do you get off?
Get the hell out of here! Get goin'!

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.960
Jeez!

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:47.180
Up until I got my 4WD license,
I hung out with a pretty bad crowd.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.350
I got into a lot of fights, rebelled against
my parents... I caused a lot of problems.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:59.820
Looking back, I was just being an idiot.
But at the time, I didn't have any goals,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.560
and every day I was bored and angry.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.260
<i>I understand. I know that feeling.</i>

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:14.870
My parents gave up on me, but my brother
was the only one who knew how I felt.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.870
Even now I can't forget...

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:21.570
That time, he took me in
this FC to Mount Akagi.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.880
Suddenly, he opened her up
full-throttle on the downhill.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.760
It was such a shock. I really
thought we were done for!

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.560
I totally thought he was taking his no-good
younger brother with him, killing us both.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.770
It's been three years since then.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.740
I still don't think I've beaten the downhill
my brother showed me that day.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:54.110
Huh?! You're joking, right?
Is your brother that good?

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.610
I guess so.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.480
Anyway, since then,
my life's completely changed.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.990
I can't even imagine a life without cars in it.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.290
Wow...

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.930
So here's the thing. To go back to what
we were talking about before dinner,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.430
this time I'll say it clearly.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:18.800
I'm sorry... but I can't date anyone right now.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.290
Please don't come see me anymore.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:42.690
I... From the start, I didn't
expect that you'd date me.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.930
I'm fine knowing you don't feel the way I do.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.630
I've come out to watch you
on my own, because I want to.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:55.870
You're so cruel, Keisuke. Why do
you suddenly have to be so cold?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:01.180
You've been kind to me all day.
You let me ride in your passenger seat...

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.550
You even told me so many
personal things about yourself!

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.990
I thought we'd gotten closer than before.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:12.460
I was so happy, but now...!

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.790
It's not as if I hate you.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:21.730
But until Project D finishes,
I won't date anyone.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.720
That's what I've decided.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:31.410
Unless I focus all my energy,
and push myself to the very limit,

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.380
I feel I won't be worthy
to be one of D's drivers.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:39.350
I understand that! I know
how important Project D is!

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.520
That's why I do my best,
trying not to interfere in any way.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.090
That's still not good enough?
Even just watching you from afar?

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.230
You know, when you say something
like that, I just don't understand.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.000
You're fine just watching? I don't get it.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.400
If I like someone, I want
every last part of them.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.910
Some wishy-washy, half-assed feeling
is painful and unacceptable.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:13.780
You're the same, aren't you?
The truth is, you understand this, right?

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.290
You're like me, the type who can't
stand something that's not 100%.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.020
Our upcoming expeditions during the summer
are going to get more and more intense.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.090
I won't have time to spend with you.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:30.800
I'm saying this because I know things would
only get harder and more painful for you.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.740
I do think you're cute, but I
don't intend to date anyone.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.970
Please understand.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.490
I have a favor to ask. Now that it's over...

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:02.130
Now that it's over, I want to be in your
passenger seat and see you go full-throttle.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.800
Please!

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.000
All right.

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.480
So? How's Takumi been since then?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.820
Does it look like he'll find something
to pull him out of his slump?

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.220
Yeah, I dunno.

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.760
He's certainly headed in
sorta the right direction, but...

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.770
The way his eyes look
when he gets outta the car

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.070
after finishin' his delivery has changed.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.570
Oh?

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:56.070
The thing about him, Yuichi...

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.810
Every mornin', he does a real
tough race on the Akina downhill.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.610
Huh? Against who?

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.980
His other self.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.780
His other self?

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:10.920
Yeah...

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.990
When he drives the Eight-Six, he races
all-out to catch up to an imaginary Impreza.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:23.530
And when he drives the Impreza, he tries
his hardest to outrun a pursuin' Eight-Six.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.330
Huh.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:31.510
Knowin' the course as well as he does,
he's fully aware of how each car differs.

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:36.650
For example, the difference in KPH
from one corner to the next in either car.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.120
With his degree of sensitivity...
Yeah, I could see that.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.320
Do that enough times, and you
can sorta learn in long areas

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.290
how many seconds or how many meters
difference there'll be between 'em.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.730
He should have a pretty precise
understandin' of those things.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:59.300
In the Eight-Six, he probably has a clear
image of the Impreza in his windshield

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.400
as it takes off ahead.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.310
It's so hot! Summer's here again, huh?

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.710
Yup. Actually, it was just about
this time last year, wasn't it?

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.520
The battle with the Red Suns...

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.180
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.250
That's where everything started.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.520
The legend of Akina's Eight-Six downhiller.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.260
That year's gone by in a flash, huh?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.400
In just one year,
Takumi's climbed so friggin' high!

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.560
Yup, talk about a world of
difference between the two of you.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.510
Anyway, this time of year
is just too much, huh?

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.910
It makes you wanna go out and
blow off your youthful energy!

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.780
I want a love so hot it burns!!

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:48.250
That's pretty incredible, huh?

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:55.590
Even at the pro level, you won't find
many drivers who go racing every day!

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:02.970
So if he practices that hard, hasn't he
closed the gap a bit between the two cars?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.470
Is that what you think?

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.770
Yeah.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.410
The thing is, just think about it.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:15.410
Say one day Takumi's in the Eight-Six
and he makes some new discovery,

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:21.280
a different line than he's used up till now
that makes 'im a couple milliseconds faster.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.960
But the next day, he's able to run
that same line in the Impreza.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.330
Th-That's rough...

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.800
So he keeps trying to catch an opponent
that can't be caught, no matter what?

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.170
Before, the Eight-Six was
the absolute standard for him...

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.470
But havin' that one standard become <i>two</i>
will have a world of meanin' to him.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.310
How can I put it?

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.680
To exaggerate a bit, his entire view
on drivin' techniques will change...

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.850
As if the line connectin'
two points will be dotted

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.490
with an endless number of other points.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.850
Huh...

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.090
His reasonin' skills will improve.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.430
More and more, he'll understand
things that up till now he hasn't.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.640
You get enough knowledge and experience,
that leads to confidence and technique.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.200
That's the route Takumi's taken to get here.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.540
And of course, what he'll do goin' forward.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.700
Awesome, awesome!

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.570
With this setup, I won't lose to a
Lancer Evo or a GTR or anything!

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.350
<i>Incredible...</i>

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.720
<i>The car's underbody and power output should</i>
<i>be quite different from the previous setup...</i>

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.020
<i>He's instantly able to exert this level of control?</i>

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.830
<i>You've really gotten good at</i>
<i>controlling the accelerator, Keisuke.</i>

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.580
It feels great.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.680
There's plenty of horsepower...

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.020
And the torque really kicks in at
mid-level RPMs, making it easy to drive.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.690
This thing's high-speed cornering
has really gotten great.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:49.400
I think it's because of the wide body,
but this wing is really effective, too.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.730
Corners I couldn't open up the
accelerator on when oversteering

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.140
are now totally stable.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.770
With this, I don't have to fear <i>any</i> opponent!

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.810
I'll bet more and more races on cornering!

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.880
The timing couldn't be better, eh?

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.080
According to Ryosuke, your next
opponent will be your toughest one yet.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.920
Huh. Even tougher than the Toudou School?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.990
Yeah. So it seems.

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.790
I look forward to it, what kind of racer he'll be.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.430
I was just thinking I'd like to get
into a good, solid scuffle of a race.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.970
The Saitama area was pretty much
a string of small-time opponents.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.000
That being said, there were
some good moments for me.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.740
I was able to tackle some of my
assigned tasks at a leisurely pace.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.180
Yeah. I guess we could
think of the Saitama area

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.350
as being a training stage for
you to improve your skills.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.650
As I see it, there's no doubt
that you've gotten much better.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:50.030
I guess. Even I think I've come quite a ways.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:56.930
To me, the expedition wasn't too exciting,
but it was rich in content. I won't forget it.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.200
I see. Then I'm glad.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.050
Say, Fumihiro...

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:15.880
Do you think my brother calculates all
this when deciding where we go next?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.020
Probably.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.200
All of Ryosuke's decisions
have a reason behind them.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.570
I wonder if, to my brother, Fujiwara
and I are still just babes-in-arms.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.970
Don't worry about that sort of thing.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.840
Yeah...

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.250
It can be vexing, but I've got myself
one heck of an older brother.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.860
Our next expedition will be Ibaraki, huh?

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.690
Yes. I've already taken a look.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.660
No matter who I face, I don't think I'll lose.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:03.860
With this, I'll race so fast it'll
make my brother's head spin!
