--Awesome!

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.330
Sure enough, in a simultaneous dash,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.900
an FR probably has the advantage over an FF.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.340
That'd be because of the difference
in their drive systems, huh?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.580
I assume this is according to plan,
what's just happened.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.480
Indeed.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.510
That Eight-Six has some
rather impressive acceleration,

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.080
but I'm suspicious as to whether
Tomoyuki stepped all the way on the gas.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.090
From here to the first corner
it's a battle of just a few seconds,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.590
but it could greatly affect
the course of the entire race.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.510
Okay. Understood.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.550
You ain't gonna believe
what's happened, Kyoichi.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.620
Those Project D guys used the Eight-Six!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.020
I mean, this course has got
an uphill and a downhill,

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.060
so I thought for sure they'd use the FD.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.570
<i>Why, Ryosuke? Why did you ignore my</i>
<i>warning and insist on using the Eight-Six?</i>

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.700
<i>This race isn't going to be</i>
<i>some walk in the park!</i>

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.630
Going on the offensive from the beginning
certainly led to an advantageous start...

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.230
...but it is not as simple as that.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.470
The area from this starting point to the
first corner is one of all-out acceleration,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.610
and it divulged plenty of
information to our opponent.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.910
Accelerating from zero clearly
reveals a car's potential.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.850
If one were to remain slightly
behind and observe closely,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.850
the Eight-Six's racing capabilities
would be plain to see...

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.420
Not absolute engine power, but
everything from gear configuration

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.660
to output characteristics
relating to RPM acceleration.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.460
Having once shown all our cards,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.260
the chances of a tactical
victory over a pro racer are nil.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.470
If tactics are no good, why bother racing?

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.800
What about driving techniques?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.710
Even Fujiwara would be unable to defeat
a pro racer using such techniques.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.770
Furthermore, his car's capabilities
would provide no advantage.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.450
As far as I can tell, there are no
shortcomings with our opponent's EK-9.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.350
Power-wise, it is either on par with
or above Fujiwara's Eight-Six.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.560
What?! Then...

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.330
From the start, you thought this was a
race we couldn't possibly win? Ryosuke!

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.300
Don't leap to conclusions, Fumihiro.
That's not what I am saying.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.900
There is just one thing...

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.140
...in which Fujiwara is second to none,
even when compared to a pro driver.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.320
It is that upon which I am betting, and it
is why I chose Fujiwara and not Keisuke.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.390
There is no such thing as a race
that Project D simply cannot win.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.850
We fight with the pride of street specialists!

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.580
The strategy for this course can be
roughly divided into four sections.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.550
Right after the start is a narrow
stretch of area with no center line.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.890
If you're going to bet the race on anything,
it will be the next section after that.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.760
With the right amount of road width,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.630
someone like Tomo could
lay down a trap anywhere.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.400
From the second section onward,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.200
the course widens up and
there's more room to navigate.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.600
Doing one complete circuit
is what will win the race,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.440
but when they return to this starting point,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.270
the thing to watch for is
the distance between them.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.720
<i>This road is narrow and has poor visibility,</i>
<i>but from here it will suddenly change.</i>

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.620
<i>Coming up is the new second section, where</i>
<i>construction to widen the road has finished.</i>

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.730
<i>It looks good, but the road surface is terrible.</i>

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.600
<i>Joint lines in the asphalt are</i>
<i>bumpy and will toss you around.</i>

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.670
<i>It looks like it's got a lot of power,</i>
<i>but that Eight-Six has old suspension.</i>

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.000
<i>I wonder how far it will even be able to go.</i>

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:11.660
<i>So it can stay in complete control even</i>
<i>when tossed around by bumpy roads, eh?</i>

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.430
<i>Well, not too bad. The Eight-Six</i>
<i>has some pretty solid suspension,</i>

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.830
<i>but it's not enough to hide</i>
<i>that it's having a hard time.</i>

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.170
<i>I don't get it.</i>

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.440
<i>Just what is the point of this race?</i>

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.940
<i>The answer I'm looking for</i>
<i>couldn't be in a place like this!</i>

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.720
Keisuke.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.970
<i>Okay, dammit. Fine!</i>

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.070
It seems they've entered the second section.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.840
Ah. Understood.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.550
Keisuke. Where have you been
and what have you been doing?

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.640
I was in my FD pouting. But I started
feeling like an idiot, so I came out.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.680
You want to ask my reasoning. Don't you?

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.870
<i>We've passed the high-point corner.</i>

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.440
<i>Coming up is the tight, downhill third section.</i>

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.380
<i>I wonder how far this</i>
<i>Eight-Six will tag along...</i>

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:46.380
<i>It won't be able to keep up for long.</i>
<i>I have experience with this, as a pro!</i>

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.200
<i>This is ridiculous. Any more</i>
<i>time than this is just a waste.</i>

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.970
<i>Even before I started, I knew the answer</i>
<i>I was looking for wouldn't be here.</i>

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.370
<i>I should just step up and end this thing now.</i>

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.280
<i>If I get out in front of that Eight-Six...</i>

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.370
<i>...it's all over!</i>

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.990
I can't move forward unless I
can think things out for myself.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.490
In my FD with the engine off,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.000
I cooled down a bit and worked
through some reasons of my own.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.430
And before long, I had it.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.640
When I heard we were going up against
a pro racer, I got too worked up over it.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.570
I thought about it too much, to where
even I thought it was getting dangerous...

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.680
...and honestly, I was
scared I'd get into a wreck.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.850
If I'd raced in that state, the outcome
would not have been good.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.910
You thought that too, right?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.790
It was a consideration, yes. But the
real factor is somewhat different.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.990
Frankly, speed all boils down to experience.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.490
Pro racers always keep in mind
to try to trim their lap time,

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.500
so they have a time awareness

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:08.840
that no hillside racer could possibly reach,
no matter how much he practices.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.140
The number of training runs and the
quality of racing is completely different.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.940
As part of D's activities,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.810
and in order to perfect my
theories on street racing,

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.550
I am attempting two completely different
approaches in pursuit of the same goal.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.990
It is for this reason that D has two drivers.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.460
If there's such a thing as a talent for driving,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:34.030
it means bein' able to improve a little
faster than a guy who hasn't got it.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:38.630
There's no such thing as an instinctive
"gift" that could outdo accumulated effort.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.300
At least, I've never seen
somethin' like that, not once.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.370
One driver will employ an orthodox style,
applying motor sports techniques

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.210
cultivated on the circuit
toward street racing...

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.580
And the other driver...

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.220
...will be a pure street specialist,
a product of the streets!

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.420
His will be an irregular style,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.580
the result of high-speed racing on
only one stage: the mountain pass.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.060
Do you understand, Keisuke?

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.370
Our opponent this time
is of the orthodox style.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.270
An exceptional one at that.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.170
This does not mean that
you are inferior to Fujiwara.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.510
Do you understand Daiki, Sakai?
Winning or losing boils down to experience.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.710
And if that's the reason you guys lost,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.080
it's the same reason that
Tomo definitely won't!

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.180
It's about the <i>nature</i> of the racing.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.120
Therein lies the only chance
of beating a pro racer.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.390
I get it. You thought about all that
when making your choice, huh?

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.760
But if you'd just told us that in the beginning,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.730
we could've gotten things done
without getting all confused.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.040
I apologize for that.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.640
But the ones who are truly confused...

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.570
...are our opponents.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.280
They're headin' into the four
consecutive winding hairpins!

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.850
<i>He passed me here?!</i>

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.000
What the heck?! He passed
Akina's Eight-Six like it was nothin'!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.990
The disappearing line, eh?

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.810
Disappearing line?

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.480
The line at which you disappear from the
field of vision of the car in front of you.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.310
It looks like you're just following the in-line,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:12.550
but actually it's a high-level overtaking
technique often used in circuit races.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.690
You enter the blind spot in your
opponent's rearview mirror

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.060
and, while trimming to as
short a distance as possible,

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.460
bleed over into your opponent's line.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:26.570
If it's timed just right, even another pro
racer would have no way to prevent it.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.370
He pulled it off perfectly, like it was nothing.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.310
In the four consecutive hairpins,
the road widens out

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:42.250
and there are any number of lines
you could take to make your approach.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.920
That makes it close to the same
conditions as the circuit...

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.190
Meaning that as a racing driver,
he'll be right in his element.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.030

About our discussion before, is there
a particular model year you'd like?

Not really. But I don't want some splashy
thing that's got wings on it or something.

dealer acquaintance of mine,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.060

drive and make your choice.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.460
I mean, you in a four-wheel drive...

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.540
<i>Just before this bridge, I'm going to set</i>
<i>a new speed record for this course!</i>

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.710
<i>Once we cross the bridge is the</i>
<i>fourth section, a tough uphill!</i>

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.250
<i>I'll speed ahead and it will be the end!</i>

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.280
<i>He did so-so for an amateur...</i>

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.630
<i>After we cross this bridge comes the uphill.</i>

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.230
<i>If my car doesn't have enough power,</i>
<i>I won't be able to keep up.</i>

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.730
<i>Come on, Eight-Six!</i>
<i>I'm counting on your engine!</i>

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.510
<i>What?!</i>

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.000
<i>He's staying right on my tail.</i>
<i>This is a bit unusual.</i>

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.180
<i>For an FD, which is fast on the straightaway,</i>

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.550
<i>matching the gear ratio to the point on this</i>
<i>course where you can achieve top speed</i>

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.450
<i>will work against you once you reach here.</i>

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.890
<i>The low-speed corners of the hillclimb</i>
<i>section won't match that gear ratio.</i>

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.790
<i>If your opponent drives a turbo,</i>
<i>he'll be able to adjust, but...</i>

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.530
<i>I never thought they'd use the Eight-Six.</i>

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.500
<i>It's a crime! Their leader's</i>
<i>a smart one, all right.</i>

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.670
<i>It wasn't apparent on the downhill,</i>
<i>but on the hillclimb it's all too clear.</i>

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.540
<i>That Eight-Six behind me has</i>
<i>a better gear configuration.</i>

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:27.380
<i>Corners that I'm taking in</i>
<i>second gear, he's taking in first.</i>

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:37.660
<i>But more importantly...</i>

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.360
<i>...ever since I overtook the Eight-Six,</i>

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.060
<i>his concentration has</i>
<i>definitely been on the rise.</i>

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:27.070
<i>He's done a good job keeping up with me.</i>
<i>I feel like I'm watching a younger me.</i>

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.610
<i>At this rate, he definitely won't</i>
<i>free up any space. What do I do?!</i>

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.450
<i>I should make it so he can't see me!</i>

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.220
<i>If I disappear from his field of vision,</i>
<i>the way he did to me earlier...</i>

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.990
<i>All I can do is try!</i>

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.460
<i>Now!</i>

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.240
<i>He's gone!</i>

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.680
<i>The Eight-Six has disappeared</i>
<i>from my mirrors!</i>

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.150
<i>That's not the sound of my car.</i>

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.420
<i>That's where he is?!</i>

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.080
<i>What?!</i>

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.770
<i>He got me.</i>

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.970
<i>He used the disappearing line</i>
<i>I just showed him, eh?</i>

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:38.610
<i>This is the first time a car I've passed has</i>
<i>then passed me, and on a mountain road.</i>

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:43.480
<i>I'm starting to get it.</i>
<i>What Mr. Toudou wanted to show me...</i>

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.010
<i>But I'm not going to pull any punches!</i>

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.960
--They're here!
--The Eight-Six is in front?!

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.540
<i>We're coming up to the fourth winding hairpin.</i>

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.670
<i>I'll show you. In box car racing,</i>
<i>there's this kind of bashing, too!</i>

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.530
<i>I'm not pushing him hard enough to spin him.</i>

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:37.530
<i>I just want to throw him</i>
<i>off balance for a moment.</i>

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.780
<i>Sorry, chump. This sort of thing happens</i>
<i>every day in the pro racing world!</i>

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.280
Ryosuke, please tell me.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.350
When you let Fujiwara sit in
the passenger seat of your FC,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.790
what kind of advice did you give him?

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.720
I gave him no advice.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.760
I simply showed him...

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.800
...the strategy for the course I
had made based on my own run.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.260
He races now with an intuitive understanding

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.270
of how his racing differs from mine.

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.440
S-So then...

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.210
Fujiwara took the strategy you'd
made after you ran the course first

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.140
and that's what he's racing with?

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.480
<i>We're almost to the goal.</i>

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.080
<i>If he gets away from me here,</i>
<i>there's no way I'll get a second chance.</i>

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.990
<i>That again?</i>

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.580
<i>I won't fall for the same trick twice!</i>

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.930
The Eight-Six isn't coming!

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.300
What the heck?! The Eight-Six
is racin' with his headlights off!

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.300
Huh?! The Eight-Six's headlights are off?

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.920
<i>There he is! He's keeping up!</i>

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.620
<i>He's not in my mirrors,</i>
<i>but he's definitely behind me!</i>

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.490
<i>This is crazy!</i>

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.790
<i>Who goes racing around a mountain road</i>
<i>in the pitch dark with his headlights off?!</i>

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.640
<i>I can't look at his tail lights...</i>

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.180
<i>Look only at the road lit up</i>
<i>by the car in front of me!</i>

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.210
<i>I just have to concentrate only</i>
<i>on burning the image into my mind</i>

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:30.340
<i>and superimposing the line</i>
<i>that Ryosuke showed me.</i>

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.530
<i>This is too much. To think I'd get shown</i>
<i>up like this... You're pretty incredible.</i>

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:45.230
<i>But in this last section, there's no</i>
<i>point where you can pull out ahead.</i>

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.040
<i>Victory is mine!</i>

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.910
They say the Eight-Six's headlights are off!

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.250
<i>Incredible. I didn't teach him that.</i>

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.650
<i>It's his own original move.</i>

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.590
<i>This is the thing about Fujiwara</i>
<i>upon which I was betting.</i>

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:12.420
<i>When he's cornered and the situation</i>
<i>becomes grim, he awakens... evolves!</i>

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.930
<i>The goal is just ahead. I've won for sure.</i>

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.000
<i>I won't give up! If there's any opening,</i>
<i>I'm definitely taking it!</i>

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.830
Um...

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.060
Why did you yield the line?

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.730
Just before the last corner.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.170
Oh, there.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:35.010
There's no big reason.
There was something in the road.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.410
I reflexively avoided it.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.280
Well, this is how it goes
when luck's not on your side.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.320
Plus, there was the slope of
the uphill toward the goal...

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.280
There was?

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.860
Ah. I guess you wouldn't have seen it, huh?

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.360
Um, I...

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.920
You won.

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.030
If there is a Lady Luck out there,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:06.770
then you had what it takes today to move her.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.710
Today, I lose.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:29.530
Thank you very much. I understand
now what you were trying to tell me.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.700
Tomo...

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.730
To keep your motivation as a pro high,

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.370
you need to have a starting
point you can go back to.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.210
Next time I'm hurt and suffering,
I know now where to return to.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.510
I feel refreshed right now.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.240
Is that so?

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740
