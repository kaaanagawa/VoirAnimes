00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.570
If he'd gone in front, the race prob'ly
would've been over in a second!

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.560
Isn't that kinda killin' his advantage?

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.580
B-But that Eight-Six ain't exactly slow!

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.440
Yeah, you're right.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.350
Maybe it's just me, but it seemed super fast...

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.960
I believed he would take the starting position,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.570
but he chose to come from behind, eh?
Impressive. A wise choice.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.200
Big brother?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.970
You told Fujiwara something on the phone
earlier before the race started, right?

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.240
What kind of advice did you give?

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.540
It was nothing that would
warrant being called "advice."

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.410
I merely gave him two basic instructions.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.250
Such as?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.990
I said no matter what, do not look in the
rearview mirror till the end of the first race.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.920
The rearview mirror? In other words,
don't look behind you?

"Act 4: Two Pieces of Advice"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.510
<i>Yesterday, someone said</i>
<i>that racing by outside rules</i>

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.840
<i>would be nice and fun or something.</i>

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.750
<i>Shit! This is no joke!</i>

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.320
<i>At this guy's level, he could participate in</i>
<i>Toudou School races and even hold his own!</i>

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.410
<i>Who the hell is he?!</i>

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.800
<i>I'm shocked, and not in a small way!</i>

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.670
<i>There's never been anyone who</i>
<i>could run this course a single night</i>

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.500
<i>and get to this level of mastery,</i>
<i>not even at the Toudou School!</i>

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.670
<i>What's more, I don't know what</i>
<i>kind of tuning his car's gotten,</i>

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.670
<i>but it can go up against my B16 engine,</i>
<i>and is even incredibly good at turning.</i>

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.610
<i>This thing is no Eight-Six!</i>

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.480
<i>If an FR is done up this well,</i>
<i>this is the kind of race it's capable of!</i>

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.030
<i>With this, they've no doubt</i>

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.000
<i>had the advantage in their traveling</i>
<i>battles, winning victory after victory...</i>

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.970
<i>But this time, they're out of luck!</i>

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.210
<i>This is the home course of us, the Toudou School!</i>

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.160
Up till yesterday, we made a lot of
fun of our opponent's Eight-Six...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.770
But right before the start, there was
something about him, a feeling.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.340
That's probably why Daiki
chose to come from behind.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.210
I'm sure I would have made the same choice.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.750
I'd like to see from behind

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.020
what kind of race the "fastest
in the Gunma area" can run.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.020
If it's some lousy racing that
betrays your expectations,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.020
you can tear out ahead and end the race.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.290
Yeah, that you could.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.690
They say he's the best of us
currently racing, right?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.300
What's his specialty?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.560
Daiki's good at braking.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.040
Though when you hear "braking,"
it sounds sort of bland...

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.810
Nah, that ain't bland at all.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.410
There's no better weapon
than that in the downhill!

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.310
If you're a graduate of the Toudou School,
you understand why all too well.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.110
He chose to come behind for the first race?

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.310
Fujiwara, listen closely.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.080
Do not look in your rearview mirror,
right up to the end of the first race.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.650
Concentrate solely on your
strategy for the course.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.920
If you run your own race,
you will not be overtaken.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.260
Listen, Fujiwara. No matter what...

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.280
...do not look behind you!

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.200
<i>I've got the general idea of what</i>
<i>that Eight-Six is capable of.</i>

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.770
<i>It's better than I'd thought, but apparently</i>
<i>nothing for me to get worked up about.</i>

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.840
<i>Even with the pride of</i>
<i>the Toudou School on the line,</i>

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.310
<i>I want to finish this in the first race.</i>

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.710
<i>I've gotta tear around him somewhere.</i>

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.050
<i>I'll make my chance by putting</i>
<i>as much pressure on him as I can.</i>

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.950
<i>I want to see how much he can take!</i>

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.510
Awesome! They're so close!

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.340
Their bumpers are gonna hit!

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:02.480
<i>It's common knowledge now that in</i>
<i>this class, the FF is faster than the FR.</i>

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.520
<i>So this guy must have</i>
<i>the most power ful type R.</i>

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.150
<i>I can't just stay behind this Eight-Six forever.</i>

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.190
<i>I will definitely end this in the first race!</i>

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.990
The thing about braking
when going into a corner is,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:20.260
what's more important isn't when you
start to brake, it's when you finish.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.570
If the point at which you finish decelerating
and start to turn is too far or too soon,

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.440
it'll result in lost time.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.250
Guys with good driving skills will
recover well and won't screw it up,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:41.520
but every corner definitely has only one
ideal point for releasing the brake pedal.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:49.560
That's right. Mr. Toudou is always saying that
braking is the most difficult driving skill.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.060
Of course.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.300
Daiki's assessment of that
point is always accurate.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.140
No matter how long a braking maneuver,
the point at which he releases the pedal

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:05.240
is always right on the money.
It's what you call an innate sense.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.790
Daiki...

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.460
These days, ABS has become
standard in the racing world.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.490
That's how efficient the current ABS is.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.640
And yet, the Toudou School
has done away with ABS.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.350
First, you gotta learn how to
brake without relying on ABS.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:48.250
Unless you bludgeon yourself with the
difficulty of braking till you can't stand it,

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:53.860
you'll never understand how to really use ABS.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.620
It's a rule of the Toudou School.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:28.330
<i>This course doesn't have a center line,</i>
<i>but it's still plenty wide.</i>

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.500
<i>There are several points from</i>
<i>which I can overtake him...</i>

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.400
<i>But now what?</i>

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.800
<i>I use braking to wedge myself into</i>
<i>position, but I can't quite make it.</i>

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.530
<i>Who would've thought an FR's</i>
<i>corner entry could be this fast?</i>

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.990
It's awesome how close he's on his tail,
huh? Those are some serious skills.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.030
No matter how ya look at it,
Ninomiya's EK is so much faster!

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.660
An Eight-Six is too slow!

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.360
It's not that simple.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.700
He wouldn't stay neck-and-neck
with some slow dude, would he?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.270
Unless he really believed in that guy's skill,
he wouldn't be on his tail like that.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.010
The guy in that Eight-Six must be super fast.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.510
--For real?!
--Yeah.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.050
Even in a race with other
students from the school,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.920
I've never seen Ninomiya get
that close to someone before.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.360
It's proof that cool, collected Ninomiya
is starting to get unusually fired up.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.300
<i>This guy's got some serious willpower.</i>

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.300
<i>No matter how much pressure</i>
<i>I put on him, he won't budge.</i>

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.930
<i>Even someone from the Toudou School</i>
<i>would surely have reacted to this by now.</i>

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.110
<i>I don't have to look in the rearview mirror</i>

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.880
<i>to know he's staying right close behind me.</i>

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.420
<i>I can feel the pressure on my back,</i>
<i>a prickling so sharp that it hurts.</i>

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.330
<i>Still, having decided not to</i>
<i>look in the rearview mirror</i>

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.420
<i>feels strangely good, lets me concentrate.</i>

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.330
<i>Ryosuke had two instructions.</i>
<i>All I have to do is follow them!</i>

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.290
Big brother, what's the other one?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.590
The second instruction you gave Fujiwara.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.580
The other is...

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.000
...controlled RPMs!

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.500
The Eight-Six has up to 11,000 RPMs.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.640
But I have him not using
the top-end 2,000 RPMs

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.340
and shifting up when he reaches 9,000.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.510
Are you serious?! Why bother
doing something like that?

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.720
Because I don't wish to show our
opponent all the cards in our hand.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.990
As Fujiwara is not yet capable of
executing a more refined strategy...

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.560
...this was the only way I could think of

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.730
that was both simple
and would produce results.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.670
Limiting our strength against such
a powerful enemy is of course a risk,

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.740
but if Fujiwara successfully
evades him for the first race,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.640
we can draw up a simulation
for him to win the competition.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.380
It is an enormous bet, all-or-nothing.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.350
So he's restricting the top-end 2,000 RPMs

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.410
and still outracing that
Toudou School downhiller?!

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.190
When did he acquire that level of technique?

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.000
Fujiwara...

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.990
...converts all of his experiences
into self-improvement!

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.220
To that end, an exceptional degree
of concentration is required.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.860
I get it. That's why you told
him not to look behind...

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.360
So he wouldn't be rocked by
his opponent's pressure tactics

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.850
and lose concentration.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.590
<i>This isn't funny... This is bullshit!</i>

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.160
<i>I didn't see this turn of events coming.</i>

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.600
<i>Choosing to follow in the</i>
<i>first race was a mistake!</i>

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.100
<i>It's like I...</i>

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.330
<i>I'm actually havin' difficulty with this!</i>

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.350
All right, here goes the second race!

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.680
<i>I had him show me plenty</i>
<i>during the first race...</i>

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.850
<i>...both the Eight-Six's racing</i>
<i>capacity and his driving skill!</i>

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.660
<i>It doesn't have enough</i>
<i>speed to keep up with me.</i>

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.490
<i>I'm going to finish this in a flash!</i>

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.730
<i>He's fast!</i>

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.080
<i>He's so fast. This is really bad!</i>

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.350
<i>I've got no wiggle room at all...</i>
<i>I'm really at my limit!</i>

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.090
<i>This is definitely at a faster</i>
<i>pace than the first race.</i>

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.150
<i>Can I really even keep</i>
<i>up with him at this rate?</i>

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.370
Fujiwara will expend considerable powers
of concentration when coming from behind.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.600
His senses are such that he will be able to
deal with speeds he has never experienced.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.540
He should be able to keep up.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.410
In the course of being dragged along
by a local racer faster than himself,

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.540
he will make his enemy's speed
completely and utterly his own.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:07.550
If things proceed according to my simulation,
he will overtake the racer from Toudou School.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.360
<i>I'm counting on you, Fujiwara.</i>
<i>Rely on your senses!</i>

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.720
<i>What's going on?!</i>

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.290
<i>I should have a clear idea of his</i>
<i>max speed from the first race!</i>

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.830
<i>But he's definitely racing</i>
<i>above that speed now!</i>

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.830
<i>There's no way he should be able to keep up!</i>

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.630
<i>So what's he doing there?!</i>

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.900
<i>I'm scared!</i>

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.810
<i>Up till now, I've never thought that</i>
<i>doing the downhill could be this scary.</i>

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.610
<i>If I let off the gas, it'll all be over.</i>

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.310
<i>It would be easy...</i>

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.310
<i>But the other part of me is saying,</i>
<i>"Don't you dare let off!"</i>

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.930
Is that for real?!

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.830
All right.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.030
I just heard from the guys at the first hairpin,

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.770
and it looks like there's no space
at all between the two cars.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.130
What does that mean?! This is bad.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.200
<i>I can't shake him off!</i>

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.830
<i>This is at a much faster pace than the</i>
<i>first race, but he's keeping right up!</i>

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.470
If Fujiwara can keep up in this second race,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.510
a certain advantageous element will
present itself as he enters the second half.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.350
Do you know what that is?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:12.080
Uh, no. I don't have a clue.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.550
And you, Keisuke?

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.420
I get it, for the most part.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.590
It's the difference in drive systems, right?

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.990
With the FR, the rear tires do
the job of accelerating the car...

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.400
But in the FF's case, in corner entries

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.230
and also when it accelerates,
only the front tires get worked.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.380
A downhill attack places load on
front tires that are already taxed.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.580
The tires of the front-wheel drive
EK-9 will start feeling the strain first.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.280
<i>Dammit!</i>

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.890
<i>Unbelievable! I thought I could</i>
<i>settle this in the first race</i>

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.800
<i>and pushed my car too hard</i>
<i>along unreasonable angles!</i>

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.630
<i>That was an incredible mistake.</i>

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:05.400
<i>It's put excess strain on the tires.</i>

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.910
The RPM limitation was a confusion tactic.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:12.810
A driver of that caliber would be able
to accurately grasp the capabilities

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.150
of the car driving ahead of him--

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.480
in other words,
determine he could overtake it

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.550
and plan a short, decisive battle.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.450
So you wanted to put added
wear on his tires and brakes?

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.290
That's incredible, bro.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.460
To think that those two pieces of
advice had such deep thought to them...

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.130
The important part is yet to come.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.070
The Eight-Six's tires can't
hold out that long either.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.900
It's unknown whether he can make use of

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.800
the slight chance he has been given.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.850
<i>It's not just my imagination.</i>

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.620
<i>His corner entry has suddenly gotten sloppier.</i>

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.620
<i>His tires?</i>

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:06.300
<i>The tires are causing heat shear...</i>
<i>but mine still have strength left in them!</i>

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:12.360
<i>I can tear past this fast EK and end the race!</i>

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.980
If it were you, where would you start looking
for the point to strike in this situation?

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.780
On any mountain pass, the more you
run it, the more there will be points

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.720
where the gear ratio simply will not match.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.490
For example, a point where,
as you accelerate toward a corner,

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.190
you waver between shifting up or not.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.830
I get that much, but what if your
tachometer's in the red zone,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.230
but you don't have enough room
to shift gears and accelerate?

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.900
In cases like that, you do nothing
and just grin and bear it, right?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.670
That sure is terrible.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.480
It's like your hands are tied,
unable to speed up or slow down, huh?

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.250
Oh! So that's it!

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.410
I've got it!

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.250
The Eight-Six's engine has
more RPMs than the EK9's!

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.420
That engine's got some
kind of ace up its sleeve.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.100
Advising him to rein in
the top-end 2,000 RPMs

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.840
and not showing them to the opponent...

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.830
That was the real objective!

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.880
<i>What?!</i>

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.910
<i>He passed me!</i>

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.820
<i>Braking is my specialty, but...</i>

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.910
<i>...it let him pass me!</i>

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.920
Daiki...

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.520
I'm sorry. He beat me.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.790
What the hell's going on?! I don't believe it!

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.350
You, a local, lost?

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.260
Well done, Fujiwara. You really did a good job.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.350
<i>I'm glad. I got so worked up that</i>
<i>I'm dripping with cold sweat...</i>

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.620
<i>Ryosuke almost never makes that sort of face.</i>

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.030
<i>I was able to follow through</i>
<i>with what Ryosuke had hoped.</i>

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.130
<i>And I'm glad. I really am.</i>

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.180
Please do your best, Keisuke.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.920
<i>Of course I will. I'm going on the</i>
<i>attack, right from the first race.</i>

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.770
All right, now beginning the hill climb!

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.750
