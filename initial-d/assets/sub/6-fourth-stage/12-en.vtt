<i>...there's no way I'm letting you go!</i>

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.980
Do you think Fujiwara is planning
a counterattack after all?

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.920
Perhaps. However, launching a
counterattack will not result in victory.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.650
As for whether he will realize that...

"Act 12: Straightaway of Struggles"

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.370
<i>Dammit! In this night rain and with</i>
<i>the spray of water I'm sending up,</i>

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.400
<i>he should be completely unable</i>
<i>to see from that side ditch,</i>

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.200
<i>so how can he keep up with me so precisely?!</i>

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.220
<i>Relax! First things first.</i>
<i>I have to be calm here.</i>

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.120
<i>If I lose my cool and my rhythm</i>
<i>gets thrown off, it could be deadly!</i>

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.790
<i>Okay, he's on my tail and I can't shake him.</i>

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.660
<i>I just need to switch strategies</i>
<i>to one that can't lose!</i>

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.250
<i>This spray has reduced my</i>
<i>visibility to almost nil. Still...</i>

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.910
<i>It's strange, but I don't feel scared.</i>

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.320
Do you remember the
blind attack Fujiwara used

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.490
in the second race against the Toudou School?

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.260
Yeah. There's no way to
forget something like that.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.330
Turning off the headlights and racing
a mountain pass in the dark...

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.870
Fujiwara is currently being supported by
the same manner of technique and ability.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.330
Such as?

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.270
Even when there is inadequate
visual information,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.110
he can supplement it with the
image that appears in his mind.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.610
When it comes to this ability,
Fujiwara is quite outstanding.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.680
He can instantly gauge top speed

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.810
and can unerringly race road
surfaces devoid of markers...

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.020
All because of his mental image.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.460
That could be the source of what supports
Fujiwara's genius-like technique.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.470
What? The Eight-Six is right on him?!

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.700
Really?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.670
Where are they now?

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.510
The stretch of winding roads by the steel tower.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.740
At this rate, it's too tough
to call just by the first race.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.050
I can't comment until I hear
what Sakamoto has to say.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.750
In any case, we'll have to come up
with a strategy for the second race.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.160
A simulation with the Cappuccino
coming from behind, huh?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.660
What a setback.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.600
<i>I didn't think there would</i>
<i>even be a second race...</i>

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.900
<i>All because of the rain, eh?</i>

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.840
<i>Unlike Sakamoto, who has only raced</i>
<i>in the Capuccino for a few days,</i>

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.370
<i>our opponent knows his</i>
<i>Eight-Six inside and out</i>

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.270
<i>and can control it like an</i>
<i>extension of his own body!</i>

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.040
<i>If only the course were dry. But this rain...</i>
<i>The Eight-Six is using it to its advantage!</i>

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.370
<i>I've had a bad feeling since earlier.</i>

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.430
<i>A sensation like he's planning</i>
<i>something is coming to me in waves.</i>

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.140
<i>But on this narrow course, and in the rain...</i>

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.110
<i>What the hell is he thinking?!</i>

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.250
<i>Quit screwing around!</i>

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.710
<i>Don't go planning something reckless.</i>
<i>Just stay there and behave!</i>

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.250
<i>Here!</i>

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.430
<i>What?!</i>

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.780
<i>I told you to quit screwing around!</i>

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.910
<i>No good!</i>

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.930
<i>Looks like countering an opponent who</i>
<i>can corner faster than you is impossible.</i>

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.630
<i>No. One more time.</i>

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.590
<i>Somewhere at these consecutive</i>
<i>corners coming up, I'll try again.</i>

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.770
<i>This next time will be my last chance.</i>

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.010
<i>If Ryosuke says I can do it,</i>
<i>then I can definitely do it!</i>

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:42.730
Just a little longer...

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.290
Yes.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.400
<i>Even now, I can't forget...</i>

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.810
<i>...the shock and impact at being</i>
<i>passed by Fujiwara in the rain at Myogi.</i>

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.690
<i>I don't know how much of an</i>
<i>advantage having a light car is...</i>

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.320
<i>...but I just can't imagine</i>
<i>Fujiwara losing in the rain!</i>

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.600
<i>Go!</i>

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.640
<i>I diot! He's cutting in too close!</i>

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.940
<i>That bastard's dug our graves!</i>

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.110
<i>I'm gonna fall in!</i>

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.670
<i>I did it.</i>

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.110
<i>I don't know how I pulled that off,</i>
<i>but it was really lucky.</i>

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.980
<i>Still, that mistake just now</i>
<i>pulled me a little farther back.</i>

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.150
<i>I guess a counterattack is</i>
<i>no good. It just won't work!</i>

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:44.180
<i>But if that's the case...</i>

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.690
For example, the methods of
Kyoichi Sudou of Team Emperor.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.660
Something like that would be effective.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.700
Don't forget, having a
completely different mindset

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.530
will be the key to winning this battle.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.340
<i>So if it's not a counterattack,</i>

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.170
<i>then Ryosuke...</i>

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.510
I see. Understood.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.820
My advice may have been
difficult to understand...

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.020
But the fact that Fujiwara is currently
able to keep pace with the Cappuccino

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.290
probably means that,
while not fully comprehending,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.030
he has brought the gist of it into play.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.900
Yes. But will he be all right?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.070
If he could keep up during the opening and
middle sections of the race, he'll be fine.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.700
I think those were the most difficult.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.410
--And he springs the trap...
--Yes, at the very end.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.880
He'll pull ahead at the place where
the enemy's greatest weapon,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.050
being lightweight, ceases to be a weapon.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.880
That's where Kyoichi would
take precise control.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.840
Because it's the safest,
most certain way to pull ahead.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.360
But will the enemy simply fall for
that safest, most certain way?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.990
That is the greatest problem he will face.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:19.950
<i>He'll come! This flat straightaway</i>
<i>just ahead is my greatest weakness.</i>

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.410
<i>No matter what, I can't let</i>
<i>myself be passed here!</i>

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.210
<i>Whatever tactic I have to use, I'll show</i>
<i>you I can make it to the second race!</i>

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:45.070
<i>Is this the straightaway just before the goal?</i>
<i>If I want to go, this would be my chance.</i>

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.910
<i>But something's bothering me.</i>

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.980
<i>If I fail twice at cornering but</i>
<i>pull ahead right before the end...</i>

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.310
<i>Can I really call that winning?</i>

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.550
<i>Would Ryosuke praise me</i>
<i>for something like that?</i>

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.320
<i>I don't know... But I'm out of time.</i>
<i>I can't afford to hesitate!</i>

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.990
<i>What do I do? Do I go?</i>

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.300
<i>Or do I just do nothing and</i>
<i>let it go into the second race?</i>

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.730
<i>What's the right answer?!</i>

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.290
<i>Will he come from the right?</i>
<i>Or maybe from the left?</i>

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.490
<i>Here, I can't utilize this</i>
<i>thing's small frame anymore.</i>

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.930
<i>Even if I run in the middle of the road, it</i>
<i>still opens up space on the right and left.</i>

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.830
<i>I don't really care for doing it like this,</i>
<i>but I can't give up any road!</i>

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:54.510
<i>What do I do?! Which way of winning</i>
<i>is the one that Ryosuke wants?</i>

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.640
<i>The left, huh?!</i>

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:06.350
<i>There's no way I'm lettin' you in front of me!</i>

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.450
<i>I have to save face in front of my peers, too!</i>

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.860
<i>He'll go that far, will he?</i>
<i>If that's how he wants to play it...!</i>

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.970
There they are! They're coming, Iketani!

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.970
What?!

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.820
<i>Takumi's Eight-Six is gone!</i>

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.220
<i>If you're thinking about riding it out into</i>
<i>the next race, that is a mistake, Fujiwara.</i>

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.830
<i>Don't insist on a "pretty" victory.</i>

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.530
<i>Having such self-centered</i>
<i>fixations will only limit oneself...</i>

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:57.570
<i>And being limited leads to the end of growth.</i>

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.510
<i>If you feel resistance to pulling</i>
<i>ahead on the straightaway,</i>

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.240
<i>that is hubris and dependency!</i>

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.050
<i>How one wins does not require style!</i>

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.020
<i>Go, Fujiwara!</i>

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.220
<i>It's gone!</i>

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.520
<i>The Eight-Six is gone from my mirrors!</i>

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.420
<i>That's impossible. It can't be!</i>

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.690
<i>His headlights were right on me a second ago.</i>

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.590
<i>I don't get it!</i>

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.240
<i>What?!</i>

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.030
Sakamoto got passed... The Eight-Six won!

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.690
<i>Impossible...</i>

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.630
<i>He finished it in the first race?!</i>

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.310
I said it from the first, did I not?
A completely different mindset.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.820
The driver's job is to draw out a
car's latent potential to its very limits.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.990
If one were to describe the essence
of it, that's what it boils down to.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:01.390
Beyond racing fast, if there is one
key to beating an opponent's car,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.300
it is simply to turn this sentiment
into a weapon and to attack.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.970
This way of thought is what I wanted
you to experience in today's race.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.310
Telling you to recall Kyoichi's
methods meant not just his technique,

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:19.310
but also included the
meaning of this psychology.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.980
Today's race was for the most part
decided until the halfway point.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:27.650
Good work sticking close to him, and not
being thrown off during that section.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.390
You did well. Just relax and enjoy yourself.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.920
The time trial has been cancelled.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.930
That turned out well, huh?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.870
I... Did I just get praised?

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:51.040
To be honest, I only sort of accept it.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.080
Did I really do well in passing him like that?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.750
Right up till the end, I really felt lost.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.420
I thought about doing nothing
and riding it out till the second race.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.620
It's a good thing you didn't.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.630
Ryosuke would definitely
have gotten angry at you.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.060
Really?

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.700
Of course!

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.700
There's no guarantee conditions would've
stayed the same for the second race.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.310
Don't forget, half the help
you got was from the rain.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.710
If it had stopped raining, it would've been
impossible to keep up with the Cappuccino.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.780
Oh... I guess you're right.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.620
If you'd been racing on your own, you'd
be free to choose whichever you like,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.390
but right now you're racing
as a representative of D.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:36.980
Don't forget that.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.270
I can't believe it. How could you lose?!
And under these conditions!

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.900
I just can't believe it!
What the hell happened?!

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.840
I don't know. I don't get any of it.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.080
On the straightaway right in front of
the goal, he just suddenly disappeared.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.650
He cleverly went into
the mirrors' blind spot, eh?

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.080
If that were the case, I would've
noticed before he'd pulled alongside.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.920
I barely had time to go "Huh?"
before he was right there beside me.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.690
Hey, get a hold of yourself.
What are you on about?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.490
You're not some amateur!

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:16.430
Say what you like, but if I
don't get it, I don't get it!

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.030
This has shocked <i>me</i> the most!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.130
Yeah, you've got a point.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:25.210
You guys couldn't beat
that Eight-Six either, right?

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.370
Man, I've had enough of this.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.540
I've completely lost confidence in myself.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.710
It doesn't look like I'll be
recovering from this for a while.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.680
There's something fundamentally
different about that guy.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.150
He's an incredible driver.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.700
Still, that blind attack in the middle
of the rain was really effective.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.300
The rain already made it hard to see,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.330
so to your opponent, I think it
really felt like you'd disappeared.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:05.880
Ryosuke already said this, but that
tactic is a powerful weapon in a fight.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.850
You may be right...

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:13.090
But personally, I don't think I
want to use it too frequently.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.890
I'd enjoy it too much.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.920
Enjoy it? You would?

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.830
But it would come out spontaneously...

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.400
If an opponent wouldn't open up
any road, I'd do it reflexively.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.600
Or if I got angry...

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.830
Ah, there he is!

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.530
Hey, Takumi!

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.540
Wow, you really gave me a shock earlier!

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.350
Somehow, I completely lost sight
of what your Eight-Six was doing!

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.450
Uh, us too.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.250
Sorry 'bout that!

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:50.360
I almost got hit by the Eight-Six, too!
I'll forgive ya this time, though.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.260
At least I'm not causing a scene...

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.300
That Levin! It can't be!

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.270
That's Wataru's Levin!

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.570
Yeah. You just now noticed that?

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:11.480
Wataru's representing the
other team on the hillclimb.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:17.710
What?! What does that mean?
Don't tell me! Don't tell me!

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.990
K-Kazumi?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.000
Kazumi!

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.330
It's me! Me!

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.740
Itsuki?

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.790
The compressor!
You changed it to a supercharger?

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.470
Yeah. After losing to that guy's Trueno last fall,

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.540
I started feeling dissatisfied
with how my turbo was set up.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.640
I'd just finished putting the engine together

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.280
and after thinking through a couple
of options, this is what I came up with.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.720
The supercharger's direct response is,
if anything, close to NA.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:29.460
It hasn't got the quirks of a turbo, and it
feels like I've put in a large-volume engine.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.360
This thing will be just the trick
for a tight course like today's.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.900
Keep that in mind as you bring your A-game.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.700
I see. I'll have to do that.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.070
I'll friggin' show you what
having a turbo is all about.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.700
Line up your cars! The Levin
goes first, followed by the FD!

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.770
Keisuke, your task has
been set since last week.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:24.410
You understand, yes? Road surface conditions

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.750
are perfect for measuring its effectiveness.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:31.250
Yeah, I know! Just watch
me out there, big brother.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.840
Very well.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.270
Here we go!

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.510
Starting in five seconds!

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:28.980
Four! Three!

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.510
Two! One!

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.000
Go!

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.590
Awesome! For it to be a match
for the FD in the start dash,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.290
Wataru's Levin must really be awesome!

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.830
I installed a turbo in my Levin as well,
but this is completely different!

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.430
My brother's Levin is rebuilt now,
and installed with a supercharger.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.300
A supercharger?

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.700
He ended up blowing out his old engine.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.210
It looked like he really
hated losing to your friend.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.110
He put everything into his racing,
and really pushed himself.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.380
Huh. He did?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.950
Still, a supercharger is a bit unexpected.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:18.520
But he said it suits a car like the Eight-Six.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.460
My brother's very satisfied.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:26.230
He said that his racing power
has improved over his old turbo.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:50.390

<i>mid-speed section coming up,</i>

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.060

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.360
<i>It's a street fight, where the winner is</i>
