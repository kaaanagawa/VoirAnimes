Yeah. They say they're coming...

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.010
I'm incredibly curious.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.450
I wanna see just how good
that famous team is.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.490
I'm happy they're even coming
here to our home course.

Hey, Kyoko!

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.260
Were you even listening? This time
we're going up against Project D!

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.400
And I say we have the hillclimb covered.
You're our team's ace, Kyoko.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.370
Okay, understood.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.700
I'll get myself focused and race.
Just leave the hillclimb to me.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.110
You want me to tell you about
their team's hillclimber?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.370
No, that's fine. I can concentrate
better if I don't hear too many details.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.840
Looks like they've arrived, huh?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.440
That yellow FD is Project D's
hillclimber ace, Keisuke Takahashi.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.440
He's the guy you'll be riding against tomorrow.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.580
K-Keisuke Takahashi...

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.280
What's wrong? You scared?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.220
It couldn't be! He's got an FD, same as you.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.620
The way you race, you can hold
your head high anywhere you go.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.290
Be confident and show 'em how it's done.

<i>Keisuke...</i>

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.560
<i>...Takahashi.</i>

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.230
<i>I don't know what I should do. I never</i>
<i>thought it would turn out this way...</i>

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.930
<i>How could we have met like this?</i>

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.040
Very well, we shall now start our practice runs.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.150
Okay, let's begin.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.280
Five runs at 80%.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.660
A word of warning: your usual
tactics will not be applicable here.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.160
Especially for you, Keisuke.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.390
It was to provide you with strict
training that I chose this course.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.830
Give it your all.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.800
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.170
Preparations are complete!

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.230
All okay here, too.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.950
Those two cars are incredible.
It's a thrill just to look at them.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.250
Hey, quit talkin' like you're a spectator!

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.190
Those are the guys we'll be racing tomorrow!

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.630
What do you plan to do now, Nobuhiko?

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.700
Stay here and watch them till tomorrow.
I already took the day off from work.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.670
A chance like this almost never comes along.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.440
I'll have them give me a
nice, long look at the tactics

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.630
they come up with for our home course.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.140
<i>And after that, I'll come up</i>
<i>with a strategy of my own.</i>

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.480
<i>Those two Project D drivers</i>
<i>certainly are incredible.</i>

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.620
<i>But the really incredible one is</i>
<i>the guy giving out the orders.</i>

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.820
<i>But I'm going to find out...</i>
<i>how to hit them where it hurts!</i>

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.000
<i>This course is sort of hard to run!</i>

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.590
It's really terrible, Fumihiro.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.250
There are all these cracks
and ripples in the asphalt.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.530
And they set off sparks,
like in the old F1 races.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:20.930
I raised the car more than usual and
tried a couple of different configurations,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.100
but nothing really does the trick.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.900
That's how it looks.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.840
The Eight-Six seems to be having a
hard time with its suspension, too.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.510
More to the point, did you notice, Keisuke?

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:34.610
Notice what?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.350
There was a girl in a black FD when we
came to scout the course before, right?

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.010
She was there with the group we'll be racing.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.250
I didn't notice that.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.760
She watched you going out in your FD
with an intensely serious look on her face.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.230
That girl couldn't possibly
be their hillclimber, right?

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.270
You wouldn't think it,
but that might be the case.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.790
After all, she's driving an FD.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.310
Anyway, I could care less
who their hillclimber is.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.740
I think my real opponent will be this course.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.720
That's awesome! It's like a fateful encounter!

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.320
There's nothing awesome
about it. I just want to run away.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.160
Why? A chance like this
almost never comes along!

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.560
Chance?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.000
That's right! You've got the same hobby,
so no matter if you win or lose,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.670
it's still a great chance for
you two to get friendly, right?

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.000
It is?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.800
Yes, of course! You definitely
have to do this, Kyoko.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.080
If you show him how good a driver you are,
he's bound to get interested in you, too.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.410
You can't let him get away.
This is your chance!

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.590
I stuck around yesterday and kept
a close eye on them till dawn,

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:02.530
and sure enough, these guys are top-class.
Especially that downhill Eight-Six.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.830
He's already beyond street-racer level.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.040
We don't have a downhiller
in his league on our team...

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.600
I'll go ahead and challenge him,
but don't get your hopes up.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:17.210
That's why we're going to have
to pin it all on the hillclimb.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.650
And when it comes to the hillclimb, we have
the incredibly talented Kyoko on our team.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.620
Depending on your approach, it will be
possible for you to pull out in front of him.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.130
That's why I've thought up a strategy.
I'm counting on you, Kyoko.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.460
Just leave it to me. I'm feeling
extremely motivated right now.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.770
What's wrong? It's not working?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.680
I-I was racing, and all of
a sudden it lost power...

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.720
With no warning?

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.120
N-No, not like that.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.920
It's felt a bit strange since
the day before yesterday.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.900
I thought maybe it was just my imagination.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:46.540
But the power clearly cut out just now.
I got scared, so I pulled over.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.470
Say, you...

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.070
Are you supposed to do the hillclimb today?

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.710
I was.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.740
But at this rate--

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.310
What a disappointment.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.780
It's like I got the short end of the stick, too.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.290
You have the same FD,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.320
and it looked pretty fast, so I'd
been looking forward to this...

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.600
If your car felt even a little off, why didn't
you check it out while it was still daylight?

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.000
If you think you can win without giving
your machine the proper maintenance,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.670
I'm shocked.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.110
Racing someone with a half-assed
attitude like that is a waste of time!

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.450
<i>I... I...</i>

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.360
Kyoko's FD has stopped?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.930
I heard it was pulled over
with the hood popped up.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.870
It broke down?! What do we do, Nobuhiko?

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.930
For now, let's just go see.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.980
<i>This is pathetic.</i>

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.780
<i>Why couldn't I listen properly</i>
<i>to what my FD was telling me?</i>

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.720
<i>Like an idiot, I went up anyway...</i>
<i>and this is how it turns out?</i>

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.620
<i>This is terrible. And I was so excited!</i>

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.830
<i>From the bottom of my heart,</i>
<i>I wanted to race that man!</i>

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.290
<i>Everything's ruined. He completely hates me.</i>

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.980
Hey, your car can still run, right?
Quit spacing out and hang a U-turn.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.930
As I thought, a pipe's slipped off.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.230
The intercooler hose
has probably deteriorated.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.070
Can you fix it?

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.870
I think I can manage something.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.670
I brought a whole range
of parts for this section.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.080
Okay, do it. On the double!

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.680
Can it be fixed?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.090
Probably. He brought the
whole minivan full of parts.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.110
That's just like Keisuke, all right.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.460
Say, Ryosuke.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.470
You said you chose this course to
give Keisuke some "strict training,"

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.130
but you meant that seriously
and not as a joke, right?

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:38.370
It was serious. He has mastered
aggressive full-throttle acceleration,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.810
but sometimes that alone lends
itself to too many victories.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.710
He also tends to prefer clean courses,
so this place will be more than a handful.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.820
A fiery fighting spirit matched with
pedal work delicate and cold as ice...

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.810
That is Keisuke's current assignment!

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.260
She's not here!

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.230
That's strange.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.310
The boost is working perfectly. This won't let
you complain about not having any power!

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.450
Um, I really don't know what to say...

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.850
That's fine. There's no need
to say thanks or anything.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.290
Just return the sentiment in our race.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.960
All right, let's move out.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.590
Understood.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.800
Well, he sort of got us there.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.330
He may be our rival, but that was <i>too</i> cool!

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.140
<i>I like him... I like him so much!</i>
<i>I can't control myself!</i>

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.650
You want to take the lead?

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.150
It's good that you're going on
the offensive, but tactics-wise,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.690
I wonder If it wouldn't be better for you
to come from behind for the first race.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.560
As far as I can tell, their guy in the
FD isn't used to this kind of course.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.400
I'm sorry. But please let me do this my way.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.490
I'm determined to take the lead!

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.840
Um, I...

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.380
I'm Kyoko Iwase. It's a pleasure.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.210
I'm Keisuke Takahashi of Project D.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.350
Keisuke.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.360
I have just one word of advice.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:37.560
If something strikes you as odd in
the middle of the race, remember this:

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.700
Your opponent drives a single turbine.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.030
Huh?

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.900
<i>What is that?! I don't know what it even means!</i>

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.700
Let's begin. Fumihiro.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.360
Okay.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.550
Very well, here comes the start!

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.620
Go!

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.140
Say, Nobuhiko, what was the real
strategy you'd thought up for Kyoko?

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.570
That doesn't matter anymore.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:28.380
I could talk and lecture,

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.810
but Kyoko is the type who'll race
only out of pure motivation.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.080
She probably felt indebted
to him for fixing her car,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.220
so she wanted to attack him head-on
without resorting to cheap tricks.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.450
That's Kyoko's way.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.730
<i>She's good. She's really good... But why?!</i>

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.240
<i>Is she enough of an opponent</i>
<i>to really make me struggle?</i>

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.180
<i>I don't get it. Am I racing that badly?</i>

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.770
<i>Or are my car's settings off?!</i>

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.860
<i>Calm down... Don't get riled up. Just stay cool.</i>

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.260
<i>This has only just started!</i>

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.440
<i>It's strange.</i>

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.310
<i>Tackling the mountain pass has</i>
<i>never felt so fulfilling before.</i>

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.050
<i>Even though, no matter what I try,</i>
<i>I could never beat him...</i>

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.550
<i>I just...</i>

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.810
<i>...want him to see.</i>

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.460
<i>To watch me now, and see</i>
<i>the best racing I'm capable of!</i>

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.120
<i>That's why I chose to race in front!</i>

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.630
<i>Right now, I'm the only thing</i>
<i>he's paying attention to.</i>

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.530
<i>And that's enough to make me happy!</i>

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.200
<i>Watch me, my darling!</i>

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.170
<i>This is who I am!</i>

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.840
<i>I'm shocked. She's fast!</i>

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:16.850
<i>I didn't think too much of her 'cause</i>
<i>she's a girl, but I was completely off.</i>

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.760
<i>And knowing that, I'm starting over</i>
<i>again and giving this race my all!</i>

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.090
<i>I don't plan on being beaten</i>
<i>by someone with the same 13B.</i>

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.830
<i>Let's go, my 13B turbo!</i>

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.490
<i>Roar for me!</i>

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.840
I see.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.670
This is a surprise. Now it's
apparently an even fight.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.780
It has long been theory that single turbine
engines can attain sudden explosive power

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.250
when pushed past a certain RPM threshold,
but modern turbines are highly functional

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.710
and will operate rapidly even
when there is little back pressure.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.890
That type of power generation
is well suited to this course,

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.060
no doubt making the car easier to drive.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.760
The person who worked on it knew this
course inside and out, and was quite clever.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.200
By comparison, Keisuke's car is a twin turbo.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.140
Its method of power output
is not suited for this course.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.810
That acts as a handicap, meaning
that at present, this is an even race.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.880
If you knew all that, couldn't you have
given us a little hint during the practice runs

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.820
so we could've done
something with the car's settings?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:30.730
No. To have to rely upon power settings
is to be unfit to be a driver in Project D.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.330
I told you that Keisuke's assignment in this
race had to do with accelerator handling.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.570
The road's surface is in poor condition,
resulting in limited traction

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.660
and making it the ideal stage for
training in accelerator handling.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.840
If we were to assign a level of five
in terms of maximum acceleration

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.180
that Keisuke can currently control...

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.420
...ideally, that will become doubled to level 10.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.120
<i>Level 10?!</i>

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.090
I underwent the same
training myself, long ago.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.660
<i>The space between us opens up</i>
<i>a bit in the straightaways...</i>

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.200
<i>She has more power than me?</i>

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.260
<i>If so, then why is she so stable</i>
<i>when coming out of corners?</i>

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.370
<i>No matter how you look at it,</i>

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.540
<i>I should have more acceleration power,</i>
<i>but I'm having a harder time with this.</i>

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.940
<i>Am I just that bad a driver?</i>

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.680
<i>I don't get it, big brother!</i>

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.690
<i>You said she has a single turbine,</i>
<i>but what does that mean?</i>

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.950
<i>What's different between a single and a twin?!</i>

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.460
<i>Even if we step on the gas at the same point,</i>

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.170
<i>she moves smoothly</i>
<i>while I slide out too much.</i>

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.000
<i>No matter how you look at it,</i>
<i>I'm putting more load on the tires.</i>

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.910
<i>So what do I do?</i>

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.910
<i>Delay my acceleration timing?</i>

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.680
<i>No, that won't work. I'll fall behind.</i>

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.080
<i>It's not the acceleration points I have</i>
<i>to change, it's the way I accelerate!</i>

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880
<i>Maybe more delicately.</i>

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.190
<i>Up till now, I've been stepping</i>
<i>down about two centimeters.</i>

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.690
<i>If I do half of that, one centimeter.</i>

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.760
<i>Take a breath, hold it, one more centimeter...</i>

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:15.260
<i>I'm still stepping too much.</i>
<i>Dammit! This is so hard!</i>

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.600
<i>This is the first time I've tried this</i>
<i>kind of delicate accelerator handling!</i>

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.140
<i>Incredible... I'm tingling!</i>

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.440
<i>I can feel his gaze on my back,</i>
<i>so much that it hurts!</i>

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.440
<i>Right now, beyond a shadow of a doubt,</i>
<i>my darling and I are in our own private world!</i>

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.910
<i>It's wonderful... I don't want it to end.</i>

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.710
<i>I want to keep racing like this forever!</i>

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:16.390
<i>This is a strange feeling. Something</i>
<i>is different from my normal races.</i>

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.790
<i>What is this strange peaceful sensation?</i>

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.730
<i>I was so wound up and full</i>
<i>of tension, but now...</i>

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.600
<i>We're almost to the goal already.</i>

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.470
<i>If I keep going like this,</i>
<i>we'll enter the second race.</i>

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.880
<i>That's it! I get it now, brother!</i>

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.980
<i>That's a single turbine's weak point!</i>
<i>Pitiful... I'm such an idiot!</i>

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.510
<i>Why didn't I realize it sooner?!</i>

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.360
<i>She's definitely fast when</i>
<i>she's running smoothly,</i>

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.370
<i>but if her racing gets thrown off even</i>
<i>momentarily, it makes her vulnerable.</i>

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.630
<i>I can't be sure, but I think a single</i>
<i>turbine is probably a peaky engine!</i>

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.220
<i>She didn't step on the gas</i>
<i>and her boost pressure dropped!</i>

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.650
<i>Yes!</i>

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.650
<i>The twin turbo has a little time lag...</i>

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.350
<i>...and now is when it does its thing!</i>

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.600
<i>No...</i>

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.260
<i>Don't pass me!</i>

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.060
<i>I want to keep racing. I don't want to let it end!</i>

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.030
<i>Don't go... darling!</i>

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740
