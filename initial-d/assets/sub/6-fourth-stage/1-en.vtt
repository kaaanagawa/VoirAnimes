Okay.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.960
Let's begin.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.940
Hello. We're Project D, and we've
come from the Gunma area.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.810
We're called Seven Star Leaf.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.520
Our team mainly runs this course.
You'll be going up against us.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.590
It will be a pleasure. I believe
you've already been informed,

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.820
but do you agree to let us have
this course tonight for training,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.360
with the actual race being tomorrow?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.860
Yeah, I heard. That's fine.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.600
Far as I can see, you've only got
two cars, an FD and an Eight-Six.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.010
Are those the only two you've got?

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.310
We're an expeditionary team.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.880
We've cut down on the number
of cars to eliminate waste.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.880
The Eight-Six handles downhill races...

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.190
...and the FD handles uphills.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.280
They are the twin aces of our team.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.990
Very well, with your
permission we'll now begin.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.130
They're more polite than I expected.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.620
It's sort of a letdown how
friendly they are, huh?

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.210
Racing with just two cars
is unexpected enough,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:04.050
but what the heck are those
three minivans? A support team?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.250
The Eight-Six's underbody
configuration will end up like this.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.420
These guys aren't your normal team.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.560
In a racing team, everyone races, right?

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.230
But having a support crew
tag along for just two cars...

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.070
They may be a team, but they're
more like traveling circuit racers.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.740
I'm not gonna be fooled
by appearances, Atsuro!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.880
What can these guys
possibly do in a single night?!

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.850
Our team's been active for two years.
At even a moderate guess,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.520
we've run this a thousand times!

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.550
Support team or not,
it won't make a difference!

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.420
A race is between two drivers, right?!

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.460
In a battle between 1.6-liter cars,
there's no way I'll lose!

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.260
It's local pride!

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.700
You think I'm gonna be
beaten by some Eight-Six?

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.430
Understood. This is good.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.240
Make it so that, as much as possible,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.270
Fujiwara will voice his opinions
and be made to think for himself.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.410
All right.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.140
I believe he can't say
anything of importance yet,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.250
but what is most crucial now
is that he be made to think.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.880
Understood.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.560
Have you watched the video?

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.160
Yes, about 40 times.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.250
Then you should have the course in your head.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.500
Run the first five times at about 70% speed.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.640
There will be a slight difference

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.270
between the course as envisioned
and how it is when actually racing it.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.480
Your first job will be to
adjust for that discrepancy.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.250
Okay.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.280
Keisuke, you understand as well, yes?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.250
We don't pick up the pace
till this stage is completed.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.790
Yeah, not to worry.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.310
Very well. Go!

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:24.680
I'm headin' out, too. Once I do
up the tires, I'm good to go!

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.360
It's probably like Tohru said.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.670
What can they do in a single night... right?

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.740
That's how we've gotta think.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.050
We can ponder all kinds of stuff,

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.520
but in the end,
when racin' out on the course...

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:02.920

own driving skills and your car!

Because it's almost payday!

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.820
Oh, that's right.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:08.090
It'll be your first paycheck since
becoming a full-time employee.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:12.160
Sure enough, it's a different
feeling from working part-time!

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.400
It feels like I've become an adult!

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.500
And once you get your pay,
what will you spend it on?

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.840
That should be obvious.
I'm adding a turbo to my Eight-Five!

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.840
To your Eight-Five, huh?

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.140

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.770
You're not, huh? For a youngster
like you, that's just depressing!

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.750
Scary...

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.050
There are no covers on the sides!

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.420
I heard about this from Ryosuke,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.590
but this is the first time I've seen one so deep.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:04.130
The roads in the Gunma area
generally have concrete covers.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.970
We ran it at night yesterday,
so it didn't stand out,

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:09.170
but if we fell into that thing at full speed,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.610
make no mistake,
our undersides would be toast.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:18.680
Actually, Ryosuke said
something about this yesterday.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.420
That how we tackle this ditch

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.620
would decide whether we win or lose.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.150
Even saying something like that...

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.520
Maybe he just meant,
make sure you don't fall in.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.000
Anyway...

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.770
A lot of the time, we don't get
what Ryosuke's thinking

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:44.870
right up till the very end. However...

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:50.010
In the end, it always turns
out the way Ryosuke said.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.000
You can believe him.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.490
A 1600 B6 bored up to 1800...

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.990
An installed high-comp piston,
raising the compression ratio,

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.900
a lowered flywheel weight
to increase response,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.860
and finished off with four
throttle body sports injection...

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.000
Too awesome.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.240
Combined with your driving technique,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.170
this is the ultimate downhill B6, I'd say.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.640
With this, there's no way I could lose! For sure!

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.670
Well then, Bunta, you're still
making Takumi do the deliveries?

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.570
Yeah. Nothin's changed from before.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:52.210
You say that, but he's become
an upstanding young man.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.510
He works afternoons now, right?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.680
He doesn't complain about it or nothin', either.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.410
He's doin' an even better job than before.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:08.520
That "Project D" team looks like
it's been good motivation for him.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.260
Yeah. He says they're unbeatable.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.260
Apparently they're making
new records left and right.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:19.130
Yeah, for now. But before long...

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.070
...they'll lose.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.480
It's about to start! My heart's pounding.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.980
How awesome is Project D gonna be?!

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:38.790
In any case, Seven Star Leaf
is gonna take the downhill.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.890
There's no way that Tohru Suetsugu
will lose to some out-of-towner!

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:47.630 line:50 %
"Beware of Brush Fires"

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.790
He's goin' up against an Eight-Six, right?

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.150
That FD is a powerful machine,
but an Eight-Six is just so old!

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.100
At their request, we'll be
doing the downhill first.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.110
Rather than a simultaneous start,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.340
one driver will go first
with the other following.

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.440
They'll go in front on the first race.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:08.080
I think you realize that if we
lose the first race, it's over.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.950
It's good!

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.180
You can start at any time.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.360
It may be an Eight-Six, but don't
let your guard down, Tohru.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.330
That's definitely not an ordinary Eight-Six.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.670
I know.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.840
I don't care what kind of car the other guy has!

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.170
Right now, I'm gonna do
the best racing that I can!

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.810
Tohru!

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.970
Shinichi, hold your hand out.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.820
You get it, right?

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.490
I'm shaking.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.820
It's scary! The truth is, it's so
scary that I've got the jitters

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.060
and just wanna run away from here!

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.900
But at the same time, I'm happy.
I'm so happy I can't take it!

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.890
Do you know why?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.710
I'm grateful to Project D.
You can be a racer for a long time

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.210
and almost never get to race
with this kinda incredible tension.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:17.420
To me, today's race is the chance
of a lifetime to show my stuff!

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.920
As a representative of Seven Star Leaf,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.830
I'll make damn sure I run a
good race, with no regrets!

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.260
That's the spirit, Tohru.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.500
All right then, whaddya say
we get this thing started?!

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.580
Tohru Suetsugu. A pleasure.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.700
I'm Takumi Fujiwara.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:49.010
<i>Wh-What is this feeling?!</i>

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.520
<i>I've never felt this way before!</i>

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.090
<i>I'm stunned... I'm so shocked I can't stand it!</i>

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:10.300
<i>Protect me... Naho!</i>

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.940
<i>Tohru! I was so blown away by</i>
<i>Tohru's downhill corner entry</i>

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:49.180
<i>that I joined this team. He's a</i>
<i>do-or-die kamikaze downhiller!</i>

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.810
<i>There's not a person out there who</i>
<i>can keep up with Tohru's downhill!</i>

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.850
<i>There's no way he's gonna lose</i>
<i>to some out-of-town Eight-Six!</i>

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.100
<i>Going first was the right choice for me.</i>

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.330
<i>If your rhythm gets thrown off,</i>
<i>the downhill can be deadly!</i>

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.980
<i>Be relaxed... Rather than winning or losing,</i>

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.940
<i>what's most important is that</i>
<i>you give everything you've got.</i>

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:43.000
Compared to the Eight-Six,
the Roadster is even more compact,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.870
its small size and weight

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.840
allowing for the nimble footwork
that is its greatest weapon!

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.080
And the downhill of its
driver Tohru Suetsugu will,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.480
as I see it, bet everything
on high-speed corner entry.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.380
It is an unrefined style.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.150
Each and every corner will
be taken with an inertia drift.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.160
It is a driving style in which everything begins

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.330
when cornering speed has been
taken almost as high as it can.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.770
It could perhaps even be said
that his driving technique

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.200
was cultivated through the Roadster,
a car that lacks power.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.110
Meaning that he and Fujiwara...

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.840
Yes. His is much like the relationship

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.610
between Fujiwara and the Eight-Six.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.780
With just one exception.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.720
Whoa! Awesome!

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.690
The crux of this course is the
area that appears at the end,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.190
a continuous stretch where
the side ditches are uncovered.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.100
Victory will rest upon the
strategy executed in that area.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.700
About that, is there really
any action you can take

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.310
aside from just avoiding
those booby trap-like ditches?

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.970
There is.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.430
I've already informed Fujiwara.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.450
Without advanced load shift techniques,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.420
it would be dangerous to attempt...

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.290
...but Fujiwara and Keisuke can do it.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.960
For I have chosen them. They are...

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.120
...the twin aces of Project D!

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:32.000
Whoa, scary! Tohru's cornering
is as dangerous as ever!

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.240
Wh-What?!

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.410
Even so, that Eight-Six is keeping up with him!

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.780
That won't last long.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.450
There ain't a guy out there who
doesn't scare at Tohru's cornering!

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:50.120
I wonder how far that guy can
keep up with Tohru's crazy downhill.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.750
He definitely won't be able
to make it to the end!

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.470
<i>I expected as much.</i>
<i>Till now, no one has been able</i>

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.100
<i>to keep up with me this far.</i>

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.010
<i>That's no normal Eight-Six,</i>
<i>there's no mistake about that...</i>

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.940
<i>But more than that, the problem</i>
<i>is the guy behind the wheel.</i>

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.480
<i>He's incredible...</i>

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.940
<i>Still, I don't feel like he's gaining on me.</i>

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.790
<i>It's probably taking everything</i>
<i>he's got just to keep up.</i>

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.800
<i>I can win this race!</i>

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.240
<i>If you try too hard to keep up,</i>
<i>whatever happens is on you!</i>

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.640
<i>If you value your life, then pull out!</i>

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.910

<i>approach! Dangerously so!</i>
