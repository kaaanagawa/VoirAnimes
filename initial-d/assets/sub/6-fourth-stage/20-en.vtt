00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.660
Keisuke.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.330
This race must be handled
with the utmost precision.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.070
Okay? I need you to listen closely.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.520
This is advice I have not often given...

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.010
You're going first?

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.740
Yeah. Unlike Jo here,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.680
I'm not the type to lovingly
observe his opponent.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.250
I'm going for victory in the first race.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.220
My car's a bit heavy, so I don't
want to go drawing things out.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.190
We'll settle this nice and fast.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.000
Do as you like. But Ko,
at the risk of repeating myself,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.600
you have to control your bad
habit of slacking off mid-race.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.840
I don't think we'll lose,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.700
but these opponents don't seem
like they'll be easily beaten.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.110
Worrying too much is bad for your stomach.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.520
Leave this to me. I feel it
all too well... Their aura.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.390
This looks like it'll be hard.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.030
I don't know how well I can do,
but I'll just try it and see.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.030
The way you are now, you should be fine.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.700
According to your simulations,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.600
what's the margin limit I can concede
to him up till the turning point?

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.870
Indeed...

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.810
About seven seconds.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.780
Seven seconds, huh?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.080
Too much or too little and you will lose.
Don't forget that, Keisuke.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.810
Yeah.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.820
All right, shall we get started?!

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.350

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.820
Starting in five seconds!

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.190

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.980
Go!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.840
It's underway, eh? With Ko racing,
I'm sure there's no need to worry.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.210
He always comes through when it's needed.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.020
<i>Still, he can't let his guard down!</i>

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.510
<i>No slacking off. Just flee from</i>
<i>your opponent with all you've got!</i>

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.880
It looks like it's started.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.310
Yes...

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.250
His opponent is the God Foot,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.390
the man they say has a superhuman
mastery of accelerator handling,

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.490
Kozo Hoshino.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.720
I assume Keisuke is feeling
some pretty intense pressure.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.560
At any rate, this is no ordinary opponent.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.500
I've been unnerved since the
moment we first met him yesterday.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.200
We have an opponent of our own
to deal with: the God Arm.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.330
Let's give it our all and race
so that we have no regrets.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.950
Three... Two... One.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.210
Hyaaa!

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.130
<i>Well, well! For such a big-ass body,</i>

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.890
<i>you sure are showing me</i>
<i>some nimble movement.</i>

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.640
Yeah, yeah! This is feelin' great! Go!

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.790
It looks like it's already started, eh?

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.560
Huh? They're doing the uphill first today?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.760
No, that's not it.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.930
They're doing a combined stage,
uphill and downhill.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.600
A combined stage?

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.340
Yeah. One race, both hillclimb and downhill.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.930
They'll repeat that until the winner's decided.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.650
Speaking of Kozo Hoshino,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.780
my most lasting impression of him

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.650
is from when he was still driving an R32.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.520
I was at a going-away party,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.690
and Hoshino was at the last
corner of the Tsukuba circuit.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.530
I saw him drift the entire thing,
from entry to exit.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.090
I can still see it, like it's
burned onto my retinas.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.210
The GTR's ATTESA E-TS
4WD system is a bit unusual

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.810
and as a rule doesn't allow for drifting.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.780
That's because if the E-TS detects tailslide,

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.020
it simultaneously initiates front-wheel drive.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.150
Is that so? I don't know that much about 4WD.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.190
In other words, even if you reduce
countersteer and step fully on the gas,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.560
you can't maintain the slide angle
like in a normal rear-wheel drive.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.470
Front-side traction is increased,
and the car cancels out the drift.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.970
Also, because ATTESA E-TS
is designed to assign torque

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.080
to the front wheels automatically
according to acceleration,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.750
the more intricate your accelerator handling,

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.880
the more difficult it becomes to sustain drift.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.750
But you said his GT-R was drifting, right?

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:18.390
Drifting flawlessly.
Even Mr. Toudou was shocked by it.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.860
He said he had no explanation
for that kind of technique.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.700
Huh? Mr. Toudou said that?

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.000
Unthinkable, is it?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.910
Still, to Hoshino it was probably
a little game, just him showing off.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.780
I wonder if that's why Mr. Toudou
said we should come watch this race.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.090
Yeah. No doubt about it, Hoshino
has godlike mastery of pedal work.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.590
That's why they call him the God Foot.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.460
By the way, Mr. Toudou
also said something else...

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.600
That we should watch how Project D
faces the giant wall before them.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.730
What kind of race will this turn out to be?

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.200
I can't wait to find out.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.050
In the GT-R line alone,
I've gone through R32, 33 and 34...

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:20.580
Four cars already. The R32 had such
an impact on me when it debuted!

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.560
But when the bigger R33 came out,
talk about a disappointment.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.100
That one pretty much sucked! One, two...

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.900
Hyaa!

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:41.280
I got rid of that R33 right quick
and bought another R32...

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.740
...meaning that my fourth car
was this, the R34 GT-R!

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.820
All right.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.280
He's keepin' up with me, eh? Well done.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.190
<i>He's so damn fast!</i>

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.540
<i>I was full of confidence after having</i>
<i>upped my car's racing capabilities...</i>

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.480
<i>But I was naive.</i>

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.310
<i>Sure enough, when it comes to</i>
<i>traction, the GT-R is a monster!</i>

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.730
When you ride in Mr. Hoshino's
passenger seat, things sure get lively!

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.370
Yeah. For him, there's no
such thing as driving quietly.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.240
Sometimes, he does these
"Hyaa!" or "Hngrar!" sorts of yells.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.680
Yeah, yeah! That sure is surprising, huh?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.150
I guess talking like that is
how Mr. Hoshino concentrates.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.750
Muttering to himself and
going into his own world...

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.760
We regular guys could never
duplicate something like that.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.060
Yeah. If you're trying to concentrate,
staying quiet is the normal way to do it.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.260
<i>That's exactly it.</i>

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.370
<i>When people are absorbed in something,</i>
<i>normally they don't engage in idle chatter.</i>

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.240
<i>But I know the real reason...</i>

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.870
Hngrar!

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.010
Hyaa!

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:43.030
<i>Ko talks so that he doesn't</i>
<i>concentrate too much.</i>

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.130
<i>He's the type of guy who gets</i>
<i>more fired up than anyone!</i>

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.040
<i>Put simply, it's a cooling</i>
<i>system for his emotions.</i>

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.950
<i>This is the method he thought of so that</i>
<i>he wouldn't lose his cool or his objectivity.</i>

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.990
<i>I doubt it'll happen, but on</i>
<i>the off chance he stops talking...</i>

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.630
<i>...then like a drag machine with</i>
<i>its nitrous system engaged,</i>

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.560
<i>he will race wild and unchecked!</i>

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.460
Hyaaa!

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:28.810
<i>That's the one thing I want to avoid.</i>
<i>Be sure to play this smart!</i>

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.810
<i>According to our age.</i>

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.850
Certainly is muggy tonight, isn't it?

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.280
Oh, if you'd care for one of these...

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.990
--Here.
--Thank you.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.430
Are you all right? You're really sweating.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:53.130
I guess I'm the age where heat hits you most.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.350
This R34 really is a great car!

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:09.180
It even addresses the R32's one
weak point, stubborn understeer.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.790
It brakes well and it turns well.
There's no other car that's this fun!

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.230
If someone's got a bit of money
and doesn't know anything about cars,

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.990
he'll drive a Benz or a Ferrari or some crap.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.540
I've got money, but I couldn't care
less about those sorts of cars!

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.500
Till the day I die...

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.500
...give me a GT-R!

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.520
Hraa!

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.990
Graa!

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.910 line:50 %
"Touge Tunnel Project

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.910 line:50 %
To be implemented soon"

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:16.750
Still, you've never given Keisuke advice
the way that you did this time, have you?

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.190
Up till now, you've mostly let him act freely.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.960
That should be enough to tell you
our opponent this time is special.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.800
I know that, but...

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.230
Under these rules, managing tire performance

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.400
during the hillclimb will be key.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.540
Relying on traction against
an opponent in a 4WD GT-R

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.580
would likely cause rapid tire deterioration.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:46.620
But Keisuke has made dramatic progress
in his accelerator handling recently.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.320
That is my point. No matter how
much progress Keisuke has made,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.120
that skill will be of no use
against tonight's opponent.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.060
The man they call God Foot, eh?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.300
That's why I had him restrain
himself for the hillclimb

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.000
to wager the race on the downhill.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.400
Yes, I understand that, but still...

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.400
...isn't seven seconds a bit too dangerous?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.310
When I heard that off to the side,
I shivered in spite of myself.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.780
I would say the odds of winning
hinge upon seven seconds.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.350
What happens during those
seven seconds is most important.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:24.750
I am asking of Keisuke a race far
more difficult than any he has yet run.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.760
It is a tactic that acknowledges his
progress in accelerator handling...

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:36.460
And he probably understands my true intent.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.140
<i>I can't believe you'd tell me</i>
<i>something like that, brother.</i>

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.940
<i>Can we really take on a guy as fast as this</i>
<i>and give him a margin of seven seconds?</i>

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.850
<i>If I can't get that time back during</i>
<i>the downhill, it's game over!</i>

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.820
<i>Keeping a margin may be hard, but in</i>
<i>terms of execution, anyone can do it!</i>

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:12.870
<i>Still, my brother wouldn't bother saying</i>
<i>something that could be done that easily.</i>

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:16.570
<i>The problem is...</i>
<i>what those seven seconds hold!</i>

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.080
Not yet! No, not yet!

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:32.390
<i>My brother's probably asking</i>
<i>something incredibly difficult of me.</i>

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.260
<i>I have to focus my body and spirit...</i>

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.020
<i>...and concentrate on the</i>
<i>movement of my right foot.</i>

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.840
Hyaa!

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.020
--Yeah!
--Awesome! That's Hoshino for you!

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.720
He's slowly started to pull ahead of the FD!

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.260
Jeez, I guess even Project D's
hillclimb ace is no big deal.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.030
Idiot, Hoshino is just too awesome.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.760
There's no way an FD should be able to
keep up with an R34 on a course like this.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.720
At this rate, Purple Shadow will win
both the hillclimb and the downhill!

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:44.230
So that's your strategy, huh?
That's pretty clever of you.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.160
But you're still young...

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.600
If you ask me, there's no need
for you to be that clever just yet.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.170
At his age, I was more of an idiot,
always on the offensive.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.010
Well, it's because of that I've been
able to come this far without losing.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.650
One, two!

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:20.500
Project D's FD is slowly being left behind.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.770
How does this look to you, Sakai?
Will it all be over in the first race?

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:33.010
Not at all. It looks like this hillclimb
is using some nonstandard rules.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.540
Nonstandard rules?

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.610
The GT-R with its great traction
will have the uphill advantage,

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.880
but on the downhill, the lightweight FD
could have the upper hand.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.220
So he might hold back on the hillclimb,
not placing wear on his tires

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.960
until the downhill, which he'll bet the race on.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.360
I get it.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.400
Wait, so that means Project D is the one
that's actively trying to lay a trap?

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.840
But it's a big gamble, all or nothing.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.740
Trying this tactic on Kozo Hoshino
of all people will take some courage.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:09.680
If he doesn't follow as predicted
on the downhill, it's all over.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.750
Yeah.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:16.020
It's friggin' incredible how he
planned this... Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.020
The turnaround to the downhill
will be something to watch.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.860
Kozo Hoshino and Keisuke Takahashi

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.090
will engage in an all-out downhill race!

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:30.270
They're both probably well aware...
of where the importance of this race lies.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.200
Just thinking about it is making me tingle.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.010
<i>I'm prepared for the worst.</i>

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:47.280
<i>All I can do is have my right foot</i>
<i>do the best possible job it can!</i>

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.850
<i>If my brother says I can keep up</i>
<i>with him, I'll show them that I can!</i>

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.250
It won't be long.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:34.050
We've got word from down below. It looks
like Keisuke is slowly being left behind.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.100
Oh. Well, the GT-R has the
advantage on the hillclimb.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:46.470
This is probably a terrible feeling for Keisuke.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.410
I'm sure he hasn't experienced this before.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:56.440
His opponent's car, disappearing without
a trace from his FD's windshield...

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.630
Doing your best to control the frustration
at having your opponent disappear

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:16.700
while focusing all your concentration on the
tires' contact with the road is no easy task.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.670
You said it...

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.840
It's all right! Keisuke can do it!

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.610
<i>I have to concentrate...</i>

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:30.820
<i>Must keep horizontal gravity generated</i>
<i>from corner entry to exit steady.</i>

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.980
<i>I have to control the tires' load!</i>

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.800
<i>At the corner exit, I'll open it up</i>
<i>full-throttle and make a dash for it!</i>

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.500
Keisuke fought his way through
races in the Saitama area

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.040
with the aim of improving
his accelerator handling.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.110
As a result, he has seen vast improvement
in his management of tire performance.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.950
The rapidity with which he has absorbed
these techniques has surprised even me.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:42.020
That is what makes Keisuke Takahashi
an extraordinary driver.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.030
If this race becomes protracted,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.550
the results of that experience should manifest.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.040
There they are!

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.950
Yo, there they are!

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.120
It's Hoshino's GT-R!

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.320
He's running all by himself!
This isn't a race at all!

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:20.230
Hyaa!

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.230
Hngraa!

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.970
--Awesome!
--So cool!

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.510
Don't go lookin' down on my R34!

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.150
Go, Keisuke!

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.780
Hello? Kenta? How many seconds was it?

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.820
Understood. Thanks.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.870
Lag time at the turnaround
point was six seconds.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.530
I see.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.010
<i>Well done, I suppose.</i>

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.510
<i>He no doubt held back against</i>
<i>an opponent he couldn't see.</i>

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.920
<i>Because now the real gamble begins.</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
