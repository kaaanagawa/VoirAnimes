00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.040
One, two...!

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.470
What's this all about? Joshima and
Hoshino are coming? That's unusual.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.140
The biggest names of Purple
Shadow coming together...

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.040
I wonder what's going on.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.510
Don't you know? Project D is coming.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.580
Project D? So Joshima and
Hoshino plan to take them on?

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.490
No, no way. One of the younger members
of Purple Shadow will do it, right?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.060
There's no way either of them would
go out in a race. I mean, those two...

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.990
They're gods!

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.100
They're here! "God Arm"Toshiya Joshima
and "God Foot" Kozo Hoshino!

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.920
That stomach of yours is bulging again.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.360
You better lower your cholesterol
or you're not gonna live long.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.930
Leave me alone. "Fatten up,
then slim down," that's my motto.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.900
Also, I make it a point
not to listen to my doctor.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.100
That's a good one!

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.880
Project D, huh? It's been a while
since I've felt my blood race.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.450
This may be the folly of a couple
of middle-aged street racers,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.710
but I'm looking forward to it.

"Act 19: God Foot and God Arm"

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.100
Mr. Joshima, Mr. Hoshino,
do you really intend to participate?

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.230
In this upcoming race...

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.100
You bet. Something strange about that?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.640
No, not "strange," but...

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.070
Our opponents are basically kids,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.140
so there's no need for you,
our seniors, to participate.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.480
No, age has nothing to do with it.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.350
These folks are kind enough
to come here from Gunma,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.780
so responding in kind is just a matter
of common courtesy, don't you think?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.620
True, they're coming all the way here,
but it's not as if we asked them to...

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.660
C'mon, don't say that.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.030
In this case, just keep quiet
and let us do it our way.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.170
It's not as if we're vain enough to think
we're the absolute greatest there is.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.440
When Purple Shadow was first formed,
we taught you guys a lot of different things,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.540
but now, I don't think we could
even keep up with you youngsters.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.050
You must be joking, Mr. Hoshino!
We still don't even come close to you!

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.720
Come on, don't be so modest.
You've stood on the winner's podium

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.220
at the Tsukuba amateur circuit
race any number of times.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.230
We really like this sort of thing.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.560
Even at our age, it makes us feel like kids.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.700
Okay then, should we bang out
two or three more laps?

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.030
Yeah. Gotta shake off some
more of these cobwebs, huh?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.430
Honestly, what a joke. "Cobwebs," my foot.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.060
Those two are always polished
to razor-sharp precision.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.080
God Arm, so named for his
godlike handling capabilities...

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.200
Toshiya Joshima.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.050
And God Foot,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.790
named for his superhuman
ability to work the accelerator...

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.360
Kozo Hoshino.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.430
They've fought their way through
countless fierce battles...

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.860
They're the gods of the mountain pass!

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.320
Jeez...

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.890
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.090
This is Wataru.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.650
I'm in the area. You wanna
get something to eat?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.400
So? Where to next?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.570
Ibaraki.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.160
Ah.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.340
I...

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.180
I really am grateful to you. I feel like
you've given me an important hint.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.080
It makes me happy to hear that.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.790
Recently, I feel like I've finally
started to understand the Eight-Six.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.190
Huh?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.590
<i>There it is, the spacey side of him...</i>

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.700
We normal folk can't understand
what you say sometimes.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.300
But it's true! I've come to sort of understand it...

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.370
...how to race in order to bring out
the Eight-Six's full potential.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.940
What I should do when tackling
a course for the first time...

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.780
How to get the right
underbody balance point...

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:36.320
One by one, I've gradually come
to understand those things.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.550
Well, I guess that's what they call progress.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.190
Me, I don't see how you've been able to
race like this without knowing anything.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.230
I might lose someday...

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.630
But if that day comes, I think
by then I will have learned more.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.970
About the Eight-Six...

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.160
What's this all about? There's
one more support van this time.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.860
Ryosuke and I wrote up a list
of the things we'll need,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.570
and thought that three vans
wouldn't quite be enough.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.270
That's the kind of formidable
opponent we'll be facing.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.670
It's simplest just to think about it that way.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.280
We'll be traveling a long way
this time, so everyone drive safely.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.870
All right!

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.960
Let's head out!

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.400
Boss, did you hear?
Project D's next opponent...

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.030
...is Purple Shadow in Ibaraki.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.440
Huh.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.930
What's more, Kozo Hoshino and
Toshiya Joshima will face them.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.110
That's a surprise.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.320
If you two have time...

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.720
...you should go watch that race.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.590
Is Purple Shadow really that good?

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.490
Daiki, you may not know this,

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:29.230
but even Mr. Toudou acknowledges
Hoshino and Joshima as his betters.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.000
No way...

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.670
Sir, do you think Project D
has a chance of winning?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.510
Every race boils down to luck.
No one knows what'll happen.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.240
Rather than tryin' to
predict somethin' like that,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.450
you should think about how
<i>you</i> would take them on,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.520
then watch what Project D does to face
the giant wall that stands before them.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.990
It should be a good learnin' experience.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.760
Here they are!

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.960
Understood. We'll do our part to
make sure things run smoothly.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.200
Thank you very much.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.460
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.340
Huh. They're a nice bunch
of young men, very polite.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.010
Agreed.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.510
Their homepage is a bit confrontational,
so I thought they'd be cocky little brats.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.150
I like these guys.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:11:00.050
In return, I'll do them the courtesy
of giving this challenge my all.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.530
For the first time in a while...
this looks like it'll be a good night.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.530
As always, five laps at 80%.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.500
Be sure and concentrate.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.720
Incredible...

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:12.790
Van #4 is filled mostly with spare tires!

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:17.000
And one moped? What would we use this for?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.130
Well, that's for the drivers to use.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.470
The drivers?

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.670
I thought I'd have them scout the course
tomorrow evening while it's still light.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.140
Apparently, a moped makes
it easy to spot fractures

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.950
or small slopes in the road surface.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.620
That way, you can come up with strategies for
courses where the slightest variable counts.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.020
Walking the course is really the best way,

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.920
but this is what Ryosuke came up with,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.160
one of the new approaches
we'll be using from now on.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.000
I get it. Ryosuke sure does
think up a lot of ideas.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.160
I suppose this means if we stick
with the same approach as always,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.530
we won't be able to win...

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.650
Now it's okay!

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.880
I think this tire balance will
give you a good clean ride.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.280
Just be sure to keep a close eye on traction.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.620
Okay. Here I go.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.230
How is it, Matsumoto?

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.560
It's in great shape.
Fujiwara's in fine form as well, eh?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.640
Even the settings he requested make it
seem like he's got a handle on something.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.540
He's different from how he used to be.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.410
I feel that as well.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.210
There were times in the Saitama
area when he was quite conflicted.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.980
Even outside of D's activities, Fujiwara has
been practicing, in ways we haven't seen.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.320
He is definitely getting a handle on something.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.020
In this race, regardless of
whether he wins or loses,

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.020
he will experience sudden
explosive growth, Matsumoto.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.220
In any case, Keisuke's FD
sure has gotten flashy.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.630
For your information, the exterior
is 100% to Keisuke's taste.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.930
How is it?

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.970
The slopes are steeper than I'd thought,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.200
so this tire balance relies too much on the rear.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.300
Should we raise the back area a bit?

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.130
Please do.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.580
Are you Keisuke Takahashi, driver of the FD?

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.210
You're quite the looker.
I bet chicks dig you, huh?

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.490
I was a hit with the ladies
when I was younger, too.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.930
A guy like that's got an aura,
something you can instantly tell.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.770
Youth is somethin' you can't get back.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.140
Once I hit middle age, I got all this
activity around the belly here,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.810
and getting the young ladies
to turn 'round and look

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.480
takes so much effort it makes you wanna cry.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.510
And then there's the extra
money you've gotta spend!

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.650
Still...

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.690
When I score me some sweet
thing after all that effort,

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:31.990
I feel a kind of happiness I never
could've known in my younger days!

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.130
Anyway, one day you'll understand.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:39.670
You've gotta play the field while you're young.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.100
See ya.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.510
No, wait. I almost forgot
what I really wanted to say.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.180
I've got an important proposal
to make about tomorrow's race.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.350
Proposal? What is it?

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.450
How should I put this...?

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.450
Normally, a mountain pass
has an uphill and a downhill.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.020
In my case, I haven't tuned my car
thinking only about the uphill...

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.160
Aiming for total balance is
the mark of a true racer, right?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.000
That's where my proposal
comes in. For just our race,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.630
what do you say we opt
against an uphill-only stage?

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.410
You mean, race on a stage that
combines uphill and downhill?

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.840
That's what I mean.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.140
<i>If that's how this is going to be,</i>

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.710
<i>I'd like to show off some of</i>
<i>my killer downhill techniques.</i>

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:33.050
Okay. I accept your proposal. With pleasure.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.490
Yes! I appreciate that.
I look forward to our race.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.830
Oh, and one more thing.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.900
Can we do our race first?

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.930
Before the downhill?

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.500
I get more fired up that way.
I'm the impatient type.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.270
Waitin' just drives me crazy.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.240
Fine. That's okay as well.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.540
Okay! Well, that's that,
and I'm lookin' forward to it!

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.410
See ya!

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.020
Was that a bad move, brother?

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.360
I didn't think I had any reason to refuse.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.400
It's fine. It was an unexpected
proposal, but sure enough,

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.730
there was no reason to refuse...

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:25.870
Rather than being disadvantageous,
his proposal in fact counts in our favor.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:32.150
I take my hat off to him. He casually
made us a most fair proposition.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.950
He is a formidable opponent, Keisuke.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.500
<i>I feel like... sort of invigorated.</i>
<i>It's been a while since I've felt this!</i>

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.140
<i>Like I could lose...</i>

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.830
<i>That old dude is something else!</i>

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:06.080
<i>What is this? I feel so much</i>
<i>pressure. Far more than usual!</i>

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.750
<i>This will be one incredible race!</i>

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.130
Man, I'm tired!

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.000
You said it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.470
Keisuke, Fujiwara.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.680
You two will be staying

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.050
at a bed-and-breakfast
at the foot of the mountain.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.210
A bed-and-breakfast?

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.980
Yes. You can get a good night's
rest in an air-conditioned room.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.720
That's fine and all, but why just us?

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.960
It should be obvious.
Because you're the drivers.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.490
No way! I'm fine without!

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.630
I'll sleep in my car as always.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.000
Ryosuke, please take the room in my place.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.640
No, Fujiwara. This is my order as team leader.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:06.740
We are in that season. With days as hot
as these, one can hardly sleep inside a car.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.140
It's important you be rested to
preserve your powers of concentration

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.380
for tomorrow's race.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.380
Getting a good night's rest
is for the sake of the team!

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.880
I'll take you to the bed-and-breakfast,
so grab your things and get into Van #1.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.230
Fumihiro said he'll come get us around 4:00.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.030
We'll be able to get quite
a bit of sleep, won't we?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.070
I feel bad for the others,

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.240
but I sure am grateful to be able to
stretch my legs and sleep like this.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:49.520
You said it. This is the first time, isn't it?
Since we've started D's expeditions.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.250
Still, this course will make it
hard to go on the offensive.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.060
It's pretty short, but it has some
points that're hard to nail down.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.460
There are lots of corners with lazy turns
and no visible exit point, aren't there?

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:08.630
The roads have lots of twists... It doesn't
seem like a race that'll be settled soon.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.080
<i>That was fast! The idiot's already asleep!</i>

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.910
<i>Does he not feel pressure or anything?</i>

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.950
<i>He looks like a pushover, but he's</i>
<i>got an irritatingly tough core.</i>

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.150
<i>I'm way more sensitive...</i>

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.460
What is that boy Kenta doing?

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.230
He said he put some tanning oil on
and was going to get some sun.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.910
Idiot. What does he want to get any darker for?

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.240
Anyway, these days sure have gotten hot.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.940
Being inside our cars
would be unbearable, huh?

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.450
It was a good call, having Keisuke
and Fujiwara rest someplace cool.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:02.760
That's right. This race will require
peak physical and mental strength.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.630
He even thought this part through.
That's Ryosuke for you.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.000
Yes, indeed...

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.150
Fujiwara sure is taking his
sweet time inspecting the course.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.350
He doesn't seem to be coming back, does he?

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.050
Keisuke breezed through it
and was back in about 15 minutes.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.650
It's not a competition, you know.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.330
I've got my own pace. I may be fast,
but I saw what I needed to see.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.000
Well, do your best. You'll be racing first today.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.730
Just leave it to me!

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.760
I slept nice and cool,
and my body's in top form!

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.570
It's about to start. Tonight is a big event!

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.580
Just having Joshima and Hoshino participate

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.550
in this kind of event makes it big enough!

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.480
Those guys are legends in their own time!

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.120
Seriously, what do you think about Project D?

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.120
Can their drivers compete with the
duo that people refer to as gods?!

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.090
They're no ordinary racers, that's for sure.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.060
Both of them are young guys still in their 20s,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.470
but they've been to all the
mountain passes in northern Kanto

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.300
and have never lost once.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.910
Then they'd better give it their all.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.100
After all, we came here to watch the gods race!

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.810
There sure are a lot of onlookers.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.180
Yeah. Having too many people
here would just cause problems,

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.190
so apparently D didn't advertise the time
and place on their homepage this time.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.930
Still, there are fansites out there
that posted the info themselves.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:59.030
Oh, really? It sure is rough.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.020
Being famous.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.280
My arms are twitching... I can't wait
another second to get out there.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.310
Now Ko, you control your bad
habit of letting your guard down

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.880
and not staying alert.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.820
Don't you worry. I've got a reputation
to uphold in Purple Shadow.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.650
I won't lose to some youngster.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.560
I'll show him the techniques
of a middle-aged pro!

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.530
We'll start with the hillclimb.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.330
Once you've reached the top,
there will be a pylon.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:36.000
Without stopping, turn around and come
back down. That will count as one race.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.300
Is that acceptable?

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.740
Yeah, sure. It's a combined stage
with an uphill and a downhill.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.980
For the first race, I'd like to lead.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.740
Understood.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.330
All right. Shall we begin?

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.240
Let's state our names again. I'm Kozo Hoshino.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.910
Keisuke Takahashi.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.460
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:16.600
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.490
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.440
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
