00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.520
The C-21 hairpin?!

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.490
They're already that far?

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.490
What does this mean?
They're running tail to nose.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.760
They've gone almost halfway and
the Eight-Six is still on Tohru's tail.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.530
I can't believe it, Atsuro!

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.770
There's no way anyone could
keep up with Tohru this long!

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.170
I don't want to believe it either.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.940
For the Eight-Six to be this fast...

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.880
I've got a bad feeling.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.220
Tohru hates to lose, so he'll dig in his heels
and get more and more worked up.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.090
This downhill is gonna get dangerous.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.020

"Act 2: Full Throttle! Downhill Battle"

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.420
In the underpowered FR,
he is a downhill specialist.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.620
To be sure, he has several points
in common with Fujiwara.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.390
They both have an instinctive sense for speed,
and have mastered cornering at high speeds.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.440
Perhaps what decisively
separates the two will be

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440
the degree to which they've
refined their technique.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.810
Meaning the fact that Fujiwara is
coming from behind on the first race...

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.180
...will be of great importance
in determining victory or defeat.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.820
What do you mean, Ryosuke?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.350
Fujiwara has been observing his
opponent's racing from behind,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.260
and should have begun to
understand it on a sensory level.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.670
<i>I feel like I've sort of got it now.</i>

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.770
<i>By looking at him from behind...</i>

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.610
<i>...I see the difference in how he and I race.</i>

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.690
They're here! There they are!

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.710
Did you see that just now?!
They're both awesome!

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.680
They were only like this far away from the wall!

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.990
Those are some crazy sons of bitches!

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.590
You spend too much money on your car.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.370
If you're going to say it
like that, I'll lend it to you.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.700
But...

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.540
...on one condition.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.180
Condition?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.850
If you lose this next race,
you have to give up racing!

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.250
I mean it this time.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.880
If you don't keep your promise,
I'll break up with you for real.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.380
<i>I ain't gonna lose!</i>

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.880
<i>H-He's right up on me!</i>

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.890
<i>Why?! This is me driving here!</i>

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.960
<i>I'm the best racer there is.</i>

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.990
<i>What the hell's going on?!</i>

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.410
<i>This Eight-Six...</i>

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.580
<i>What the hell is this guy?</i>

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.190
Tohru can't shake the Eight-Six?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.820
Wh-What the heck's going on?!
I just don't get it!

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.630
Tohru's greatest weapon,
learned from a long time of racing,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.300
is the unbeatable speed of his corner entry.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.810
No one should be able to match that cornering!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.210
His opponent knows all the
corners here inside and out.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.480
It's way beyond having run it just one night.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.450
And yet, not only has the
Eight-Six not been shaken off...

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.440
...it's actually keeping up!

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.000
<i>What incredible corner entry!</i>

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.700
<i>He knows every inch of this course!</i>

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.730
<i>But...</i>

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.410
<i>In the time between recovering from corners</i>

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.040
<i>and entering the next braking,</i>
<i>the Eight-Sixis faster.</i>

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.590
<i>Why? It's not a difference in automotive power.</i>

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.060
On a mountain road of complex terrain,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.400
there are more corners
than can even be counted.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.430
In particular, in a downhill race,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.900
there are far more "partial" areas
that are neither straights nor curves

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.570
than one would expect.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.040
To be sure, there are lots of places
where you'd waver between

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.340
going in at full- or half-throttle.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.910
The ability to adapt to those sorts of areas

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.250
will be the difference between the
racing of Fujiwara and his opponent.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.120
Remember that, Keisuke.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.220
In the theory of high-speed
public racing that I espouse,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.960
this is a most important point.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.450
Okay.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.730
<i>Shit! You think I'm gonna lose?!</i>

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.720
That's crazy dangerous! I'm, like, shaking!

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.060
I've never seen such awesome
corner entry before!!

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.090
To be able to keep up with
Seven Star Leaf's Roadster...

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.760
Who the heck is in that Eight-Six?!

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.900
He ain't even a local...
This is friggin' incredible!

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.890
Project D's got crazy mad talent!

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.650
It won't be long now. They're approaching
the point that will decide this race.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.950
Yeah.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.590
Say, Ryosuke, don't leave me hanging. Tell me!

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.920
What kind of plan is it? The strategy
for the uncovered drainage ditches.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.300
Looks like Tohru's still bein' followed.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.170
They've already passed C-10.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.500
C-10?!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.280
This guy's a lot better than we'd thought.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:21.950
But Atsuro, even if Tohru can't shake
him off, that doesn't mean he'll lose!

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.850
They'll just change positions
and go into the second race.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:32.360
The real battle's still to come, right?
There's no way Tohru could be overtaken!

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.970
You're right. This whole
overtaking thing is unthinkable.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.040
The area up ahead is gonna be just impossible.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.900
That's right!

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.740
<i>Even if you can't get rid of him,</i>
<i>there's nothin' to worry about, Tohru.</i>

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.740
<i>Go into to the next race and don't lose!</i>

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.730
Very well, I shall explain.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.740
The strategy for the uncovered ditch
area that I explained to Fujiwara...

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.040
Yeah?

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.910
Fujiwara had already acquired
a specialty technique, correct?

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.380
You mean putting his tire into
the drain? The "drain drop" thing?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.910
Correct.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.880
So you're gonna use that?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.690
Unthinkable. It would not be
applicable with this type of ditch.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.790
Even you should recognize that.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.530
The strategy is to use the exact
opposite of that technique.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.430
The exact opposite...

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.960
<i>He's an unbelievable driver! I can't shake him!</i>

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.480
<i>I really want to look at his</i>
<i>driving from behind! His driving...</i>

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.640
<i>Just what kind of driving is it?!</i>

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.480
<i>How is he tackling my home course?</i>

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480
<i>How's it different from mine?</i>

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.450
<i>No matter what, I'm goin' into the second race!</i>

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.230
<i>I wanna see this guy's technique!</i>

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.070
<i>His cut-in timing is a little early!</i>

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.430
<i>I've seen the line!</i>

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.180
Bastard! You're just gonna
ignore that uncovered ditch?!

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.130
<i>He's pulled forward! He's gonna</i>
<i>go in on the next right, huh?</i>

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.290
<i>Shit! I won't let you!</i>

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.970
<i>Even if I'm just half-way in front,</i>

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.640
<i>the road is still mine!</i>

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.660
<i>I won't give you any space!</i>

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.710
<i>I've got local pride, dammit!</i>

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.700
<i>I won't let you pass!</i>

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.830
<i>What?!</i>

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.400
<i>Idiot! There's not enough</i>
<i>room for you to get by!</i>

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.230
<i>There shouldn't even be any road there!</i>

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.100
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.060
<i>You... Where the hell are you driving?!</i>

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.110
I told you it would require
load shift techniques.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:18.550
Cornering at maximum speed places the
majority of load on the two outside tires.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:24.060
Accelerating at that point causes
increased load shift to the rear.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.230
So both outer-side loads
are borne only by the rear?

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.940
Correct. In other words, the driver
intentionally creates a strong load shift

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.370
and reduces as much load as
possible from the inner-side front.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.430
If you can do that...

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:49.880
...then at full throttle, you can
shortcut directly above the ditch.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.730
<i>He passed me! Am... Am I dreaming?</i>

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.220
<i>What was that just now? What happened?!</i>

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.500
<i>Try that again at the next right!</i>

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500
<i>What the hell just happened?!</i>

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.060
<i>Show me that again so I can see!</i>

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.450
<i>Dammit! If an Eight-Six can do it, so can this!</i>

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.600
<i>I don't feel my right front</i>
<i>tire gripping the ground!</i>

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.760
<i>Is it in the air?</i>

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.660
<i>I'm gonna fall!</i>

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.980
<i>It's no good! I can't get back up!</i>

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.990
--He wiped out!
--You okay?!

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.420
This is bad...

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.330
Are you all right?

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.870
You're not hurt?

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.420
A crash at C-7?

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:09.790
Was it Tohru?!

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.420
Any injuries?

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.130
I see.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:34.720
The Roadster was overtaken by the
Eight-Six and crashed. It can't race.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.580
You win.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.890
What's going on?

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.920
What the heck is going on?!

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.840
At first glance I thought it was an R34 GT-R...

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.280
I do like those FR GT turbos.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.580
That's a nice hobby right there.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.320
<i>Take a good look at the true</i>
<i>power of an ace driver.</i>

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.010
Fujiwara!

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:21.660
I'm Atsuro Kawai.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.760
I'm Keisuke Takahashi.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.970
<i>He doesn't intimidate his</i>
<i>opponent, but at the same time</i>

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.180
<i>he doesn't seem to be</i>
<i>putting on any airs at all.</i>

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.950
<i>This is our home course, and he shouldn't</i>
<i>know anything about what I'm capable of...</i>

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.470
<i>So how can he be so calm?</i>

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.950
<i>Just what is this?</i>

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.790
<i>This unknown feeling of intimidation?</i>

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.150
Atsuro...

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:19.990
I'm shocked, Tohru. Even before we've started,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.390
I feel like I've been made
to walk to their rhythm.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.590
Don't think about it! Just keep your own pace.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:28.560
I couldn't, which is why that happened to me.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.100
Yeah...

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.870
Also, let me give you one piece of advice.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:38.240
In the area starting around C-6, where
the drainage ditches are uncovered...

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.770
Be sure not to open any room on the in-side,
and stay right on the corner line!

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.910
If you open up more than a meter,
he's sure to go past you.

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.250
These bastards will shortcut
right over the ditch.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.250
What are you talkin' about, Tohru?
That's ridiculous.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.560
These guys can do it!
Believe what I'm telling you!

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.720
Do <i>not</i> open up any space on the in-side!

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.060
Very well, let's begin.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.600
Don't let him pass you, Atsuro.
I'm counting on you!

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.560
<i>Atsuro... These are some</i>
<i>incredible drivers we're up against.</i>

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.930
<i>They let me know just how</i>
<i>big a gap there is between us.</i>

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:36.890
<i>You might not even have a chance of winning,</i>
<i>but at least make it through the first race!</i>

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.610
<i>These Project D guys are incredible!</i>

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.950
<i>It's like they have an aura!</i>

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.110
Welco--!

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.990
Hey there, Kenji.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.490
What the hell kind of face is that?

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:38.360
Well, it's not like you're gonna
get any high-octane or anything...

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:44.070
Hey now! Anyway, I've got some news.
Project D has won again.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.470
Really?! Where this time?

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:47.800
In Tochigi.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.570
How did Takumi do?

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:53.370
He won, of course! And he
set a new course record.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.410
Looks like they won both
the uphill and downhill!

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:00.850
Bit by bit, Takumi's moving up the ranks, huh?

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.250
As opposed to...

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.820
Meaning we're no different from
ever, eh? Come on, don't say that.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.760
What? You're going to quit racing?

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.230
That was the deal, wasn't it?
I lost last night's race.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.780
What's wrong, Tohru?! Did you hit
your head in yesterday's wreck?

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.410
I don't like this. Get a hold of yourself!

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:33.350
What are you talkin' about?

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.720
You're the one who said
I had to quit racing if I lost!

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:44.960
I know, but... I just said it trying to
be mean, because I was frustrated.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.970
It's all right. It's actually a relief I lost. Really.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.410
Up till now, I thought that as a local,
I could never lose to any out-of-towner

00:22:57.410 --> 00:23:02.540
and that I raced faster than anyone.
I had total confidence in myself.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:09.050
But I lost outright to some guy from another
pass, who'd only practiced for one night.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.490
Sure it was a shock,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.790
but it feels good that when I got
beaten, it was done so perfectly.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.590
Tohru...

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.630
Don't make that face, Naho.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.330
I'm not sayin' I'm never
gonna drive a car again.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.400
Simply toeing the line isn't
how a racer does things, right?

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:33.310
I'm just gonna have a different relation
with cars than I have had up till now.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.820
It really was the best night.
I've never been that stoked.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:44.650
I think it was great that
I got to meet those guys.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:55.760
It's like any profession... There are
very few who ever make it to the top.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.870
Those guys are probably among the select few.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.470
But I know now that I'm not.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.670
Project D... They really are awesome dudes.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:53.390
Project D? Oh, that team from Gunma
that people are talking about recently.

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.560
They're coming? Hm.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.860
What are you doing on the weekend, Tomo?
There are no races this week, right?

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.200
No races, but I'm busy with tests.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.200
Hey, you're not trying to
drag me into this, are you?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.740
Of course not.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.780
There's no need to worry.
I definitely won't lose.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.410
I swear it on the name of the Toudou School!

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740
