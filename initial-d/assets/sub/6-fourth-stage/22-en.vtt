respond to my more delicate handling.

it out with the steering wheel!

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.650
Should we three guys be spending it
lollygagging in a place like this?

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.650
No, we shouldn't! But what's the alternative?!

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.860
No need for you to get upset, is there?

No, we don't.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:48.680
Okay, I'm counting on you.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.240

position for the first race.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.030

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.070
Uh, please do.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.110
I'd like to know why someone
your age decided on an Eight-Six.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.950
I'm extremely curious to hear the reason.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:31.460
Well, it's not as if I actually chose this car...
It was originally my father's.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.720
Your father's?

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.820
Yes.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.460
It's been at our house since I was a kid.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.660
This was all we had, so it's
the only car I ever drove.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.000
I'm attached to it, and drove it a lot
illegally before I got my license.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.940
Interesting.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.140
So, your father taught you driving
techniques before you had your license?

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.670
Yeah... That's about how it worked.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.820
I'd like to meet your father. I have
a feeling we could be friends.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.290
You'll allow me to do my
best as your opponent.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.960
By all means.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.480
Ryosuke, we can start anytime.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.150
I see.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.860
--Listen closely, Fujiwara.
--Okay.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:47.800
I'll be clear. This is the fiercest opponent
you've yet faced. He has no weaknesses.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.890
At present, there is only one
piece of advice I can give:

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.540
Endure.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.910
Even if you can't win, you should be able
to make it so that you aren't beaten.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:03.050
I will give you additional
advice when the time is right.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.320
As much as possible, look at the
course and not the other driver.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.510
He is a ghost.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.820
Don't forget.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.360
Begin it, Fumihiro.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.830
Okay.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.070
All right, beginning the countdown!

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.540
Five! Four! Three!

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.010
--Two! One!
--Ghost?

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.600
Go!

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.890
Got it.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.890
The first downhill race has started.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.270
<i>I'm counting on you, Jo.</i>

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.100
<i>By the honor of the man they call the God Arm,</i>

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.440
<i>please make this a one-win, one-loss draw.</i>

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.410
Keisuke.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.240
Do you think Fujiwara will be all right?

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.720
Worryin' about it won't
change anything, will it?

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.090
This is his race now.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.410
According to Mr. Toudou,

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.610
this guy Toshiya Joshima has settled
into a particular sort of technique.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.150
Call it a habit or whatever,

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:49.750
but he'll keep his left hand on the
gearshift and steer only with the right.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.630
What kind of merit would that have?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.090
Me, I've gotta use both hands
to steer or it doesn't feel right.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.270
Wait a minute. Steering with just one hand...

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:12.040
Wouldn't there be corners where there's
not enough steering angle to turn?

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.010
Actually, aren't most corners
on a mountain pass like that?!

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.280
That's why Toshiya Joshima,
the sorcerer of steering,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.720
is called the God Arm.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.290
<i>He's fast! Unbelievably so!</i>

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.630
<i>As I thought, he's quite good.</i>

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.180
Oh. It's probably drift.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.240
It would take incredibly high skill,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.210
but if he used a zero-counter drift from
the minimum possible steering angle...

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:54.550
That's not it. Toshiya Joshima does not drift.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.090
It's not drift and it's not grip...

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.160
Apparently, his racing
is something in-between.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.260
Huh? In-between drift and grip?
So it's neither of the two?

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.890 line:50 %
"Steep Curve"

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.100
Everyone seems to think Jo's one-handed
steer is some off-the-wall technique,

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.210
but it's grounded in solid principles.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.410
What it boils down to is, how do you
turn along a slight steering angle?

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.040
Jo has spent more than 20 years
pursuin' that question.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.470
He's combined various techniques,
and after all that trial and error,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.300
he got to where he is now.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:53.770
He'll emphatically say it's not drift
and it's not grip, but if ya ask me...

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.210
...it's the perfect drift.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.980
The really high-level techniques
are the ones that're hard to see,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.990
and just look sort of plain.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.160
Tires do their best work

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.630
when the G-forces kick in and you're
not sure if they'll grip or slide out.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.000
Yeah...

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.630
I think he makes his car slide just
enough that you can't tell by looking.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.040
From a logical standpoint,
that sort of makes sense.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:00.030
I get it. So that's what it means
to be in between drift and grip?

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.150
Mr. Toudou knows full well.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.650
The Toudou School and Purple Shadow
have been rivals for many years.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.220
Back when we were active in the scene,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.790
we used to have racing meets
all the time on the circuits.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.630
To think that the top members of Purple
Shadow would actually do a street race...

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:24.000
If we'd let this chance slip by us,
we'd never get a second one.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.730
The God Foot Kozo Hoshino...

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.710
...and the God Arm Toshiya Joshima are two
men whose racing we should watch closely,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.700
I'd say this means.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.920
Fumihiro, do you remember
Shingo Shoji of the Night Kids,

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.920
whose specialty was the
duct tape death match?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.560
Shoji... Oh, I think he was the guy

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.190
who'd fasten his right hand to
the steering wheel with duct tape.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.840
This would let him turn only within
a set range of steering angles.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.710
In other words, his turns had to
rely on accelerator handling.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.410
It could be that Toshiya Joshima's
single-handed steer

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.870
is an extension of that technique...

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.090
Or rather, its ultimate,
most thoroughly perfected form.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.060
But why bother? Aside from having his
left hand able to perform all shifting,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.200
what's the benefit?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.800
The answer to that is in the realm of
sensitivity unique to Toshiya Joshima.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.710
While undoubtedly an
unorthodox driving style,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:41.080
some of the WRC's top drivers
have utilized a single-handed steer.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.950
<i>It's exactly the same! This feeling...</i>

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.220
<i>A pressure, a kind of</i>
<i>overwhelming tingling sensation.</i>

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.430
<i>It's just like that of a certain bastard</i>
<i>of an old man who drives an Impreza...</i>

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.790
<i>It's so alike it makes me sick!</i>

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.690 line:50 %
"Touge Tunnel Project

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.690 line:50 %
To be implemented soon"

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.920
What I think about how it's going?

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.120
Yes.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.430
That's neither here nor there.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:32.000
This won't be a race that'll be
decided in one or two rounds.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.430
Oh, really?

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:39.470
The course itself isn't that long, and
there aren't many proper straightaways.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:43.540
It's going to have to be
something of a drawn-out race.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.540
But if...

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.980
If there's anything that could
decide this race quickly...

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.820
It would be Fujiwara losing.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.720
Put another way, unless he digs in for the
long haul, he'll have no chance of winning.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.130
That's the kind of race
you should think of this as.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.730
The key will be the second round,
when the opponent goes first.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.370
If Fujiwara can hang in there,
tough it out somehow...

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.530
This will become one
tangled marathon of a race.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:21.810
Anyone with a bit of knowledge
would think that about the first round.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:24.510
No matter how heated things
look like they're getting,

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.680
they're still just trading light jabs.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.940
--Awesome!
--So fast!

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:50.240
They're both fast! Joshima of Purple
Shadow and Project D's Eight-Six!

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.040
I've never seen such fast cornering before!

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.540
It's awesome... An all-out downhill battle!

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.420
<i>The first round will be over soon.</i>

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.750
<i>Dammit! He did nothing but pressure me,</i>
<i>and I couldn't do anything!</i>

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.690
<i>This first round went as planned,</i>
<i>with me getting a good, long look at you.</i>

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.360
There they are.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.970
They're right on top of each other!
There's no gap at all!

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.660
Beginning the countdown!

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.890
Five... Four... Three...

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.830
Two... One...

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.460
Go!

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.510
It looks like the second round's begun.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.100
Yeah.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:08.750
<i>This second round is the critical stage, huh?</i>
<i>And we're following this time.</i>

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:14.420
<i>Fujiwara's tenacity when coming</i>
<i>from behind really is second-to-none...</i>

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.830
<i>He hasn't lost once from behind,</i>
<i>no matter who he's faced.</i>

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.370
<i>Still, Keisuke said "if"</i>
<i>Fujiwara can hang in there.</i>

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.830
<i>Meaning, he must be facing</i>
<i>an incredible opponent!</i>

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.900
The S2000 really is a difficult car to master,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.900
but its racing capabilities are second-to-none.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.500
Mr. Toudou says it's even faster
at cornering than an NSX.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.980
Having a driver like Toshiya
Joshima behind the wheel

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.250
means there's no way it
could lose to an Eight-Six.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.480
Yeah, I wonder...

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:17.490
Maybe he won't even have to do anything
special, just draw out the car's potential,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.030
and that will be enough to catapult it into
a zone where the Eight-Six can't keep up.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.400
I'd like to believe that's how
the second round will be.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.400
But what's "normal" in a situation
like this isn't normal at all...

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.940
Because both drivers are
anything but ordinary.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.210
Especially the driver of that Eight-Six, huh?

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.780
He has a genius-like ability you'd
have to race him to understand.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:48.590
What's more, it's perfectly suited
for that car, the Eight-Six.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.520
In a sense... he was born for the
purpose of becoming that car's driver!

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.570
Its engine is not just an NA,

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:08.100
it is an F20 capable of
producing 125 hp per liter.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:12.740
The F20 is a VTEC unit that boasts enough
power output to put racing engines to shame

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.980
and most assuredly poses a
threat to Fujiwara. However,

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.720
the S2000's true value lies
in its handling capabilities.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.390
Its mid-front mounted engine

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.120
achieves optimal 50:50
front-to-rear weight distribution,

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.330
and its rigid High X-Bone Frame is such that

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.070
one forgets the car's open-body structure.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:40.640
In addition to its compact and lightweight
in-wheel, double wishbone suspension,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.910
it boasts heightened racing
capabilities exhaustively refined

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:50.950
through traditional means rather than
a modern electronic control system,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:56.350
such that it can even beat high-tech cars
fitted with turbochargers or 4WD.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.190
However, as a car, it is limited to
the smallest percentage of drivers.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:09.100
In other words, you have to be extremely
talented in order to make full use of it?

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.770
Experiencing the "limited domain"
that is the S2000 is, one could say,

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:18.380
the privilege of a handful of
drivers blessed with great skill.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.510
And "God Arm"Toshiya
Joshima is one such driver.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.510
Fujiwara's gone head-to-head with
a really troublesome opponent...

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.180
I'm pretty interested in this second round.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.150
We'll get the general idea of what
kind of script Jo's thought up for this.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.090
You say "script," but...

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:10.390
Mr. Joshima is in front, so why not just
lose his opponent and be done with it?

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:15.530
Nah. You wouldn't think it,
but he's actually a bit perverse.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:21.560
The more talented his opponent, the more
that little devil of his comes out.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.410
If Jo put his mind to it
and went on the offensive,

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.680
I bet he could outdistance <i>any</i> opponent.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.620
Whatever else, he knows
this course inside and out.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.680
Not even a pro racer could
beat us in that respect.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.930
<i>This is tough. I'm trying my hardest,</i>
<i>but he's still a good distance ahead.</i>

00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:00.780
I'll say this for the sake of Jo's reputation.
If there's no winner in this second round,

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.980
I think the script he's planned
is to win not when he's leading,

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:06.820
but when he's following.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.990
What?! Even for Mr. Joshima,
that would be impossible!

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.220
This course has no straight
angles and is all corners,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.660
so overtaking someone would be...

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.230
Nah, I bet that's probably
what he intends to do.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.220
'Cause he's perverse.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.520
<i>I didn't notice when I was in front...</i>

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.820
<i>...but his lines are different!</i>

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:57.670
<i>There are points where his line</i>
<i>doesn't match what I'd thought best.</i>

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.040
<i>His timing when he reaches</i>
<i>the in-line is earlier or later...</i>

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.210
<i>It's different from normal theory!</i>

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.110
<i>But here, is his way the right choice?</i>

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:10.980
<i>If not... I can't explain this speed!</i>

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:29.470
<i>Ryosuke... What you told</i>
<i>Fujiwara is really bothering me.</i>

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.500
As much as possible, look at the
course and not the other driver.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.700
Your opponent is a ghost.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.080
<i>Fujiwara's greatest weapon is his</i>
<i>ability to be behind an opponent</i>

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.920
<i>and "absorb" his speed, so why...?</i>

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.150
<i>And what did he mean by "ghost"?</i>

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.770
<i>I don't get it. How can he be</i>
<i>so fast using a line like that?</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>Senjou ni saita rose,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>
