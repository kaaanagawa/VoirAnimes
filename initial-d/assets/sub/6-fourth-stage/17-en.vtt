<i>Come with me, come and cry with me</i>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.970
<i>Got to be, got to be,</i>

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.570
<i>Noizy Tribe, you're my Noizy Tribe</i>

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.310
<i>You can feel, you can feel,</i>
<i>you can feel in my love (C'mon!)</i>

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.810
<i>Come with me, come and cry with me</i>

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.580
<i>Got to be, got to be,</i>
<i>now you got to be free (Yeah!)</i>

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.120
<i>Noizy Tribe, you're my Noizy Tribe</i>

<i>You can break, you can break,</i>
<i>you can break 'cause you're Noizy Tribe</i>

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.110
<i>Here come the Noizy Tribe, we're back!</i>

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.360
<i>This is just between us...</i>

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.030
<i>But all you guys are sorta in trouble.</i>

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.570
That guy that lost the race
just now has sort of flipped out.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.710
He's called up a bunch of his friends,
really bad characters.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.880
So, in other words...

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.180
You're telling me to lose on purpose?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.220
Nah, I didn't say that.
All I said was not to race too hard.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.160
I'm sayin' this to be kind.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.150
<i>Think about it.</i>

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.500
They're close now. They're just up ahead.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.070
The approach to this point is one
of this course's difficult areas, huh?

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.870
You've gotta maintain speed,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.780
coming downhill at a slow turn
and then making a sudden left.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.280
There's no way to make any
kind of direct braking path.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.760
How the "best downhiller in Gunma"
tackles it will be something to watch for.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.420
What's more, he's in an Eight-Six with no ABS.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.740
This is bad! The Eight-Six's
braking point is too late!

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.300
I've never seen anyone go chargin'
in full-throttle that far before!

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.550
Awesome! He caught right up to him!

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.220
<i>Shit!</i>

"Act 17: The Saitama Area's Final Battle"

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.840
Okay. Understood.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.580
It seems Fujiwara's braking technique
is surprising the onlookers.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.180
Well, of course.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.790
He's practiced over and over, learning to
choose the last possible braking point.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.960
It's a piece of cake for him now.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.690
The Eight-Six has been tuned not
for flat terrain but for the downhill,

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.700
wherein braking is executed with the
front section pointing slightly downward.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.270
Utilizing the Eight-Six's light weight,
and dependent upon the skills of the driver,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.270
its braking performance can
surpass even that of ABS.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.180
In extended out-of-corner acceleration,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.880
the Evo-Six will probably
pull ahead of the Eight-Six...

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.330
...but through cornering work
utilizing its light weight,

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.060
the Eight-Six should be able to close that gap.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.080
<i>Quit keepin' up with me!</i>
<i>You're startin' to piss me off.</i>

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.380
<i>If this is how you wanna play it,</i>
<i>whatever happens is on your head!</i>

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.690
<i>Whatever. I should be able to lose him</i>
<i>once I enter the final, high-speed section.</i>

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.260
<i>I'm in a completely different speed range...</i>
<i>from some stupid Eight-Six!</i>

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.580
Keisuke.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.750
Actually, before the race started, Fujiwara
said something that's been bothering me...

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.380
He really said that?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.980
Yes. It's probably just a scare tactic,
but it got me a little concerned,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.890
so I thought I'd tell you, Keisuke.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.620
I wouldn't put it past those guys to do that.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.090
Give me a break! Just how
rotten are these guys?!

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.260
We should hurry and call our guys, too!

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.630
All it would take would be
a word from you, Keisuke!

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.630
No, Kenta.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.070
Huh?

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.340
It could be just a bluff.
Don't get all worked up over it.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.110
But Keisuke! If it's for real, there'll be
nothing we can do about it! They...

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.950
They already outnumber us.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.450
I know.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.610
I know that, which is why I'm telling
you not to get worked up about it.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.190
<i>I can keep up... A little poorly,</i>
<i>but I don't feel like I'll lose.</i>

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.360
<i>So the real problem is the driver.</i>

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.160
<i>That one time, the person</i>
<i>who pulled out in front of me...</i>

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.150
<i>...was my father.</i>

00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.210
<i>This guy's braking doesn't</i>
<i>hold a candle to Pops'.</i>

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:14.020
<i>Oh! Now I get it. That's the weak point!</i>

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:26.500
Still, being told something like that has
probably gotten Fujiwara a little rattled.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.540
In terms of diversionary tactics, I think
it's quite effective for a race like this.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.240
I think so, too.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:39.380
I told him to forget everything that doesn't
matter and concentrate on the race, but...

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.720
It's not as easy as that, is it?

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.390
It's a whole different kind of
pinch for Fujiwara this time.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.090
No.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.930
Fujiwara is not that fragile.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.030
Ryosuke...

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.940
He's right. Anyone who's raced
Fujiwara even once would understand.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.430
He normally seems harmless,
but once he starts racing...

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.210
...his concentration shoots to pro-racing levels.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.660
<i>His weak point is...</i>

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.560
<i>...braking!</i>

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.010
<i>Shit! For some weak-ass Eight-Six</i>
<i>to be able to run this fast...!</i>

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.240
<i>I don't know what kind of trick he's</i>
<i>pulled, but this is pissing me off!</i>

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.650
<i>It'll be trouble if he comes</i>
<i>chargin' in half-assed.</i>

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.450
<i>I've gotta safely make it</i>
<i>outta this low-speed section!</i>

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.530
<i>His line has changed...</i>

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.620
<i>He's checking my cornering speed</i>
<i>and keeping his guard up!</i>

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.040
Theoretically speaking...

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.370
If the Evo-Six were to begin
maneuvering defensively,

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.940
it would enter corners tighter.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.010
Should its driver fail to consider offensive
tactics coming from the outside...

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.610
...that is where Fujiwara would strike.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.170
<i>There's wide open space on the outside!</i>

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.660
<i>All right!</i>

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.710
They're here? Okay, understood.
It's still the middle of the race,

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.480
so have them wait down
there till it's over. Yeah.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.680
Those are some pretty scary guys,
so make sure you don't step out of line.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.890
It looks like they're here.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.650
You don't say...

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.340
The driver of that Evo-Six is by no means slow.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.510
His defining characteristic is, put simply,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.710
that his racing makes clever use
of high-tech electronic devices.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:28.220
As for braking, he makes masterful
use of the benefits afforded by ABS.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.190
With no special skill,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.890
he can employ high-level braking
that makes full use of the tires' grip.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.960
However, his senses may or may not be such

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.640
that he can adapt to changes in his situation.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.470
If he can, countering the braking point

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.480
at which he approaches
each corner will be difficult.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.040
Whether Fujiwara can do that will
determine the outcome of this race.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.710
<i>Bad move!</i>

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.620
<i>This bastard just won't quit!</i>

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.740
<i>Just a little farther.</i>

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.140
<i>After we pass just one more...</i>

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.680
<i>...it's the high-speed area where</i>
<i>I can open it up full-throttle!</i>

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.930
<i>What the...?! My front tires have lost their grip!</i>

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.510
<i>Yes!</i>

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:21.330
<i>Dammit! It's oil! I went too far into the in-line!</i>

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.890
<i>I passed right over some leftover oil!</i>

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.380
<i>We're not at the goal yet! I...</i>

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.510
<i>I just have to get back in front of him!</i>

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.700
<i>With this thing's racing capabilities,</i>

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.870
<i>I can turn the tables in the power section!</i>

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.730
<i>Just you watch!</i>

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.950
<i>I've got a two-liter turbo engine,</i>
<i>the fastest on the street racing scene!</i>

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.910
<i>There's no way it'll lose to</i>
<i>some wimpy 1.6-liter engine!</i>

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.060
The last part of the course is a
mid-speed section with wide roads.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.030
It is here that the speed
range is raised a notch.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.230
Then the Evo-Six is sure to--

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:27.930
You never learn, Kenta.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.900
Huh? But...

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.540
The more their speed increases, the harder
it becomes to accurately gauge braking...

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.910
...and the risk factor increases exponentially.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.410
Isn't that right, big brother?

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:47.820
On the downhill, the importance of technique
over power increases in high-speed areas.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.620
<i>Dammit! It's no good!</i>

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.800
<i>That asshole's takin' the</i>
<i>corner without braking!</i>

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:20.130
<i>I... I don't believe it. That racing's incredible...</i>

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.530
Okay. Understood.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.710
Apparently, five or six suspicious-looking cars
are headed this way, coming up toward us.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.180
What do we do, Ryosuke?

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.880
The situation would seem to
preclude our scheduled timed race...

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.450
Let's get things ready so we can
pull out at a moment's notice.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.910
The safety of all our team
members is top priority.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:14.300
Fumihiro, if worse comes to worst,
Keisuke and I will remain behind to buy time.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.930
You look for an opportunity
to take the others and flee.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.240
But I... Ryosuke...

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.810
I thought there was a risk of this occurring
during one of our expeditionary races.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.310
We have prepared for the worst.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.150
It's just like he said, Fumihiro.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.820
I'm used to this sort of thing. Don't worry.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.060
I'll find a way to get through this.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:45.160
All right. In a time like this,
you're our only hope, Keisuke.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.000
Keisuke! I'll stay with you!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.470
You go along with the others.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.570
But...

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.570
Don't let Ryosuke get hurt.
I'm counting on you.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.280
Yeah. Just leave it to me.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.280
Ryosuke, I'll...

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.480
Don't you worry, Fujiwara.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.090
There they are.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.460
Everyone! Get into Vans #1 and #2!

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.830
We're gonna watch us a fun little show.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.500
We'll get to see that uppity bastard
in the FD cryin' like a girl.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.070
Yeah.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:07.010
With a chance like this, we should
join in too, and blow off a little steam.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.650
After all, we didn't make
a single yen off of this.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:16.850
Shit! All the effort we put into this,
and it amounted to nothing.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:18.820
Let's do it!

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:24.160
After all, our guy's an ex-motorcycle
gang leader, a real son of a bitch!

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.990
Those other guys are gonna get pounded!

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.590
<i>This guy sure looks like a badass...</i>

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:59.120
Supposedly, he's the former leader of some
famous huge gang in northern Kanto!

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.930
Don't move from there, brother.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.270
It's you, huh?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.050
It was so dark I couldn't tell
it was you at all, Keisuke.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.780
It's been too long, sir.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.950
These guys are friends of yours?

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.120
You're not keeping very
good company, are you?

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.390
Uh, well, I wouldn't go so far
as to call them "friends."

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.950
They just asked me for a favor...

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:47.790
Bastards! They've done something
rude to you, haven't they?

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:54.310
I guess. But it's over with,
so no need to worry about it now.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.750
More to the point, your cars
are in the way. Move them.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:00.350
I'm very sorry, I'll do it right now.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.020
Did you hear him or what?!

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.650
Yessir!

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.370
What gives, Keisuke? You know him?

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:26.040
Uh, well, I guess he's an old acquaintance
from when I was young and careless...

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.580
My little brother back when
I was still a troublemaker.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.050
"Little brother"?

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:36.790
Well, in any case, that was a big help, Keisuke.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.690
For a while there, I wondered
what would happen to us...

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:43.890
But now we can go home
without a scratch on us or our cars.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.120
You certainly are incredible, Keisuke.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.770
You've really made me look bad.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:58.900
Do you not even know who
Keisuke Takahashi is, <i>bitch</i>?!

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.080
On top of that, Project D is so damn cool,

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.880
everybody in the Gunma
area knows about 'em.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.090
Shitbird, did you forget that <i>I'm</i> from Gunma?!

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.390 line:50 %
"Gunma"

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.830
I-I-I didn't know! Please forgive me!

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.630
We didn't know anythin' at all!

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.670
We're not even involved so,
uh, please forgive us.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.270
You're friggin' dreamin', cupcake!

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:32.840
In a bit, I'm gonna teach all you guys a lesson.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.830
Just wait, dammit!!

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.090
As Keisuke's FD is incapable
of functioning normally,

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.960
I'd like to cancel the timed race.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.100
Is that all right?

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.300
Yes, it's just fine!

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.640
All right, we're moving out!
Everyone, let's go!

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.870
Yes! We've completely
dominated the Saitama area!

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.860
<i>Somehow, this latest race gave me a hint.</i>

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.230
<i>The way to beat it... is this!</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.470
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:16.610
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.500
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.450
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
