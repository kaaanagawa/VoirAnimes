"Steep Curve"

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.330
What do you think about today's race?
What kind of outlook should we have?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.730
Personally, I'm scared.
About Keisuke's race today.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.300
Huh? You're scared? Is this
course's downhill that difficult?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.510
No, that's not what I meant.
How can I put this?

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.980
Even if a car's settings
are tuned for the hillclimb,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.080
once you go up, you'll
have to come down, right?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.720
Well, yeah.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.320
In other words, Keisuke's run the
downhill as many times as the hillclimb,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.530
so his downhill techniques
have steadily gotten better, too.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.730
Then the same goes for you, right?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.660
No, because our power differential is too great.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.900
On the uphill, there's no way the
Eight-Six could keep up with his FD...

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.740
But the FD is incredibly fast,
even on the downhill.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.180
I don't think there's much
of a difference between us.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.080
You're not serious!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.250
I get that general idea
from watching him practice.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.280
As the team downhiller, it's sort of unsettling.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.030
What I'm scared of is being
shown Keisuke's true power

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.020
when he takes the downhill with full intent.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.830
<i>He's left me behind? No. I can feel him.</i>

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.890
<i>He's up ahead!</i>

"Act 21: Dogfight"

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.580
So he preserved his tires during the hillclimb
to bet everything on the downhill, huh?

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.990
That's a pretty smart idea. Not bad.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.750
Like it or not, I'm gonna have to get serious!

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.760
Oops.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.030
I was about to fall silent there.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.190
Hyaa!

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.540
In a street race, a gap of
six seconds isn't that great.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:47.040
If that FD can't catch up to Ko on
the downhill, that's when we win.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.790
But if he does catch up...

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.190
If there's no clear winner,
we just go to the next round, right?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.800
That's incorrect. If this isn't
settled in the first race,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.200
it would be a tremendous
disadvantage for Ko...

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.340
...because in the second round,
the FD would go first.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.510
You know what that means. Both the
pursuer and the pursued will feel

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.210
the pressure of being unable
to see their opponent.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.520
Even if distance opens up between them,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.180
it will be a dead heat where
every millisecond counts.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.550
One, two!

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.170
Awesome! He shortcutted
over the roadside gutter!

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.040
Still, he'd go that far with something
in the GT-R's weight class?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.250
Because for Hoshino, there is no second round.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.880
No matter what, he has to finish
this race in the first round.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.850
Here comes the FD!

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.100
This one's taking a shortcut too,
like it's only natural.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.200
They have the same way of thinking, is that it?

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.980
All things said, this is one intense race.
Not being able to see your opponent

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.750
means you can't drop your
guard even for a second.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.240
A race where you're going neck
and neck would be a lot less stress.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.310
<i>I see him! All right.</i>

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.490
<i>Four seconds... No, maybe less.</i>

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.760
<i>I've definitely gained on him</i>
<i>since the turnaround point.</i>

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.690
<i>Rather than some old God Foot dude...</i>

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.790
<i>...the winner of the downhill will be me!</i>

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.040
He's come this far, huh?
He's better than I thought.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.010
But I know he's comin' to close the gap.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.280
Now it's a game of tag,
to outrun him till the goal line!

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.530
From the beginning, that's the
kind of, uh, race this has been.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.150
Hngrar!

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.720
<i>Coming up is what will decide this race!</i>

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.910
This heat will probably
take its toll on Ko, as well.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.980
Ooh, this is tough.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.510
A handful, all right, a handful.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.820
This youngster from Gunma is something else.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:19.590
Even on the downhill, he's gettin'
closer and closer to my R34.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.360
<i>All right! I'm definitely closing the gap on him.</i>

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.530
This really is fun. It's been a
long time since I've felt like this.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.240
One, two, three!

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.790
I swear... Now it's getting to
where it's hard for <i>me</i> to breathe.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.700
We've never faced this kind
of development before.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.900
I think the six-second time lag
at the turnaround point

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:02.710
might have made him push forward
into a very dangerous zone.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.240
Even if things progress according
to the scenario I have scripted,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.610
his chances of winning are fifty-fifty.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.550
His opponent is of the highest caliber.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.750
Dammit! Tire traction is less than half, eh?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.570
I've used the front tires for all they're worth.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.130
The weight of the car's frame
is finally takin' its toll.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.000
He's come up a hair's breadth from me.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.300
That margin I had is now all but gone?!

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.030
Fine!

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.710
<i>Just one more...</i>

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.050
<i>Just one more...</i>

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.450
Then I'm comin' in with a deathwish!

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.130
Hey! You bastard!

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.000
They've gotten close!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.300
They're about to tear around the last corner!

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.020
It's no good! He can't lose him.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.850
<i>Ko...</i>

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.920
<i>So it's no good, huh?</i>

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:15.100
Yes! Keisuke made it to the second round.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.010
No way. It can't be...

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.750
<i>The</i> Hoshino...

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.120
...couldn't hold onto that big of a lead?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.950
Mr. Joshima!

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.090
I'll say this for the sake of Ko's reputation:

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.260
his opponent is running
a truly incredible race.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:41.760
Without a doubt, their driver is of a
level far above what we'd expected.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.070
He may be our enemy,
but all I can say is, "Well done."

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.740
That was a brutal and most incredible race.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.910
What?! This isn't the time
to go openly admiring them!

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.040
The opponent will be
leading in the second round...

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.980
You said it yourself, didn't you?
Now the conditions of the race

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.620
will be overwhelmingly against us!

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.420
Yes, well... True enough, I did say that.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.990
That's if one were to think
of this in the "normal" way.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:12.330
But the driver that is Kozo Hoshino
is about to enter his true element.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.440
All right, we're moving into the second round!

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.940
Starting in five seconds! Four!

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.510
Three! Two! One!

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.140
Go!

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.690
<i>The first round was to my liking,</i>
<i>one of smart progression.</i>

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:48.300
<i>However, this strategy has one small hole in it.</i>

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.670
<i>How will our opponent react to that?</i>

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.100
<i>This second round will be turbulent...</i>
<i>Make no mistake!</i>

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.700
<i>Give it a rest, old man. I already</i>
<i>know you've got good traction.</i>

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.230
Hey, what gives? Is that all it's got,
that rotary rocket of yours?!

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:43.090
<i>I know from the first round that I lose</i>
<i>when coming out of corners on the hillclimb.</i>

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.360
<i>No matter how much he rides me,</i>
<i>I just have to not let him pass.</i>

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.360
<i>If I can keep outrunning him like this till</i>
<i>the turnaround point, this race is mine.</i>

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.760
<i>I won't be beaten on the downhill!</i>

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.410
It looks like they've started a second round.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.010
Looks like it.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:10.680
Sure enough, I guess that lightweight FD
was pretty fast on the downhill.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.520
This will make things tough for Purple Shadow.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.120
They're both big-framed cars, so pulling
ahead on the hillclimb will be hard.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.090
So Project D's strategy
will decide the race, eh?

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.760
He's a bright one, all right, Ryosuke Takahashi.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.860
Still...

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.370
Something bothers me.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.870
What's that?

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.100
Ryosuke Takahashi is certainly a cunning foe...

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:42.530
But I don't think Kozo Hoshino could have
completely failed to see this coming.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.890
After all, it was Hoshino that
chose to lead in the first round.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.990
If he loses, then for a driver
called the "God Foot,"

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.790
wouldn't that be far too little planning?

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:59.630
Well...

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:07.470
I think Hoshino has some sort of
plan in mind. I can't help but feel that.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.740
<i>If it's some sort of loophole in the rules...</i>
<i>then what on earth could it be?</i>

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.460
Hyaa!

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:41.100
<i>Forget it. I don't know what</i>
<i>kind of power that thing packs,</i>

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.660
<i>but there's absolutely no way</i>
<i>I'd let you pass me now!</i>

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:53.310
That's the shape of it, eh?
I've got the general picture.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.800
<i>What is this? This mood like</i>
<i>people are expecting something...</i>

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.670
<i>Gimme a break. There's no</i>
<i>reason anything'll happen.</i>

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.910
<i>As a racer with experience</i>
<i>at running mountain passes,</i>

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.380
<i>I can at least say that for sure!</i>

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:27.250
<i>There's no way he could pull</i>
<i>ahead on a course like this!</i>

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.420
<i>Soon they'll be here at the turnaround</i>
<i>point, the yellow FD still in the lead.</i>

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.160
<i>They'll circle around this</i>
<i>pylon and head back down.</i>

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:40.220
<i>In that instant, Keisuke's</i>
<i>victory will be certain!</i>

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.620
<i>The top is just ahead. We'll be up there soon.</i>

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.680
<i>I can do it. This race is mine!</i>

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.760
They're here! There they are! They're comin' in!

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.920
Okay!

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.040
They're comin' in side-by-side!

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.950
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.320
Hoshino's out in front!

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.350
It can't be. Don't tell me...

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.130
He was waiting for the instant when
the turn toward the downhill begins?!

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:23.800
What a crazy thing to do! That GT-R
came charging in without hesitation.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.970
If Keisuke hadn't moved, it would've
been a terrible head-on crash!

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.540
Screw you! You'd do something like this?!

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.880
<i>No, that's not right. They may</i>
<i>have looked about the same,</i>

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.620
<i>but our opponent entered the spin</i>
<i>turn a split-second earlier.</i>

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.050
<i>That's where the lead</i>
<i>position was taken from us.</i>

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.990
<i>I timed it so we'd be side-by-side</i>
<i>when we came out of the corner.</i>

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.500
<i>That was quite satisfactory, if I say so myself.</i>

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:58.330
<i>He got me. Now all I can do is overtake him!</i>

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.910
It looks like Keisuke had the tables
turned on him at the turnaround point.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.240
As I thought. Sure enough,
he did not pass up his opportunity.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.510
This puts us at an overwhelming disadvantage.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:16.090
All we can do now is bet on Keisuke's
natural ability to spring into action.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.750
The rougher and more
heated this race becomes,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.690
the higher the probability.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.820
The more turbulent this is,
the greater our chances.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:31.700
<i>The one thing that worries</i>
<i>me is Ko falling silent.</i>

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.030
<i>Don't get too heated.</i>

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.880
<i>Drifting, huh? If that's how you want to play it...</i>

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.780
What?!

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.130
Hoshino pulled ahead at the turnaround point!

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.300
Yeah!

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.800
I knew there was no way he'd lose!

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.800
Oh. So that was Hoshino's plan?

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.570
There they are!

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.410
Drift vs. drift?!

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.540
The GT-R is a 4WD, right?!

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.710
This thing's gettin' more and more heated!

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.080
What's goin' on with Hoshino?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.580
What on earth is going on?

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:26.490
It could be that this is
according to Hoshino's plan.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.420
Without a doubt, his tires have lost their grip,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:33.330
making it easier to understeer
on downhill corners.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.760
If he fishtailed the rear section at corner entry,

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.630
he could control the front-end push.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:43.740
At first glance it appears utterly reckless,
but there's sound reasoning behind it.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.010
Also...

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:50.310
If the GT-R drifts its big rear section
on already narrow streets,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.580
it takes up that much more space,
effectively blocking the way...

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.110
...creating a barricade that
stretches the width of the road.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.370
<i>I hadn't planned on gettin' so flashy,</i>

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.540
<i>but if my opponent is gonna take</i>
<i>things this far, I can't back down now!</i>

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:19.110
<i>This is a different world, beyond reason.</i>

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.770
<i>And I won't let anyone criticize!</i>

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.350
I just don't understand it.
Mr. Joshima, they're drifting.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.020
Both Mr. Hoshino's GT-R and the pursuing FD...

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.730
Isn't the sensible thing to do to race
with a little more care for their tires?

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:43.070
Well, sometimes the only ones who
understand are the people holding the wheel.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.300
Sure enough, they're cut from the same cloth.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:51.870
I guess we just keep quiet and watch these
two fools engage in their battle of wills.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.510
They're both up on the main stage now...

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:02.020
There is a logical reason for
Kozo Hoshino's repeated use of drift.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.720
However, there is no such
reason supporting Keisuke's.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.230
Put simply, it is the willfulness of one
who drives a rear-wheel vehicle.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:14.830
Keisuke has responded with
competitive spirit rather than reasoning...

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.670
Fight drift with drift.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.700
There is one aspect in which Kozo Hoshino
and Keisuke closely resemble each other.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.170
Keisuke's actions make
no disguise of his feelings,

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.880
which in this case fuels
Hoshino's fighting spirit.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.870
That is what suddenly made
this a battle of drifting.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.720
<i>My tires!</i>

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.530
<i>Ko is probably enjoying this</i>
<i>more than he can stand.</i>

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.870
<i>But Ko, this turn of events</i>
<i>will count more against</i>

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.710
<i>the GT-R, with its heavy frame.</i>

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:02.980
<i>Drawing this out would be</i>
<i>disadvantageous in terms of tires...</i>

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.710
<i>He should've known that from the start.</i>

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:11.420
<i>They're not too far off now. I'm sure</i>
<i>Keisuke has no intention of quitting.</i>

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.920
<i>We still don't know what will happen</i>
<i>until that goal line is crossed!</i>

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.500
<i>Dammit! It's overshooting all on its own!</i>

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.360
--All right!
--Yes!

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.470
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:16.610
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.500
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.450
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
