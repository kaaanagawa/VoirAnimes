Ah. Good job.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.240
Listen, I'm gonna do the deliveries
tomorrow and the day after.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.410
How come? We said we'd
switch every other day, right?

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.150
I know, but... I think the team's going
out on another expedition next week,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.920
so I'm taking what I'd miss.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.820
Well, that's admirable of ya.
It's a long way from the old days

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.320
when you'd go out complainin'
about it. Is delivery that much fun?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.260
It's not really fun at all. It's just, if I
don't do the Akina run, I get anxious.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.700
When the team goes on the road,
we race unfamiliar courses, right?

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.100
Coming up with strategies for the
new course takes everything I've got

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.670
and I can't think of anything else.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.910
This is the first time I've
thought of it like this, but...

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.580
...when I do the Akina run, I feel really
relaxed and notice all sorts of things.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.730
It's not like I've completely
mastered driving the car yet.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.600
But even if I try out new things, it's gotta
be at Akina at first or it's no good.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.030
That's why... I'm not gonna say every day,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.800
but as much as possible, I'd like to
go out on the morning deliveries.

Welcome!

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.980
--Huh?
--Hey!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.560
Takumi?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.060
This is unusual, seeing you out so early.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.070
I've got the day off today.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.830
With nothing to do, I sort of ended up here.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.410
A fine youngster like yourself having nothing
to do on a day off? Now that's a problem!

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440
What about your girl?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.750
Haven't you heard anything
from Natsuki? Since last time.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.520
Since April, I've gotten a letter from her once.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.450
From what she wrote, she sounds
like she's enjoying herself.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.660
Knowing her, I think she got used to
Tokyo quickly and is getting along fine.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.200
You should go see her once in a while.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.760
No, not good!

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.200
Iketani, if you say something like that,
Takumi will fly off right now!

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.710
I'm not going. I'm busy, and don't
have time for that sort of thing.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.610
Wh-What?

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.380
Between work and the team,
I've got all I can handle.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.520
I can't think of anything else.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.950
Is that so? Still, when you say it like that...

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.890
If you turn into...

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.160
...a carbon copy of Kenji,
don't come crying to me!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.000
That's right! He's a good age,
but he doesn't have a girlfriend...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.830
A lonely existence where you
end up here in your free time!

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.900
Are you okay with that?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.010
I don't wanna hear that
from the likes of you two!

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.640
Kenji!

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.510
You'll pardon me for my lonely,
girlfriendless existence!

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.650
Uh...

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.720
I swear. Hey, I've been hearing things,
Takumi. Project D sure is incredible!

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.260
I saw the new expeditionary file.
It gave me the shivers, for real!

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.030
Right now, Takumi and Keisuke Takahashi
are the two poster boys for the Gunma area!

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.840
You guys are just <i>too</i> talented.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.910
No matter where you go,
no one can stop you, huh?

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.440
That's not true. It's not as if winning is easy.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.250
It's always a battle right to the end.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.880
And there's no way of knowing what kind
of tough opponent will show up next.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.460
I'm really under a lot of pressure.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.930
And who will your next opponent be?
Is it already decided?

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.570
Yes. I think it was Toudou... The Toudou School.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.370
What? The Toudou School?!

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.140
Do you know it, sir?

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:20.240
Yeah. I've heard rumors. An ex-rally racer
turned shop president who started up

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.220
an advanced driving technique school
that's attracted young car enthusiasts.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.720
An advanced driving technique school?
They actually have something like that?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.590
Yeah. And with drifting as popular as
it is these days, it looks like these guys

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.960
are a bunch of balls-to-the-wall racers
whose only concern is mad speed!

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.800
There are guys who've graduated
the Toudou School and gone pro,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.010
and apparently several semi-pro-level
grads still prowl around the street scene.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.500
Y-You're gonna go up
against guys like that? Takumi...

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.360
Mr. Toudou. What is it you
wished to speak about?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.300
Daiki. They're coming tomorrow.
That expeditionary team.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.130
Project D?

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.500
Yes. About that...

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.940
Mr. Toudou, this car...

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.480
It's a demo car we're using.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.780
You wanna give it a try?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.850
Thank you for the opportunity,

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.120
but I'll use my own car.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.160
The demo cars of Toudou &amp; Co.
are quite astounding,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.630
so much so that the race
would be over all too quickly.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.560
I wouldn't feel as if I'd
won by my own abilities.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.300
You goddamn fool! Quit talkin' that crap!

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.970
...is what I'd like to say, but I already
thought that would be your answer.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:03.210
Whatever. Do what you want.
It's all a game anyway.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.690
Well, do your best.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.730
I'll go and watch for myself,
if I get to feelin' like it.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:21.260
What the hell, Daiki? You're gonna
turn him down? What a waste!

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:25.400
If it was me, I would've gladly
taken the boss up on his offer.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.340
This car is awesome. It's so awesome,
you start giggling once you're inside!

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.550
I know, but...

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.280
...I thought that using your own
car was a rule or something.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.960
And my EK is tricked out to where
it's unbeatable on the downhill.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.130
Look, don't put too much stock into this, Daiki.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.960
I've heard of Project D,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.730
and compared to the intense training
we've gone through at the Toudou School,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.970
the level of those guys is disappointingly low.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.610
Yeah, I know that. But...

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:08.380
Somehow... Somehow, doesn't it
piss you off? This Project D thing.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.580
I don't know about the Internet
and homepages and stuff,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.120
but this whole thing of showing off
what they're doing to a large audience

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.420
makes it clear that
they've gotten far too uppity.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.490
I guess.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.760
This showoff manner of theirs is inexcusable!

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.800
I want to show them that there
are a lot of fast racers out there!

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.110
Yeah, you're right. Really drive the
point home to 'em... with your EK9.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.600
Yeah.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.680
Say, Ryosuke...

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.650
I've been thinking about this for a while,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.350
and don't you think the D homepage
is a little too confrontational?

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.990
No, it's fine.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.260
It's just fine the way it is.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.090
When we arrive at our destinations,
we must play the part of the hated villain.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.530
But if that's the case...

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:03.170
Yes. Our opponents will
become emotional, agitated.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.970
The more so, the better.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.210
If it is not an urgent, frenzied race,
then it has no meaning.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:17.280
Winning races and setting new
records is one of D's objectives,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.220
but this project has another, separate purpose.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.820
And therein lies the true
meaning behind the initial "D"!

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.030
Hold on a second. This is all news to me.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.560
Yes, it would be.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.730
I have yet to inform anyone of it.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.500
That's pretty shifty, Ryosuke.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.370
Okay, so tell me. What does the "D" stand for?

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.810
You'll know soon enough, Fumihiro.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.970
And just when is "soon"?

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.350
When this project is complete.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.350
It looks like they'll clear out
all the local cars for us.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.220
The course will be reserved just for us.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:36.760
Reserved or not, there'll be a
route for general cars, right?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.460
No, this road is still under construction,
so it's not open for traffic.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.400
It looks like there won't be any
general cars at all going through.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.100
Under construction...

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.870
So that's why. Even just watching the video,
it seemed like an incredible course.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.080
There's some serious height
differential and winding roads...

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.580
It's newly paved and the
roads have plenty of width,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.490
but there are lots of falling rocks, and the
road surface can't exactly be called pretty.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.070
Keisuke!

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.000
Huh? You're here? What are you doing?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.500
What do you mean, "You're here?"
I came as the driver for the second van.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.250
Keisuke! Once the settings are ready,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.160
please let me sit in the
passenger's seat for one race!

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.530
I want to see your driving
up close, learn from it!

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.870
I don't know. I'm not sure
it'll be possible to do that.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.800
This time will be especially intense.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.840
It will?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.810
Don't you feel anything at all, Kenta?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.460
All right. Preparations are okay!

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.290
You can go now, Keisuke.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.780
Okay.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.500
We're going, too.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.990
All right.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.010
They're so confident, it's eerie.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.280
For them to open up the
entire course, let us borrow it...

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.010
Even I can taste how much pressure there is.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.550
Just what kind of race are they
going to run? The Toudou School.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.620
Kyoichi Sudou of Team Emperor
is a graduate of the Toudou School,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.090
which should give us a general idea, yes?

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.290
Underhanded beasts like him abound.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.630
Guys on Sudou's level abound?!

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.800
Hey Ryosuke, D's only just gotten started.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.440
Shouldn't we have put this off till a little later?

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.610
No.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.240
If the project is such that
it could be crushed here,

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.080
then it could not have won later anyway.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.780
In this one night, we shall
put ourselves to the test.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.220
We shall unify our efforts
and crush the Toudou School!

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.470
Project D, eh? They seemed more
respectable than I'd imagined.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.670
To be honest, I was impressed.
As a team, they looked quite efficient.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:08.910
Yeah, I feel the same.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:15.110
Those three minivans were stuffed
with tires and parts for the undersides.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:21.180
The FD and the Eight-Six each had
their own mechanics, all working busily.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.750
They were a pretty capable bunch.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.420
Some really smart guy's probably
giving out the orders, huh?

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.460
Judging by appearances, they may
be more skilled than we thought.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.200
Up till yesterday, I wasn't
looking forward to this at all, but...

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.170
A race by outside rules sure looks fun!

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:43.140
Races between Toudou students are
way too strict and are no fun at all.

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.840
They get you for the tiniest mistake

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.850
and you'll get chewed out by
Mr. Toudou if you slip up even a little.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:54.780
Compared to that, a race by outside
rules is only half-serious, right?

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.190
I'd like to try. Let me do it!

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.860
I wanna try, too!

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.890
Come on, be reasonable.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:10.820
Defer to the graduates, your seniors,
and let the active racers take the lead here.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.400
Daiki's EK will take the downhill...

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.210
...and my Integra Turbo will take the uphill.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.140
Well, I guess it can't be helped.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.880
In exchange, on the off chance that you lose,
we're not gonna cut y'all any slack.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.150
'Cause you'll be muddying
the name of the Toudou School.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.190
Yeah! Whoever loses has to pay
a penalty of one million yen!

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.890
A million yen?!

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.560
That's pretty steep...

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.690
This isn't funny, sir!

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.850
Water temperature is stable.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.220
How is the traction?

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.120
It feels great. I can really open the throttle.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:08.690
Once you've put in the oil, I'm gonna try
another two or three runs with this setup.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.890
All right.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.260
The twists in this road are incredible...

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.900
This course's downhill is dangerous!

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.400
I changed out your brake pads
with some really durable ones.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.610
That will cause a corresponding drop in
your absolute braking. Be careful about that.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.980
Got it. I'm going now, Matsumoto.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.410
I'd like to check your pads after five laps,
so come back here once you're done.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:31.900
Okay.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.930
<i>The faces of Ryosuke and</i>
<i>the others are different.</i>

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.460
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.670
<i>It's a sense of anxiousness they didn't</i>
<i>have when on expeditions as the Red Suns.</i>

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.940
<i>I think something incredible is happening.</i>

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.740
<i>I'm scared. So scared I wanna run away!</i>

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.480
<i>So acting as a driver for Project D...</i>

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.070
<i>...begins by learning to endure this?</i>

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.290
Iketani! Itsuki!

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.590
It's coming up tonight, huh?
Project D vs. the Toudou School!

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.960
You really have a lot of free time, don't you?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.200
Hey, aren't <i>you</i> looking forward to it?
Seeing what kind of race Takumi will run.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.000
Yes, but it's not like we can head to
Tochigi and watch for ourselves, is it?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.310
Why don't you go, Kenji?
After all, you're free, right?

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.980
Shut up! Quit saying I'm free
because I don't have a girlfriend!

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.620
It's not like I'm coming right out and saying
anything about not having a girlfriend...

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.520
--You <i>are</i> saying that, aren't you?!
--Nah, nah.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.960
<i>Tonight, eh? But this time, even Takumi...</i>

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.030
The sun's finally going down, huh?

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:02.840
I couldn't sleep very well last night.
This day sure has felt long.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.470
Why are things so tense?

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:12.080
Maybe because yesterday we couldn't
see the local guys in their cars at all.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.420
It's nerve-wracking not being able
to see your opponents' racing.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.090
We can't get any data on them either.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:24.490
But the flip side of that is, they
didn't get to see our racing either.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:28.600
I've got a bad feeling.
Or maybe I'm over-thinking things.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.370
Sure, there's such a thing as having
a level of absolute confidence,

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:37.770
but we haven't been blown off like that
once since our days with the Red Suns.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:43.780
Fumihiro, that stuff doesn't
bother me in the slightest.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:50.290
I've raced different people before joining
this team, and it's always been like this.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:55.930
I can concentrate more if I <i>don't</i>
know anything about my opponent.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:01.100
It's about racing down the road in front of you,
not thinking about needless things, right?

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.030
Right now, I'm enjoying this
so much that I can't take it.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.800
Fujiwara...

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.040
I don't know how to put it, but...

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.910
...this is a whole lot of fun.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.740
Oh.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.750
When I hear it like that,
Fujiwara's actually right.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.280
He is, isn't he?

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.920
<i>That's incredible, being able</i>
<i>to enjoy a situation like this.</i>

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.290
<i>He's "big," but on a strange scale.</i>

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.120
<i>He's a different type of driver</i>
<i>from Ryosuke and Keisuke.</i>

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.000
<i>Akina's Eight-Six, Takumi Fujiwara.</i>

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.630
<i>It's no wonder we're all worked up,</i>
<i>you having made it this far.</i>

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:43.230
<i>We've got not choice but to believe in</i>
<i>the downhill ace that Ryosuke chose...</i>

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.580
Daiki?

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.450
I'd like to check the brake area, so I'm going
to borrow a jack and some tools, Sakai.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.750
Sure.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.620
A final check for tonight's race?

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.530
Nothing so dramatic...

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:09.370
To be honest, my heart's not in this.
I can't get myself motivated.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.870
I sort of picked up on that. You haven't
been acting too excited since last night.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.440
It's because of the other guys' cars, right?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.010
Yeah! You get it, right?

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.980
Most of all, that Eight-Six.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.010
Even if you went running circles around it,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.980
it would just be like bullying the weak, right?

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.790
What I saw yesterday has
really gotten me bummed out.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:38.690
No matter how good the driver is, I can't
find a single thing to get fired up about!

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.530
Even that FD would've
made a better opponent.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.470
This is just like you, this hang-up
of yours. What's the big deal?

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.070
Everyone knows it doesn't
matter what car it is,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.710
when it comes to the downhill,
there's no way you're gonna lose!

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.340
Change your mood around

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.850
and show him just how big a gap
in skill there is between you two.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:03.320
These guys were the ones who challenged us.
There's no reason to hold back, right?

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.920
Even if your opponent is
some inferior Eight-Six.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.770
I'm Takumi Fujiwara.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.200
Daiki Ninomiya.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.380
<i>He's a young one. This is</i>
<i>Project D's downhill racer, eh?</i>

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.050
We'd like to run these as lead/follow races.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.350
Choose whichever position
you like for the first race.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.290
Are you for real? We're local racers,
and we've got the advantage.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.620
This is our racing style.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.030
That's awfully confident of you.

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.860
Fine. In that case...

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.230
For the first race, I'll follow.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.870
Okay, then shall we begin?

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.900
You're okay coming from behind?

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.210
Wouldn't going first have
gotten this over with easier?

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.040
Probably... But there's been a little snag.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.660
You get it, don't you? This guy isn't
the walk in the park we thought he'd be.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.500
Ah. He chose to come behind for the first race?

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.800
Put Fujiwara on.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.770
Fujiwara. It's Ryosuke.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.270
Hello?

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:33.080
Fujiwara, listen closely.
I have two basic instructions.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.810
Okay... Okay.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:38.780
Understood.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.650
We're counting on you, Fujiwara.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.690
Fumihiro.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.350
Today's opponent is really amazing.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.820
I can feel it. He's incredibly fast.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.440
<i>Awesome...</i>

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.850
Start out slow, then open the throttle
when you come out of the first right.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.290
The Eight-Six will start first,
with you following.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.880
Understood.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:35.870
<i>The driver of that Eight-Six seems</i>
<i>a lot more legit than I'd imagined.</i>

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:41.210
<i>I chose to come from behind</i>
<i>because I'd gotten a little curious.</i>

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:47.050
<i>Why an Eight-Six? What can</i>
<i>you do with a car like that?</i>

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.920
<i>I'll have you show me!</i>

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.760
Okay, go! Let's get started!

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.830
--They're starting!
--The downhill's gonna start!

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.370
Can you hear that, Ryosuke?
It'll be starting soon...

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.900
The critical night for Project D
to ask itself what it's capable of!

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.740
<i>Hey, the coming of a new generation</i>

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.650
<i>Calling now for the arrival of a new era</i>

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:56.790
<i>How long are you going to</i>
<i>pretend you've forgotten?</i>

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.890
<i>(Tension that seems like it'll</i>
<i>rip my heart) This heartache...</i>

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.900
<i>Within those eyes,</i>
<i>something that can't be held back...</i>

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:12.330
<i>(Yeah, this image that won't let me go)</i>
<i>...stares intently at the night</i>

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:22.180
<i>Yes, the two who didn't even know how</i>

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.120
<i>to reach out and touch someone's</i>
<i>heart are already, from here...</i>

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.250
<i>(Hey, the coming of a new generation,</i>
<i>Check it, This will blast your love)</i>

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:36.590
<i>Blast my desire, break off the barrier</i>

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:42.300
<i>Strike the sleeping dream awake</i>
<i>(Skillz enough to rend the night!)</i>

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.770
<i>Blast my desire, stronger than fire</i>

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:53.680
<i>A risky tune that rocks the times</i>

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:57.010
<i>Blast my desire</i>

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.280
<i>(Calling now for the arrival of a new era,</i>
<i>be what you wanna be)</i>

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.820
<i>Blast my desire</i>

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.120
<i>Blast my desire, whoa whoa whoa yeah</i>

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.690
<i>(Calling now for the arrival of a new era,</i>
<i>break what you wanna break)</i>
