I pulled it off somehow.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.890
It was a pretty tight race.
The car's settings were all wrong.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.060
I noticed it soon after the race started,
but there was nothing that could be done.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.030
The only thing to do was hold back on the
accelerator handling to try to save my tires.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.170
Still, that was impressive how you noticed

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.570
the opponent's weak point
at the last moment.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.010

"Touge Tea House"

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.240
It was the smallest thing.
Something caused her to wobble.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.850
She recovered well, but after that
her acceleration speed was sluggish,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.150
and it looked like I could ram her
from behind. That's when it hit me.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.020
Maybe the car had a peaky engine
with a substantial turbo lag.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.560
It's powerful at straight vertical racing,
but weak when it comes to horizontal racing.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.430
If I'd noticed that sooner, I might
not have had such a hard time.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.170
Do not forget today's
accelerator handling, Keisuke.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.710
When we return to Akagi, practice it
repeatedly till it is part of your repertoire.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.350
While not flashy, it is a
technique of great importance.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.080
It will dramatically increase your range
of tactics to improve tire performance.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.180
Yeah. So this is just as you'd planned, eh?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.890
I'm sorry.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.520
There's nothing for you to apologize for.
You ran the best race you could, right?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.970
Their driver was simply a notch above you.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.140
I thought he would become more
panicky, placing wear on his tires,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.280
but he has a genius-like ability to
adapt to the conditions of a race.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.110
He may be our opponent,
but all I can say is, "Well done."

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.620
Well, next up is the downhill.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.780

That's right. It's a bit unexpected, but
their guy chose to come from behind.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080
How's the check coming?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.780
The check's complete. You can go anytime.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.190

pull him along without shaking him off.

Once you clear the first hairpin,
you can do as you like.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.700
You can even increase your speed
all at once, ending the race sooner.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.000
Do you understand?
Not until after the first hairpin.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.100
Okay.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.770

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.670

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.700

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.480
It's started, huh? The downhill.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.310
I wish I could watch it...

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.220
Now that your race is finished, it's like I'm
relieved enough that I've gotten hungry!

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.760
There's still lots of food in Van #1 left
over from our convenience store run.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.930
Oh, really? Well, I'm going
to go eat something.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.260
What about you, Keisuke?

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.600
I'm fine.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.120
All right then.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.970
Um...

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.350
Really, thank you so much for everything.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.420
What the heck? I didn't do anything
for you to go thanking me like that.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.800
You did. You fixed my FD for me.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.630
Oh, that? Forget it. We settled that
before we'd even started racing, right?

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.870
But...

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.770
I've got something to be
grateful to you for, too.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.940
I made a few new discoveries
during today's race.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.520
You're a really great driver, and fast.
I'm not just saying that. I don't do flattery.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.020
I said some harsh things at first, but I
take them back. That was wrong of me.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.960
Y-You don't have to...

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.990
All right then, let's consider the matter closed.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.200
Um, I...

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.910
I enjoyed it. Today's race.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.540
I've never enjoyed anything so much.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.160
<i>He's incredible. Or rather, he's dangerous!</i>

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.250
<i>His corner entry is insane!</i>

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.840
Um...

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.280
Um... Um, here's the thing.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.370
Are you dating anyone right now, Takahashi?

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.560
No, not really. There's no one like that.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.290
As it is, I'm too busy to get involved
with some chick, and racing cars is--

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.790
Thank you very much!

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.400
H-Hey!

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.390
What was that about? Weirdo.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.390
<i>A little hard for me to come out...</i>

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.220
<i>He's so smooth, it's like he's gliding...</i>
<i>It's as if I could get sucked right in.</i>

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.760
<i>But why am I able to keep</i>
<i>up with him, even barely?</i>

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.170
<i>Because there's less of a slope here</i>
<i>compared to just after the start?</i>

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:32.760
<i>I can't believe that would be the only reason.</i>
<i>He should have more skill than just this.</i>

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.610
<i>My heart is pounding. I'm as excited as when</i>
<i>I'd just bought my car and run my first race.</i>

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.650
<i>All five senses are completely engaged,</i>
<i>imprinting themselves upon me.</i>

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.420
<i>All right, show me! Show me the true nature</i>
<i>of your superhuman speed and technique!</i>

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.090
Once the race starts, hold back for a
while and keep pace with the rear car.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.200
Even if a little distance opens between you,
pull him along without shaking him off.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.100
Once you clear the first hairpin,
you can do as you like.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.660
Do you understand? Not until
after the first hairpin.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.750
How was it, Nobuhiko?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.920
What are your thoughts after having gone
up against the Gunma area's downhiller?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.090
"How was it?" He ended the
race after the first hairpin.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.090
When I went up against that Eight-Six,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.330
it was a close race that
could have gone either way.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.730
After all, we took it as far as the fifth race.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.540
Because this course has a mix
of uphill stages, don't you think?

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.170
If it were a purely downhill course,

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.870
I wonder whether the race
would have lasted that long.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.610
Jeez! Way to hit a person where it hurts.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.450
The Eight-Six's downhill certainly
was enough to give me goose bumps.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.520
But...

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.690
...there was one thing that bothered me.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.450
I felt like the driver of that Eight-Six
kept pace with me on purpose.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.060
Why would he do that?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:41.430
I don't know. Maybe I'm just
reading too much into it.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.800
In any case...

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.940
Thanks to what he showed me,
I've come up with my own solution.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.470
A way to beat that Eight-Six.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.870
To beat the Eight-Six?!

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.140
That's right. The one and only way.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.610
A time trial race?

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.560
It's incredible, huh? His acceleration.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.300
I wonder what kind of course record he'll set.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.970
But today's race was just the opening
move toward the second round

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.960
of the Saitama battle.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.580
We couldn't ask for worthier opponents.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.450
And we'll stop them... Project D!

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.150
Thank you very much!

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.670
Welcome!

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.040
Hey!

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.370
Oh jeez, you <i>again</i>?

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.210
What kind of a greeting is "Oh jeez"?

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.110
Especially after I brought
a printout of D's homepage.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.710
Whoa, really?!

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.280
Show us that please, Kenji!

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.450
As always, they are victorious.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:13.060
They won the downhill and the hillclimb,
and even set a course record.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.660
Incredible, isn't it?

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.530
They've run a string of courses for the
very first time, and haven't lost once!

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.000
That world of theirs is a little
hard to even imagine, huh?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.570
I'd sure like to go watch!

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.340
Yeah... Saitama isn't that far.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.580
What do you say we go cheer
them on at their next race?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.880

Great job, Kyoko! It's awesome
that you were able to ask him that!

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.920
Especially given how little
experience you've had.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.190
Right?! I think so myself!

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.060
The fact that he doesn't have
a girlfriend is doubly lucky!

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.230
I bet he's got Kyoko on the brain right now!

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.770
I don't know...

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.670
Of course he does!

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.170
You've already let him know
that you're interested in him,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:08.210
which should make him feel good,
no matter what kind of guy he is.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.680
Aagh! What should I do?!

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.620
My darling, actually thinking about me?!

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.240
Now, now.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.920
I...

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.420
I want to be cute. I've never
once thought this before, but...

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.090
...I want to be cute, so badly.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.670
Keisuke... He's pretty popular
with the ladies, right?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.070
What are you talking about?! That was sudden!

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.240
It's just, well, I kind of got that impression.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.980
Yes, Keisuke's popular. Of course he is.
That's no reason to go bringing it up now.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.520
Yeah...

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.420
Anyway, these past few years, he doesn't
seem to have any interest in women.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.330
Huh?! Why not?

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.490
I guess because it's too much hassle.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.360
I'm sure that he broke up
with the last girl he was dating

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.140
after he bought the FD
and joined the Red Suns.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.970
He's the type of guy who puts all
his concentration into one thing.

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.670
Unlike Ryosuke, he's not efficient
enough to balance two things at once.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.390
He said he broke up with her because he
was busy and couldn't make time to meet.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.860
Still, he was out racing the
mountain pass every night,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.620
so he was probably completely occupied.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.670
Huh?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.900
Hey, that black FD...

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.990
<i>There she is!</i>

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.660
Hello.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:40.760
Hello...

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.400
I-I wonder if she came to see Keisuke.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.940
Probably.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.370
There's no "probably" about it.
Of course she did!

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.740
He's back!

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.540
You came all the way here?

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.120
I heard this was your home course.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.250
Do you race every day, even when
there's no expedition planned?

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.250
Not every day, but...

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.560
I've got an assignment
regarding accelerator handling.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.290
Right now, I'm sort of
focusing on that as I'm racing.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:45.600
As fast as you are, you still get "assignments"?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.590
Incredible! You all really
are on a different level.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.270
Look... What are you doing here?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:05.010
I thought if I came here I could see you...
And I wanted to see you, no matter what.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.190
Have I bothered you?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.690
What do you think they're talking about?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.920
Shh!

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.160
This time I'll be perfectly clear.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.360
If you've got no other
business here, don't come again.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.270
Why?! Do you hate me?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.500
It's not a matter of hate or like.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.970
Then why?

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.470
Look, if you come here, it'll be a bother.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.540
Wait! Listen, please!

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.610
I won't get in the way.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.280
I can just watch, right?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.690
I'm fine just being able to watch you race.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:46.150
I swear I won't get in the way,
so please don't hate me so much.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:57.970
I've never felt this way before, not once.
I don't know what else I should do...

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.970
I... I like you.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.810
This is the first time I've
ever liked a man so much.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:13.880
I can't put it very well,
but you're special to me.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.050
Really!

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.820
So... I want to see you, no matter what!

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.190
That's all right, isn't it?

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:27.060
If I come because I just want
to see you... It's okay, right?

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.160
If I come again...

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:44.950
You don't get it at all. What I meant
when I said it'll be a bother.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.020
If you were so terrible, I'd just
ignore you and that'd be the end of it.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.290
But I can't do that, which is
why you'll get in the way.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.570
Do you get it now?
If you're here, you're in the way.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.370
That's all I have to say. Don't come here again.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.220
You all right with this, Keisuke?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.050
Whether I am or not, there's nothing I can do.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.430
Sorry, but I'm going home for the day.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.270
We'll get to the rest tomorrow.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.760
Yeah...

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:04.030
<i>Am I flustered? I don't have time for that now!</i>

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:08.000
<i>But if I let my guard down</i>
<i>even a little, I'll get left behind.</i>

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.440
<i>Takumi has gotten more and</i>
<i>more incredible since joining D.</i>

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.770
<i>I can't go fooling around</i>
<i>with some girl right now...</i>

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.770
<i>Not while he goes racing every day!</i>

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.670
Do you get it now?
If you're here, you're in the way.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.400
That's all I have to say. Don't come here again.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.280
<i>If I really think about it, what my</i>
<i>darling said makes sense, too.</i>

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:35.450
<i>What should I do, I wonder?</i>

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:38.690
<i>Liking someone so much like this...</i>

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.680
<i>It probably only happens once in a lifetime.</i>

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.410
<i>I can't give up.</i>

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.410
<i>I won't get discouraged</i>
<i>over something like this.</i>

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.610
<i>I won't give up!</i>

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.170
Um...

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.000
Nobuhiko! Over here.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.670
Thank you, I found him.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.270
You're late.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.840
Sorry. There was more traffic than I expected.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:37.680
I'll introduce you. This is my cousin Nobuhiko.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.850
Hi.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.680
And this is the guy I told you about, Sakamoto.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.850
'Sup?

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:49.290
I tell you, this guy is fast. He drives
a Ferrari and he's kind of a fanatic.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.960
You won't find a more
perfect driver for our plan.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.470
If Wataru recommends you, I'm sure
there's no doubt. We're counting on you.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.500
Okay, hurry up and let us hear it, Nobuhiko...

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:05.680
The strategy you came up
with to beat the Eight-Six.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.180
All right. We have data on
Project D's expeditions up till now...

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.980
...and the Eight-Six's racing capabilities,
which I observed with my own eyes.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.220
I've performed a cumulative
analysis of both, and as a result,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.390
through process of elimination, I was
able in my own way to derive an answer.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.360
Quit usin' all that complicated talk.
Just say it so it's easy to understand.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.630
Neither one of us here
was born as smart as you.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.230
Agreed. Take it easy on us.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.570
Actually, what I'm trying
to say is extremely simple.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.370
Sakamoto, have you ever driven an FR?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.570
Yeah.

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:44.180
Sakamoto can drive anything. He's driven
FRs the longest. He's really good.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.480
Then we're okay. The fact is,
I brought it. Our ultimate weapon.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.150
"Ultimate weapon"?

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.250
This.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:10.110
Th-This is our ultimate weapon?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.870
Are you being serious, Nobuhiko?

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.750
<i>Hey, the coming of a new generation</i>

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.650

<i>...stares intently at the night</i>
