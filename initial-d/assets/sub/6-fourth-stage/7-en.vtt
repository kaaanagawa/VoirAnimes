He left work early to go get
his Eight-Five from the shop.

And tonight, he's already going to give his
Eight-Five turbo the ol' Akina shakedown.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.450
Well, unfortunately for Itsuki,
simply installing a turbo

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.420
is nowhere near enough
to put him in my league.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.790

She's gotten fast, my Eight-Five!

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.010
You better watch out, Iketani. This could
turn out to be a pretty even match.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.680
Yeah, right. It'll be no contest.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.960

That was a powerslide!

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.970
Whoa! He tore right past
him on the straightaway!

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.720

<i>It can't be... The car from this morning?!</i>

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.990
It's an S15 Silvia!

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.550
<i>Oh, jeez. It's not the same one.</i>

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.330
250 horsepower sure is fast!

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.100
Not that I care anything about that, of course.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.740
It's kinda disappointing, huh?

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.610
Like a rabbit leaping past
two tortoises playing race...

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.610
Who're you calling a tortoise?!

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.350
Ow! That's not enough to go hitting me over!

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:46.970
Kenji!

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.120
A normal 3A-U engine
has 80 gross horsepower,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:00.190
so 150 horses is almost
twice the original output!

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.500
Up till now, I'd never imagined you
could make your rear tires slide

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.800
by going full throttle on the uphill!

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.270
I'm so, <i>so</i> happy that I can't stand it!

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:16.110
I know the feeling. It really is a thrill
after your car's just been tuned, isn't it?

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.050
How was it, Takumi? The Eight-Five
turbo as seen from the passenger seat.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.480
"How"? It was a strange feeling.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.990
Its power output is different
from that of my car.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.960
The 150 horses certainly felt powerful but...

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.130
Maybe it was because of the torque.
The turbo's acceleration

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.670
has more punch than the NA, even though
they both have the same horsepower.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.700
But...

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.840
Having so much horsepower
gives it a stiff underbody.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.070
It feels like the damper isn't working properly.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.140
If you're going to make a car fast,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.380
unless you get the pistons
to stroke a bit more smoothly,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.320
it'll feel like you can't floor
the accelerator when cornering.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.980
You might even go into a drift,
the smallest possible...

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.760
Uh, did I say something strange?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.260
Did you hear that just now?

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.430
I heard it. I'm stunned...

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.170
It could well be just as you said, Takumi.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.330
Itsuki's Eight-Five is a low ride with just
a knockoff damper and spring setup.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.880
You've always been bad with machinery,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.110
so it sure was a surprise to hear such
precise comments coming from your mouth.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.090
You're a completely different
person from before. What a shocker!

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.120
Well, people change with their environment.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.190
You've really come a long way, Takumi.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:42.960
No, if the staff at Project D heard
me talk like that, they'd laugh at...

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.740
It's that guy from before!

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:14.120
Hey, sorry about earlier. If I spot a car
like that one, I just get all happy.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.500
You guys are locals, right?
We came from Tokyo.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.170
There aren't as many cars
racing here as I expected.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.170
Yeah, I thought things would be livelier.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.020
You don't see this every day! An SOHC engine.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.960
This is a so-called "Eight-Five," eh?
And a turbo at that.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.490
Look how uncluttered the engine area is.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.830
In a way, it's like new!

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.930
Look at this. The intercooler's front-mounted!

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.340
Dangerous, man. As in, <i>kaboom.</i>

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.880
I wouldn't wanna ride this thing! Scary...

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.840
Hey, have you guys ever raced a circuit?

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.310
No. There aren't any nearby.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.390
If you all are racers, then you
should be goin', don't you think?

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:17.390
I go to lots of race meets, and I've
run almost all the circuits in Kanto.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.660
My car's tuned a lot stricter than
for just mountain road racing.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.130
Hate to break it to you,

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.000
but I don't think this Eight-Five would
even place in a circuit time ranking.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.800
Wh-What?!

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:34.910
Now look here. What kind of cars
we drive has nothing to do with you.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.580
Put simply, you're being rude.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.080
I don't know how much confidence
you have in your driving techniques,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.650
but if you're simply going to pass cars with
less horsepower on an uphill straightaway,

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.690
that doesn't require any
technique at all, does it?

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.490
What's that supposed to mean?

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:51.890
You're trying to say the downhill is different?

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.430
You can take it to mean anything you like.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.500
But we've had enough, and I wonder
if you'd please hurry up and leave.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.700
Oh, really?

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.920
This doesn't look too good, huh?

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.860
He's just waiting till we start racing, isn't he?

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.400
I'm sure he's planning some
obvious ambush to race us.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.360
This is no joke!

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.900
If he's gonna screw with us like that,
we can't just sit back and take it!

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.640
Yeah! Talking all that stupid talk...
There's no way we'll lose on the downhill!

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.940
That's right. Let's show him the
true power of the Gunma area!

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.450
Yeah!

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.970
Huh? Huh?!

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:55.660
Y-You want me to do it? I can't!
I'm just not up for it today.

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.790
True, we wouldn't want to force
the ace driver of Project D

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.630
to do some boring little race...

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.160
Yeah, I guess not.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.770
All right, <i>I'll</i> do it!

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.240
This isn't like you, Iketani.
Such determination!

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.610
But in return...

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.650
Please. Let me use your insurance!

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.280
Insurance?

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.200
There's no way I'm gonna forgive those guys!

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.670
And after I tried to engage
them in friendly conversation...

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.940
I've gotta teach them a lesson!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.000
Ah! They started racing!

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.300
Okay! We're going, too!

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.020
I don't care if it's the uphill or the downhill,

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:02.860
I've honed my skills at race
meets and on the circuit

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.980
and there's no way I'm gonna lose!

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.200
Hey! Sure enough, he came after us!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.470
I'm feelin' the rush!

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.960
It's been a while since I've raced!

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.180
These local racers are
better than we thought, huh?

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.180
I guess. He's got pretty good
corner entry, this S13.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:37.090
But beating him is gonna be a snap.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.400
I've got confidence in my
driving techniques again!

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.330
I sure was fast, huh?

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.000
I think I was quite cool, too!

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.050
T-T-Takumi! I'm sorry to interrupt,
but do you mind if I ask you something?

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.750
Yeah, okay. What?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.620
Do you think what that fat guy
in the S15 said is true,

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.290
that the Eight-Five turbo is hard to drive?

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.630
I don't know...

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:17.630
It's really different from the car I
always drive, which threw me at first.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.430
It's just a matter of getting used to it, isn't it?

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.630
You should drive the way
that works with the car.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.200
<i>Incredible! This is no kind</i>
<i>of car handling that I know!</i>

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.290
I don't think Iketani will be able to get away.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.320
He has good corner entry at the
parts of the course he's used to,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.230
but watching them from behind,

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.600
his opponent has more stability
when exiting, and good traction, too.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.170
But there wouldn't be that much of a
difference from just racing techniques.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.240
The big difference is in their cars' performance.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.600
A-Are you really Takumi?!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.180
<i>He's grinding the gears too much!</i>
<i>This isn't the same Takumi! Definitely not!</i>

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.280
This is bad. Iketani is going to be passed.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.490
Are you serious?!

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.280
At the straight line just before the corner.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.870
Dammit, it's no good!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.200
Fool! It didn't take long to finish him off.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.540
He can't keep up with me!

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.780
I've got circuit-use full braking!

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.890
A-Awesome, huh?

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.630
A full braking corner entry
taken at maximum speed.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.120
There's definitely no way he could keep--!

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.070
H-He's right behind us!

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.640
He's got some nerve, driving just an S13!
If he thinks he can keep up with me,

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.410
he's sadly mistaken!

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:16.680
I can't keep up...

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.650
Unbelievable. It's just an Eight-Five!

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.350
<i>I thought I'd pulled away, but...</i>

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.040
<i>...he's right up close!</i>

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.220
<i>My braking, honed on the circuit,</i>

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.280
<i>is losing to some racer who's</i>
<i>only done the mountain pass?!</i>

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.960
<i>This is impossible... It can't be!</i>
<i>There's no way this can be happening!</i>

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.740
U-Um, if you look closely, the car
behind us isn't an S13 after--

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.270
Sorry, but...

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:16.740
...can you not talk to me for a
little while? I can't concentrate.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.380
You're gonna do <i>that</i>, huh?

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.240
I am.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.310
I've gotta concentrate 100%!

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:30.460
Not yet.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.830
Not yet... Hold it...

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.970
Now!

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.770
Here we go! Ultimate technique:

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.140
Transcendent Ultra Superlative Braking!

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.790
--Oh, no!
--We're gonna crash!

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.510
Those guys sure got what
they deserved yesterday.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.050
It's a good thing I had him
put me on his insurance...

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.950
That's right!

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:33.290
Anyway, Takumi has been getting
better and better since joining D, huh?

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.020
He's gotten, how can you put it?
Like, at different points,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.990
he'll make the car move in ways
you wouldn't have thought possible.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.630
And that Takumi, his face won't change a bit...

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.670
He just grips the wheel all cool and collected.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.470
He's probably confident
that he's in complete control.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.180
Seeing that, it makes you think

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.310
there's no way you'll ever see
Takumi lose on the downhill, huh?

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:02.040

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.490
I'll take it. I like it.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.390
Well, that's what I said at first,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.030
but I was surprised when I actually drove it.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.000
It really gets me, in a good way.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.330
I'll get all the paperwork
and take it over later. See you.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.580
And then we talk for like
three hours every night,

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.450
so my phone bills are all expensive!

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.780
We're <i>so</i> in love!

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.960
Hey! Are you listening, Kyoko?

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.520
Yes, I'm listening.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.890
I swear, you were thinking
about cars again, right?

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.700
You'll never be able to get
yourself a boyfriend like that.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.870
Until I find someone I really like,
I don't need a boyfriend.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.310
Racing cars is a lot more fun

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.080
than hooking up with some guy
who happens to be available.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.780
So... What kind of person are you after?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.550
Ideally, someone whose ride
is a rotary engine like mine...

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.920
But he definitely has to be faster than me.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.960
And he has to be cool,
even cooler than my lovely FD.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.560
What the heck is that? You're
using a car as your standard?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.900
I believe that one day I'll meet
him for sure... my darling!

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.570
Sorry about this, Keisuke.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:38.910

supposed to be Kenta's job.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.750

Y-Yes, that's right.

We found it in a corner of the
parking lot a little while ago

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500
and turned it in to the guys at the shop there.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.970
U-Um, I...

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.240
I'm sort of clumsy and am always doing this.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.350

can fall out when I open the door.
