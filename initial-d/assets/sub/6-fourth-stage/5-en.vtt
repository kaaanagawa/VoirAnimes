00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.270
Hey, Takumi!

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.640
You have the day off today?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.810
--Yeah.
--Takumi!

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.450
I finally did it!

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.150
Did what?

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.620
The turbo, man, the turbo!

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.050
I told you before, right?! That I was
gonna add a turbo to the Levin!

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.220
Oh...

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.490
It's at the shop right now.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.830
Aah, I can't wait till the day I get it back!

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.830
So Itsuki's Eight-Five will get an upgrade,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.970
going from a slug to a plain old snail, huh?

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.200
What do you think you're saying, Iketani?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.340
I'll have you know they're expecting
it'll go to about 180 horsepower!

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.250
In which case, it could even keep
up with your S13 on the uphill!

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.680
It'll have that much output?
A turbo sure is incredible.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.320
Anyway, Takumi...

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.090
I heard from Kenji. You even beat
those guys from the Toudou School.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.030
Yeah, somehow.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.530
And it seems that Keisuke Takahashi
also won the uphill timed race!

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.770
The Toudou School couldn't do a thing, huh?

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.370
Project D sure is incredible.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.540
I wonder if my Eight-Five turbo will
get me scouted for Project D, too.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.070
Not gonna happen!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.760
Tomo!

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.130
I heard you all lost.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.360
I wanna hear the details.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.430 line:50 %
"Act 5: The Starting Line to Victory"

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.440
Well, I think this incident will
be a good lesson for them.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.410
This kind of motivation is important, too.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.150
As long as you keep racing, you're gonna
run into different kinds of walls.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.490
For both Sakai and Daiki, this was
an encounter with one such wall.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.830
It's only the guys who suffer through it
who can climb that wall and move onward.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.130
When you hit a wall you can't climb,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.100
that's when you've reached
your limits as a driver.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.940
But Tomoyuki...

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.180
You should still be able to climb any
number of the walls you're hitting now.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.680
This is embarrassing.
You could tell, could you, Sir?

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.350
If I couldn't tell that much, I wouldn't
be fit to run the Toudou School.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.320
My "wall" is pretty intense.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.120
I've been made keenly aware that
in racing, having funds is everything.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.530
After losing on the straightaway,
I pushed myself too far,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.340
making stupid mistakes
or getting into trouble.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.770
The team's morale is getting worse

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.280
and with this economy, the sponsors
aren't lining up. The future looks grim.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.480
This may be one wall I'm
powerless against on my own.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.890
I really don't know what I should do.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.820
That's where you're wrong, Tomoyuki.
You've forgotten something very important.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.330
This is a problem I can guarantee lies with <i>you.</i>

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.630
--Don't you get it?
--Sir...

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.370
Why don't you give street racing a try?

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.470
Are you being serious?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.580
You're the one who said not to do anything
stupid out on the street once turning pro!

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.910
Sometimes you hafta be an idiot.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.320
Just think of it like you'll be pullin' a fast
one on those street-racin' amateurs!

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.190
You'll probably find the answer
you're lookin' for now...

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.030 line:50 %

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.000
How is it?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.170
It's got pretty good balance.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.210
I did a light run there and back,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.780
and compared to when the
engine was first changed out,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.880
you can charge downhill and it feels good.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.080
The suspension's a little tricky,
but it's come a long way.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.850
I bet this has made it easier to run races, too.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.020
No, it friggin' hasn't. The guys
we race keep getting better.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.760
I feel like there's no way
I can keep on winning...

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.440
Of course not. It's about time
you try losin' for a change.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.740
You can learn a lot from losin'.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.440
"Try losing"? How can you say it like that?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.710
We're winning these as a <i>team,</i>
so I can't just go losing, now can I?

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.950
Talk all you want, but no one
can perform above his means.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.320
A car's got a basic limit
it can't go faster than, too.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.990
Yeah, but still...

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.760
It'd probably be a load off your mind
if you thought about it that way.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.260
Still, this car...

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.970
I said we could share it, but it feels
like you've completely taken it from me.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.310
It's not even fun for me to work on it anymore.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.580
Maybe I'll buy one, a different one.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.740
A-Are you serious?

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.810
I'll ask Masashi. If a bargain comes up,
I'll have him send it my way.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.980
What do you want to buy? What make?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.320
It's a secret.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.100
Big brother, I'm coming in.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.650
Okay.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.040
You said we got a rematch
challenge from the Toudou School?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.600
From one of its graduates.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.940
--A graduate?
--Yes.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.600

--Is this Ryosuke?
--Yes.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.320
This is Kyoichi Sudou.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.220
Kyoichi? This is a surprise.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.390
You got a rematch challenge from a
graduate of the Toudou School, right?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.730
You'd be better off not accepting it.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:48.070
I know you're not the type of guy to listen
when told not to do something, but listen up.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.370
Your challenger this time is a pro racer!

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.880
His name's Tomoyuki Tachi,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.870
and he's in a league all his own, even
compared to other Toudou School students.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:04.320
Even the mighty Project D can't
be 100% assured of winning.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.750
If there's no way that this
can be avoided... Ryosuke.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.690
You do it!

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:14.390
As long as the course is the street, and as
long as there's even a sliver of a chance,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.490
you need to race this yourself.

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.030
Incredible. The Toudou &amp; Co. demo
cars are fast enough as it is,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.360
but having Tomo behind the steering wheel...

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.470
I got goose bumps just watching.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.240
Just once, I'd like to be in
the passenger seat next to him.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.140
It's like he's in a whole other zone we
could race our entire lives and never reach.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.210
Seeing this, I could care less whether
it's a revenge match against Project D,

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.650
I just definitely have to watch his next race!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.450
An all-out street race with
pro race driver Tomoyuki Tachi...

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.120
There'll never be a second chance to see it!

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.810
How is it?

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.110
Very nice. I have no complaints.

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.350
Any problems down the road will
be because of human emotion...

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.420
Or rather, driver's preference.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.760
I'll make it fit <i>your</i> preference.
What do you want?

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.990
Really? But...

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.430
...is it necessary to go that far

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.030
when the car already has such
incredible racing capabilities?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.800
Even though you said the
challengers are amateurs...

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.600
It may be just a street race,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.540
but if you don't give your all,
there's no point in doin' it.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.870
Listen, Tomoyuki...

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.610
Don't think about needless details,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.380
and just treat this as if it were a real race.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.940
Show me the best job
you're capable of right now.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.120
Understood. If you're going
to be that adamant about it,

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.190
I have a small request to
make about the underbody.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:32.030
Please retune it so that the rear comes
out a little more when entering corners.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.500
The way I drive now,
that will trim my race time.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.130
Okay, understood. No problem.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.320
It sure does give off a different
impression, doesn't it?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.050
Just with one new hood...

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:59.230
Based on Ryosuke's advice, I've tried
to make the Eight-Six more lightweight.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.430
Going forward, we plan to try
several such small modifications.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.700
Everyone, gather round.
The meeting will now begin.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.210
This is footage of the race
course shot just today.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.340
If you watch this, I think you'll understand.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.450
This particular stage is a mix,
half uphill and half downhill.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.090
In that case, who runs it, me or Fujiwara?

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.020
We will decide that once we reach the course.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.260
Both cars will do a practice run, and I will
review the results to make my decision.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:39.530
<i>What the hell? It's gonna be me,</i>
<i>of course! I'm the ace driver!</i>

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:47.770
This is important, so I'll say it up front:
our opponent is from the Toudou School.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.440
What's more, he's an established pro racer.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.550
A pro?! No way!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.890
No matter how you look at it,
this is a bad idea, Ryosuke.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.290
Our guys will run right into his traps!

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.230
That's right! This is playing dirty!

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.990
There will be no way of knowing
unless we challenge him.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.970
I've thought it over,
and decided that we shall do it.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.670
We shall never run away from any opponent.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.740
That is the motto of Project D!

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.810
Let me do it, brother.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.410
If the stage is a mix of uphill and downhill,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.820
then with its level of power, the FD should
have the advantage over the Eight-Six.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.820
That's right!

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.180
Keisuke. Do not make me
say the same thing twice.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:39.190
As I said, I will decide who races
once we arrive at the course!

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.270
Tomo.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.980
Ah. Daiki.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.010
Project D will start their practice runs tonight.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.650
What will you do? Would you
like to go take a look later?

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.390
They'll be racing till close to dawn,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.220
tuning their cars while running the course--

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.660
It's like they're playing racecar.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:17.230
They're doing the same thing we
normally do when racing a circuit, eh?

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:23.800
To be honest, I don't really
know what Mr. Toudou is thinking.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.210
I think he knows I'm stressed

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.640
and is probably trying to give
me a chance to snap out of it.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:36.820
The thing is, there's no reason for me
to look forward to some street race.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:42.490
I'm only doing this because I
think it's best to do what he says.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.560
And since I've decided to do it, I won't pull
any punches, even against an amateur.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.200
You all just watch closely and see
how big a difference there is

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.570
between pros and amateurs!

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.680
This is a tough course that
incorporates all different types.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.120
Cars' condition, drivers' techniques...

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.760
This course will require the best of both.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.630
As always, run five races at 80%.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.900
This is not the Toudou School's course,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.370
but they should already
have raced it before us.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.530
Concentrate, and head out!

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.220
Keisuke certainly is taking this seriously.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.720
Yes, he is.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.390
I say we take our time with it.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.590
I don't know whether we'll race or not,

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.060
but we should at least
get everything done right.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.400
--Okay.
--As always...

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.300
...our real enemy is the course.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.960
Here I go.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.240
Ryosuke...

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.910
This isn't like you, heading out
alone to scout out the course.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.680
What's more, taking the FC with you...

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.080
There is no special meaning in
my having brought my own car.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.120
The important thing was simply to grab
the steering wheel and know the course.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.690
--However, it...
--What is it?

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.000
On the contrary, it has
made me more confused.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.870
Fumihiro, you give the orders in my stead.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.540
The same routine as always,
so there should be no problems.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.310
What?! And what are you going to do?

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.040
Sleep.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.810
H-Hey!

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.550
I've been absorbed with
a clinical pathology report

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.880
and have just remembered I've worked
until the early hours for three days now.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.220
I thought my head was
operating rather sluggishly.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.980
Do not wake me.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.740
<i>I get it.</i>

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.210
<i>Not only are there steep ups and downs,</i>

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.050
<i>there are so many variables to this</i>
<i>course that it's hard to keep balanced.</i>

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.490
<i>I guess that's what my brother meant</i>
<i>when he said this was a tough course.</i>

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.200
<i>I wonder how my skills will</i>
<i>stack up against a pro racer.</i>

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.690
<i>This is my best chance to test it out!</i>

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.110
How on earth is this going to turn out?

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.940
I'm really worried about this...

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.610
There it is again.
That old Fumihiro anxiousness.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.290
That's not it. This time,
something is really strange.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.790
And I've known him for a long time.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.460
But...

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.560
He would never use the Eight-Six
on this course, would he?

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.020
Yeah. That's what I'm thinking.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.400
<i>What are you planning, Ryosuke?</i>

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.240
<i>No... It couldn't be!</i>

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.170
It's finished.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.130
All done, Keisuke.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.900
Okay.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.320 line:50 %
"Italian Fair"

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.990
My back hurts!

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.860
You can't get a good night's
sleep in a car, can you?

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.700
Ryosuke's pretty incredible
about that, isn't he?

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.130
He can sleep soundly and not wake up at all!

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.000
Our great leader...

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.610
That's nothing to make fun of, Matsumoto!

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:34.210
I swear! Only just yesterday, he let
us know just how important he is.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:40.490
An organization can't perform
smoothly if its "brain" isn't functioning.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.060
Our spirits are low and
we're operating disjointedly.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.630
And he should know it.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.330
No matter how you look at it,
this time around, it's strange.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.070
What do you mean?

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:57.300
This is just between you and me, Matsumoto.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:02.580
I think Ryosuke can't come up with
a simulation that will let us win.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:09.640
After exploring any and all possibilities,
if he still can't find a way we can win...

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.930
That's Ryosuke for you.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.260
Configuring the cars should
have taken till morning,

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.930
but Ryosuke was somehow able
to do it last night in two hours.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.740
I wondered what was going on
for a while there, but...

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.900
Ryosuke sure is incredible!

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.700
They're here! The Toudou School!

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.590
Bring me a flashlight!

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.120
And a jack!

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.230
Looks like the boss man
finally showed his face.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.070
I immediately knew which
one was today's driver!

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.800
Me, too.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.740
He's different, isn't he?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.480
Keisuke, Fujiwara. Come here a moment.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.280
After reviewing yesterday's data,
I've made my decision.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.990
Today, the Eight-Six will ride.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.390
You, Fujiwara.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.560
Hold on a minute, brother!

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.270
I had a better time in the practice runs!

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:36.140
I know that.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.640
Then unless you explain, I can't
accept it. Why the Eight-Six?!

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.250
I will explain later. There's
something I must do now, quickly.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.680
Fujiwara.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.640
Get in my car's passenger seat.
I shall lecture you as we ride.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.700
<i>Brother... this isn't right!</i>

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.600
Keisuke, don't let it get to you.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.010
What Ryosuke does,
he does for an important reason.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.180
--I know that!
--Keisuke!

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.310
And knowing that just
makes it more disgraceful!

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.310
A-Awesome!

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.680
Just once, I'd like to wear something like that!

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.490
Idiot. These are like battle fatigues.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.020
Once you put these on, playtime is over.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.090
You <i>fight</i>, with the pride of a professional.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.360
Tomo.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.400
Even one of our demo cars

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.830
will lose to an FD on a straightaway.
Don't let your guard down.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:19.210
I already have a counter-strategy in mind.
That's why I had the car tuned to my specs.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:22.570
Just leave the rest to me.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.130
Are the Eight-Six's preparations complete?

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.230
It's already done warming up.
It's good to go anytime.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.900
Very well, let's start. Fumihiro.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.390
Got it.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.640
All right, let's begin.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.880
There's plenty of road width,
so we'd like to start

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.410
with a simultaneous, side-by-side dash.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.150
Fine. I leave it all up to you.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:08.710
Understood. Okay, line up your cars!

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.830
Hey, what the hell? For real, the Eight-Six?!

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.610
Didn't see this one coming, eh?

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.820
What's the meaning of this?

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.840
They don't disappoint,
those guys from Gunma.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:47.860
We were 100% sure they'd come with the FD,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.930
meaning they've avoided all our preparations.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.990
To think they'd use some
underpowered Eight-Six...

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.800
This is quite the insult to us, and to Tomoyuki.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.140
Still, that makes it all the more interesting.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.240
All right! Starting the countdown!

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.090
Five! Four! Three!

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.090
Two! One!

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.690
Go!

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.770
All right! His front section's
pulled halfway ahead!

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.540
Which will it be?

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.340
Which one will enter the corner first?!

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.750
<i>Hey, the coming of a new generation</i>

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.650
<i>Calling now for the arrival of a new era</i>

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:56.790
<i>How long are you going to</i>
<i>pretend you've forgotten?</i>

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.890
<i>(Tension that seems like it'll</i>
<i>rip my heart) This heartache...</i>

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.900
<i>Within those eyes,</i>
<i>something that can't be held back...</i>

<i>(Yeah, this image that won't let me go)</i>
<i>...stares intently at the night</i>

<i>Yes, the two who didn't even know how</i>

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:27.120
<i>to reach out and touch someone's</i>

<i>Check it, This will blast your love)</i>

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:36.600

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.770
<i>Blast my desire, stronger than fire</i>

<i>A risky tune that rocks the times</i>
