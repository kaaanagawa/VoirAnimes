I get it now, Nobuhiko.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.970
Sure enough, in a sense this car
could be a monster machine.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.680
Even just taking it out for a
light spin, it got this kind of time.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.150
That's why I said this was about
something extremely simple.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.680
Weight, huh?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.150
Yes. One weapon that no opponent
has yet used is to be lightweight.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.390
On the downhill stage,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.090
being lightweight is the ultimate
weapon that breaks all rules.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.760
If we use that as our counterstrike,
and on a difficult course

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.560
specific to the Saitama area...

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.930
...we will be able to beat
Project D's Eight-Six...

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.100
...with our Cappuccino minicar!

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.180
In any case, that's a Ferrari racer for you.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.010
Personally, while I'm not entirely opposed,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.620
I don't much care for taking a car
sideways during corner entry.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.790
That car has a shorter wheelbase,
allowing it to enter spin mode faster.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.790
I told you, didn't I? He's a fanatic.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.060
No matter what kind of car
or how narrow the road,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.800
he'll always take it out sideways.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.600
Doing that, he can pin down a
car's quirks as well as its limits.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.600
He's a lot like Akina's Eight-Six,
that same fanaticism.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.310
I'm really looking forward to this.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.210
The time has finally come to put a stop

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.610
to the mighty Eight-Six's consecutive wins.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.420
Come anytime, Project D.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.260

united Saitama-Northwest Area team!

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.110
Ya know,

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.020
I've noticed that something
about this car is always different.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.690
And a lot of work's been put
into it in ways ya can't see, right?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.320
Yeah, I guess.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.920
Even the headlights have been
changed out for lighter ones. Somehow.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.300
If taken to this extreme, even a
kid's game stops bein' a game, huh?

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.800
Say, Takumi.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.040
I'm givin' ya the Eight-Six.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.810
You're a workin' man now. Sharin' the car
fifty-fifty has gotta be inconvenient.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.980
I guess... But are you being serious?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.880
What, you're not happy?

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.680
For myself, yeah. But what will you do?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.360
I've already decided to buy
another car. A used one.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.720
What kind of car?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.330
One that's practical and
easy to drive. I'm gettin' old.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.500
Practical and easy to drive?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.970
<i>That doesn't sound like something he'd say...</i>

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.170
You take care of changin' it into your name.
And startin' next year, you pay taxes on it.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.710
--Okay.
--Of course...

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.580
That's assumin' the car
is still runnin' next year.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.750
Of course it'll still be running.
Don't say weird stuff like that.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.220
I really like this car. I want
to keep driving it forever.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.590
That's all fine and good. Just make
sure you handle things properly.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.600
The course we'll be scouting
today is supposedly narrow

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.880
and intersected by
occasional drainage ditches.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.050
--Ah.
--Well, courses in Saitama prefecture

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.050
are apparently the same everywhere.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.880
--Yeah.
--By the way, Keisuke...

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.350
This may come across as
needless meddling, but...

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.090
What?

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.230
I thought she was a pretty
decent lady. That girl. She's cute.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.130
And coming all the way to Akagi...
That was touching, don't you think?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.970
What is it you don't like about her?

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.200
Nothing, really.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.370
It's not a matter of like or dislike.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.440
Like I told her, I just want
to concentrate only on D.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.050
I've always thought this, but...

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.110
Keisuke, I think your way of thinking
is too focused. Or rather, too linear.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.920
It's like driving techniques, right?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.390
Instead of always just flooring the gas,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.760
being brave enough to
take your foot off the pedal

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.160
can sometimes lead to increased speed.

"Reduce Speed"

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.600
Still, me trying to tell you
about driving techniques

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.130
sounds incredibly pompous, huh?

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.820
In any case, you don't have to stoically
push yourself to such extremes, do you?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.290
Dating a girl could probably be a plus.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.350
The truth is, you like that girl, don't you?

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.000
With that girl, things wouldn't turn out
like with your last girlfriend, right?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.200
After all, she races too.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.670
That's not the point. You just don't get it.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.660
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.950
A union of the Saitama and Northwest areas?

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.220
Yeah. Project D operates so
much like an organization

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.230
that we're no match for
them if we act individually.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.160
The only way we can fight them is
through our network of associates, right?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:50.000
That's why Nobuhiko and the others joined
together to form a temporary team.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.870
Is that so?

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.710
And the thing is, they need money,
so everyone's pitching in a little.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.680
Kyoko, can you give some too?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.550
If that's what it takes...
Will 5,000 yen be enough?

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.020
Kyoko. Got a minute?

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.000
--Are you all right with this?
--With what?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.060
The collection to defeat Project D.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.040
With things coming to this, I'm going to
ask you straight up, whose side are you on?

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.910
In terms of feelings.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.380
Whose side?

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.380
If you feel kind of on the fence about it,
it's okay if you don't pitch in.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.520
Nobuhiko and the others are
serious about beating Project D.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.960
If you're not in it 100%,
you don't have to participate.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.290
I'm not saying this trying to be mean.
You know what I'm talking about, right?

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.030
Hey Kyoko, did you know?

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.800
The Takahashi brothers of Project D

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.310
are the sons of someone
who runs a huge hospital.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.110
Really? I didn't know that.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.280
They're good-looking and have money to boot.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.320
You should think twice about that sort of guy.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.980
So I'm just trash?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.090
No, that's not what I'm saying.
But they're popular with the ladies.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.330
Even if you go chasing after a guy
like that, all you're going to get is hurt.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.770
I'm saying this for your own good.
You should snap out of this, and soon.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.170
<i>No, I can't accept that.</i>

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.140
<i>My darling is the only one for me!</i>

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.110
Coming along nicely, huh?

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.610
Call it against the rules or whatever
you like, but I want to beat Project D...

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.010
And this is the only way to do it.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.500
A change of title? For the Eight-Six?

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.200
So what's your dad gonna do?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.030
He'll buy something else.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.170
Whoa... Like what?

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:42.510
He didn't say specifically, but he said
it'll be practical and easy to drive,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.710
so maybe an automatic van or a minivan.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.210
Are you serious?! There goes his image.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.490
The man called the "legendary racer of Akina"
driving an automatic van or minivan...

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.720
Where's the harm? He is getting old and all.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.160
It'd be nice if he got some old-man
car and just settled down.

Well...

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.740
I'm going to be late for the
rendezvous, so I'd better get going.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.170
Okay. Break a leg, Takumi!

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:20.340
I'll be going with Iketani and the
others to cheer you on tomorrow!

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.570
Say, Fumihiro.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.070
This latest expedition could turn
out to be the greatest challenge

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.310
Fujiwara has yet faced.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:53.310
Fujiwara? But all his races are tough,
one right after the other.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.920
That time he raced the Toudou School,
he went up against a pro racer.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.590
This could turn out to be even more difficult.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.490
Someone more difficult than a pro racer?!

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.160
His greatest enemy does not
necessarily have to be the driver.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.400
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.230
You'll understand soon enough.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.470
I'm going to sleep now. Don't wake
me until we reach our destination.

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.900
Okay. Understood.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.470
<i>His "greatest challenge"?</i>

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.940
<i>Just what is that supposed to mean?</i>

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.250
They're here.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.630
Hey! We've been waiting for you. Eagerly.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.770
You remember me, right?

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.380
Yes, I remember you.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.850
This time it won't be me you're up against,
but I'm still looking forward to your race.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:03.650
Huh? You!

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.450
Forgive this old foe for coming
back under a new guise,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.050
but this time I'll be
participating from the sidelines.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.160
In any case, we'll open up the course now,
so race it as much as you like.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.460
All right.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.390
See you.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:25.070
There's a moisture to this wind.
There appears to be a 50% chance of rain.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.810
Can't say I'm too thrilled about the rain.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.840
So long as you etch the details of the course
into memory, there will be no problem.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.480
Concentrate. Your goal is
to make 50 runs by morning.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.180
All right.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.210
Okay.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.660
Standby prep complete. We're good, Keisuke.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.680
Okay, let's go.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.020
<i>She's not here, eh?</i>

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.670
<i>I wonder if Project D</i>
<i>has started racing by now.</i>

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.670
<i>I want to race right over there,</i>
<i>but I feel discouraged somehow.</i>

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:11.310
<i>I'm like the bat in that</i>
<i>Aesop's fable I read as a kid...</i>

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:15.180
<i>Like I'm the only one without any friends.</i>

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.090
I wonder if it'll rain come tomorrow...

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.160
Probably. Rain would be welcome.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.930
It would make the perfect
curves for Sakamoto.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.130
The worse that conditions get,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.970
the more effective our weapon,
lightness, will become.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:42.440
But if the rain gets too bad,
we'll have to cancel the race, right?

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:48.650
I doubt it. All four cars are FRs, which
means they're on equal footing. Also...

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.880
These aren't the kind of opponents
who'd run away over something like rain.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.850
We couldn't ask for a more
perfect turn of events.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.890
If there is such a thing as fate, that
which could sway the course of a race...

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.350
...then without a doubt,
it has turned in our favor!

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.980
Gas it up. Ten liters will do.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.750
Okay.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.190
Keisuke.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.390
Once you're comfortable, race the latter
half of the course with your headlights off,

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.660
fog lights only.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.260
If it rains, visibility will worsen.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.230
This will be training to rely
not just on your eyes,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.530
but on your mental image of the course.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.700
A rain strategy, huh? Okay, I'll give it a try.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.260
<i>Sure enough, I worried about my darling...</i>

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.750
<i>My darling's FD?</i>

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.270 line:50 %
"Keep Out"

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.480
<i>I want to touch it!</i>

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:57.840
H-He showed up!

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.610 line:50 %
"Protected Forest"

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.510
What do you mean I "showed up"?
That would be <i>you</i>!

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.920
You scared me! I thought
my heart was gonna stop.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.650
What are you doing out here?

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:13.860
Well, I was taking a nap.
The race is tonight, you know.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:18.600
Th-That's right. Um, good luck!

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.700
I need to sleep for tonight, but...

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.370
Once I wake up, I can't go back to sleep.
On top of that, now I'm hungry.

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.270
Are you free right now?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.450
Um...

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.050
Do you come to places like this often?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.330
"Places like this"?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.960
Casual dining restaurants and stuff.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.060
Yeah. All the time!

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.970
It's one of the basics, right? Street
racers go to casual dining restaurants!

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.040
Y-Yeah, you're right!

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:04.810
<i>His family may own a big hospital, but he's</i>
<i>like a down-to-earth prince. What a relief!</i>

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.180
Huh? Keisuke's not here.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.820
I wonder where he's gone.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.150
Maybe he went to get something to eat.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.520
On foot?

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.590
Nothing we can do now.
Shall we go ahead and eat?

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.890
Yeah, might as well.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:30.740
If the weather stays nice, it kinda puts
you in the mood for a little hiking, huh?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.740
--Hey, pass me a tea.
--Here.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.410
Thank you.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.540
--Could you sleep?
--Two or three hours, I think.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.250
It'd be best if you get some
rest after you're done eating.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.550
Even if you don't sleep, closing your eyes
and resting will take away the tiredness.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.690
Okay.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:52.860
But I want to get in two
or three races if it rains.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.360
I'd like to check which areas collect puddles
and whatnot while it's still daylight.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.530
Yeah...

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.700
Sure enough, it looks like
it could rain right now,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.030
even though it hasn't gotten around to it yet.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.240
Do you always sleep in your car
when you're out for Project D?

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.080
For the most part, yeah.
But we don't get much rest.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.050
Bucket seats are terrible for sleeping in.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.990
That sounds rough. Why not stay at
a bed-and-breakfast or something?

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.060
We race until morning and
then sleep once it gets light.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.630
There aren't any bed-and-breakfasts
that'd give us a room then.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.600
Oh. I guess you're right.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.070
Now that I'm full, I've gotten kinda sleepy.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.840 line:50 %
"Open 24 Hours"

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.000
What do you say we head back?

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.010
It's started raining.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.450
<i>What should I do? My darling fell asleep!</i>

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.920
<i>Poor man. I'll make sure not</i>
<i>to wake him. Slowly, slowly...</i>

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.450
<i>I wish time would stop for this moment.</i>

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.950
<i>Please God, make time stop for this moment!</i>

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.070
Not good. It's really gotten wet.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.570
Nothing for it but to prepare
for the worst and head out, eh?

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.550
You can't race in rain like this.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.520
You're crazy, brother,
and so are the rest of you.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.420
Doesn't look like it's gonna let up, does it?

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.190
Nope. Looks like it's going to
keep raining like this all night.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.430
There's no way they'd cancel the race, right?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.830
I certainly doubt it.
Let's get ready to head out.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.390
Yessir!

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.580
Huh? Oh, no!

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.620
I totally fell asleep!

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.420
What time is it?

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.730
Um... It's 6:00.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:47.360
I was out for so long. But I've never slept
this soundly on any of our previous races!

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.400
Are you all right? We've spent
half the day out here.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.740
I'm sorry. You probably had
things of your own to do.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:00.110
No, I'm fine! Don't even worry about that!

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:03.550
I didn't have any errands or anything, so...

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.410
Thank you.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.480
Okay, I have to go.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.720
This is bad. I still have to
finalize the car's settings!

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.660
Thank you!

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.180
Ah! Here they come!

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.630
A Cappuccino?!

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.310
Ryosuke, more and more I've come
to understand what you said...

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:09.180
That this race would be
Fujiwara's greatest challenge.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.190
They got us. They completely
caught us off-guard.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.460
They have someone, too...

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.360
Someone with brains.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.620
Here we go!

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.870
Starting in five seconds.

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.340
Four... Three...

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.710
Two... One...

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.340
Go!

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.040
