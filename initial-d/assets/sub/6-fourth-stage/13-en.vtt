Being a full-time worker
has changed you somehow.

Uh, I don't think I've changed a bit.

I think you're the one who's
more grown-up, Kazumi.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.920
By the way, I got my license.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.760
Oh, you did? What, automatic only?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.860
No, manual. I can even drive
my brother's Levin if I want.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.470
I don't like it so much, though.
He'll let me drive it sometimes,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.100
but the steering wheel's heavy
and it's a lot of work.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.940
Won't you buy a car?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.610
I used all my money for driving school,
so not anytime soon.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.810
I guess I'll just work hard till I've
saved enough for a down payment.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.850
Oh, hey! I installed a turbo in
my Eight-Five! It's so fast now!

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.950
One day soon, I'm gonna go up against Iketani!

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.790
Wow, so you're a real racer now.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.490
Well, I guess! If you like,
I'll take you for a drive sometime!

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.890
What do you think? Seems like
a pretty even match, huh?

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.160
It's not as if you can go opening
it full throttle in this rain.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.320
The lower the speed range,
the more the FD loses its advantage.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.610
Ah. Thank you.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.510
They're just before the road cut hairpins.
It looks like it's a dead heat.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.050
He's not just gonna let us win. That FD is fast.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.620
At any rate, keeping up with Wataru's
Levin in this rain is no easy task.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:07.300
As I thought during the race with Kyoko,
this guy's accelerator handling is superb.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.300
At this rate, he might be able to keep up...

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.130
Yes. But the longer this gets drawn out,
the more Wataru has the advantage.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.620
About that, the other guy
had the same turbo S13 180!

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.320
Why would you use that in a race?!

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.150
What the hell's with Itsuki?

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.990
He blows us off to have a good
time over there by himself!

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.590
Do something, Takumi!

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.500
Uh, well, there's not much I can...

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.130
Just look at those leering faces!
What are those two talking about?!

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.140
I didn't know Wataru would be
here until I'd arrived, either.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.140
What's more, Kazumi showing up
when Itsuki of all guys has to be here...

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.080
Sure is a coincidence, huh?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.450
It's like a soap opera or something!

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.260
<i>If only Itsuki gets a happy ending,</i>
<i>I won't have a leg to stand on!</i>

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.460
<i>Dammit! Come on Mako, show up!</i>

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.020
<i>No chance of that happening...</i>

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.940
There's something I'd like to
talk to you about. You mind?

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.450
<i>He's done a good job of keeping up.</i>
<i>I should know, having originally had a turbo.</i>

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.520
<i>Driving a high-powered turbo</i>
<i>on wet roads is hard!</i>

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.390
<i>He may be my enemy,</i>
<i>but that bastard's got great skill.</i>

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.200
There's just one thing I want to ask.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.470
Is it about what happened
just before the goal?

00:07:53.470 --> 00:08:01.510
No, not that. See, I'm a Ferrari driver.
We're not good at playing chase, like...

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.550
The whole tactical thing,
passing and being passed...

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.980
I'm really not interested in that.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:14.480
What I want to know is, simply, where does
your strong sense of motivation come from?

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.230
I felt it clearly in the middle of our race.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.740
You've got really strong emotions.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.770
At the very least, when it comes to car
performance, mine should have an advantage.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.040
And I don't think there's that much
difference in our driving techniques...

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360
It's strange.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.430
Even though I'm saying this,
you just seem like a regular guy.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.870
But that intense motivation of yours
even shrugs off rain like it's nothing...

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.890
Just where does it come from?

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.650
Anyone who says he's not afraid
of the rain is a rank amateur.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.460
Driving in the rain wears away at your nerves.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.390
Sustaining your concentration
for a long period of time

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:32.070
takes extraordinary willpower and stamina.
I think that's what motivation is.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.800
That's what I meant when I said
you've got strong emotions.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.440
Talking from my own experience,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.680
that degree of emotional strength isn't
possible without a strong sense of purpose.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.280
Your driving is sort of like a pro's.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.580
Like a pro's? It is?

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.030
Beginning the second round!

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.800
Starting in five seconds!

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.970
Four... Three...

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.670
--Two... One...
--The second round, let's do this!

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.660
--Yeah!
--Go!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.650
I'm a bit apprehensive about the second race.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.520
After all, he's up against that FD.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.650
You think Wataru will be all right?

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.520
He'll stick with him, no matter what.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.190
The roads in this area are like his home course.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:01.220
<i>This guy's good. This rain can't be very</i>
<i>pleasant for a high-powered rotary turbo.</i>

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.820
<i>On wet roads, having as much power as an FD</i>

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.760
<i>means not being able to accelerate normally.</i>

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.660
<i>It takes ultra-precise half-throttle acceleration.</i>

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.170
<i>But there are no faults in my strategy!</i>

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.600
<i>If this becomes a war of attrition,</i>

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.370
<i>the car that's harder to control</i>
<i>will cause its driver to slip up.</i>

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.540
<i>Once your concentration is broken,</i>
<i>that's when you make mistakes...</i>

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.740
<i>That's what will decide this race!</i>

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.720
You say that, but I still don't really understand.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.250
I always feel that I want to get better.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:38.860
I think the other members of Project D
are much more "like a pro" than me.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.430
In any case, I just race as hard as I can
and try not to drag them down.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.700
Is that so? Then it's probably your environment.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.370
How old are you?

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.710
Nineteen.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:57.110
Nineteen?! I'll be 26 this year.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:05.920
If I'd had your technique when I was 19,
I think my life would've been a lot different.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.260
I'm jealous of you.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.660
If I'd just put in the extra effort,

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.060
I'd be in an environment where
I could race as fast as I like.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.600
I've been in something of a slump recently...

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.440
I wanted to ask you in case I could
pick up any hints. Sorry to bother you.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.750
<i>Motivation, huh? I've come this far</i>
<i>without really giving it much thought.</i>

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.490
<i>Just being in Project D</i>
<i>gets me naturally motivated.</i>

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.860
<i>I think I've found myself in an</i>
<i>incredibly blessed environment.</i>

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.000
<i>Also, I love this car!</i>

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.930
<i>So... my strongest emotion is not wanting</i>
<i>to lose to Keisuke, my own teammate!</i>

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.530
<i>He's keeping up with me after all, eh?</i>

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.030
<i>It's to be expected.</i>

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:29.130
<i>With MUs this low, I can only</i>
<i>run my engine at half strength.</i>

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.980
<i>My FD isn't in its element</i>
<i>unless it's in a high-speed race.</i>

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.210
<i>The old me probably would've blown his top,</i>

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.490
<i>but that accelerator training I've been</i>
<i>doing recently is coming in handy.</i>

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.660
<i>Anyway, I have to wait it out.</i>
<i>My chance will definitely come!</i>

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.490
<i>If he could win, then I can definitely win, too!</i>

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.370
This race has gotten deadlocked, huh?

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.840
Having to draw it out longer
works against Keisuke.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.440
In these rainy conditions, he should have
no anxiety regarding the car's mechanics...

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.010
So all the pressure falls onto the driver, huh?

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:15.050
It's his nerves that get worn down.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:17.790
I wonder how long Keisuke
can sustain his concentration.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.620
You seem like you enjoy it. Tormenting Keisuke.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.120
That's not it.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.260
He'll never get a better chance than this

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.200
to fully master the task he's been undertaking.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.460
I'll have him race long and leisurely.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.200
Yeah, you've got a point...

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.540
Techniques that do not come alive during
actual, pressure-filled races are meaningless.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:41.480
Meaning Keisuke's got it tough, as usual.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.380
<i>That bastard's still right on my tail.</i>

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.120
<i>A supercharger, huh? That was clever.</i>

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.430
<i>Even though we have the same setup that</i>
<i>uses air pressure to drive our turbines,</i>

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:04.500
<i>his also gets power supplied</i>
<i>directly from the crankshaft.</i>

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:11.570
<i>My system's greatest merit is that it gets power</i>
<i>directly proportional to increased RPMs.</i>

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:17.240
<i>With a turbocharger there's a differential,</i>
<i>or turbo lag, but not with this setup.</i>

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.680
<i>Even though a turbo gives you</i>
<i>more of an increase in power,</i>

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:26.780
<i>with this, you just step on the gas to get</i>
<i>regulated power, regardless of conditions!</i>

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.930
<i>If you're out on winding roads</i>
<i>with low average speed,</i>

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.660
<i>a supercharger will definitely give you</i>
<i>more fighting advantage than a turbo!</i>

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.220
Incredible! They're going out
for a third race, huh?

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.190
Neither of them can seem to clinch it.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.390
I guess that means their
skills are evenly matched.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.530
It's because of the rain.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.530
--Starting in five seconds! Four! Three! Two!
--It makes the rear car keep pace with the lead.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.470
--One! Go!
--If they raced separately you'd
see a difference in their times,

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:20.310
but with these rules, sometimes the cars
just pull each other along like magnets.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.340
I bet the two of them are tired by now, huh?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.650
I'm sure they are,
but they're still concentrating.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.320
Once you've realized you're tired,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.250
you've already started to lose your
concentration, and that's dangerous.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.880
It's why the moment that decides
the race is disappointingly short.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.530
<i>Dammit! I'm not gonna lose!</i>

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.240
<i>Now that it's come down to this,</i>
<i>it's a battle of motivation!</i>

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.070
<i>Some rich kid who doesn't worry</i>
<i>about money wouldn't understand,</i>

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.040
<i>but there's a drive and</i>
<i>willpower that money can't buy!</i>

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.280
<i>And havin' me win would make</i>
<i>things that much more dramatic!</i>

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.360
This has turned into a
pretty incredible race, huh?

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.260
It sure has. They just keep racing in the
middle of this rain without any breaks.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.360
I think Wataru is totally incredible!

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.900
Even on the hillclimb,
he doesn't lose an inch to the FD!

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.240
As someone who drives a
Levin too, I really admire him!

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.610
Admire him? My brother?

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.280
--Yeah!
--You shouldn't.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.250
What's so great about him, anyway?

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.080
"What"? Well, everything!
He's cool, he's serious about cars...

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.460
The way he insisted on a Levin instead
of some new car is totally macho!

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.720
No, it's just that he doesn't have any money!

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.160
He's got no money, huh? Hey, neither do I!

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.930
<i>I'm jealous... They're having a great time!</i>

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.610
<i>The Levin's movements have</i>
<i>started to become a little weird.</i>

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.420
<i>He must be tired, too. Maybe</i>
<i>it's time I try moving into action.</i>

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.580
<i>I'm gonna put as much</i>
<i>pressure on him as I can!</i>

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.460
<i>Dammit! He's trying to ramp up the</i>
<i>pressure, huh? I'm not falling for it!</i>

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.830
<i>I can't be the only one suffering through this.</i>

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.130
<i>Let's see who can last longer!</i>

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:53.060
You finally showed up, huh? Hiding in
a corner somewhere doesn't suit you.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.230
You came to support
Keisuke Takahashi, didn't you?

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.970
I'm sorry, Nobuhiko.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:04.170
Don't worry about that. It's not
as if we're at war or anything.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.700
Feel free to go ahead and
support whoever you like.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.690
Being in the rain's got him
wobbling around that much, huh?

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.990
FRs sure are pieces of junk.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.160
If I wanted to beat him,
I could do it any time I wanted.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.860
Not that it would be a fair fight...

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.950
<i>I feel like he's really on my tail.</i>

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.520
<i>I wonder why... If it's because I'm tired</i>
<i>and my pace has dropped, that's bad.</i>

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.580
<i>I've gotta really floor it!</i>

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.270
<i>This is bad. It's getting to</i>
<i>where I can't control it.</i>

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.100
<i>Does this mean I've almost</i>
<i>lost my ability to concentrate?</i>

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.410
Humans can't sustain intense
concentration for long.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.740
When pushed to the very limit,
about 30 minutes is the maximum.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:18.980
Yeah, but...

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:24.080
Pro racers have to keep going
for two to three hours, right?

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.620
It may be a race, but it's not
as if they're going at 100%.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.430
On the circuit, there are long
straightaways where one can relax.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:38.770
So in that sense, there's no place
to relax on a winding public road.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.440
In the rain, there is little visibility
and the road is slippery.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.400
You can't let your guard down for a second.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.010
What exactly happens when
your concentration is broken?

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.410
First, your concentration becomes dulled.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:53.450
Your reflexes slow.
The smallest things cause stress.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.280
You become unable to do two things at once.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.080
When the end comes, it is disappointingly fast.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.490
<i>Good luck, my darling. Don't let him beat you!</i>

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.520
<i>I'll always be here for you, darling!</i>

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.880
The rain's suddenly picked up.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.180
It's really coming down now!

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.830
<i>I can't see!</i>

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.670
<i>There should be a mid-speed section</i>
<i>up ahead that veers sharply to the left.</i>

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.450
Dammit!

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.140
You all right?

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.210
Yeah. I stopped just short of the concrete wall.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.640
Ah. You spun out on a good angle there.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.320
One of my talents. This may
sound like an excuse, but...

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:17.460
I know where all the gutters on this course are,
and I can tell you how many there are.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.660
But for just a second, I got distracted
by the switch for the windshield wiper

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.630
and that gutter spun me right out. All I
can say is, I just wasn't thinking straight.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.670
Even I still can't believe it.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:36.010
I guess that's what it is...
to have your concentration broken.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.350
Wataru spun out. We lose.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.160
It looks like Keisuke won!

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.760
We'd prepared ourselves
for an all-out victory, but...

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.670
This is very disappointing.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:05.830
Indeed. If it weren't for this rain, I'm certain
you would have won the downhill.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.690
Wataru...

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.820
Brother...

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.000
I lost.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.040
<i>We were utterly defeated. Project D...</i>

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.680
<i>And Ryosuke Takahashi! They're on</i>
<i>a completely different level from us.</i>

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.340
Okay, we're moving out!
Be sure to pick up all your trash!

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
<i>A rose that's bloomed on the battlefield,</i>
<i>for the reason they don't know</i>

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.060
<i>A caterpillar that can only move forward</i>
<i>tramples it under foot again today</i>

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:33.360
<i>Yo, hates and pain, increasing only hatred</i>

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.460
<i>Hates and pain, with those</i>
<i>social conditions transmitted live</i>

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:46.210
<i>Hold me with stronger hands</i>

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:52.380
<i>Your voice in a restless night</i>
<i>(For the reason they don't know)</i>

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.450
<i>The world will someday be shedding blood</i>
<i>(All around the world)</i>

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:08.450
<i>Let me forget that kind of news,</i>
<i>I don't want to understand</i>

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:16.600
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:25.150
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.150
<i>Check it, conflicting information is</i>
<i>already reported by the mass media</i>

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:33.190
<i>The outnumbered convey the</i>
<i>deep fears of the whole situation</i>

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.190
<i>Reason is flammable, an age</i>
<i>lacking the power of restraint, yeah</i>

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.490
<i>Devoting yourself body and spirit,</i>
<i>you keep receiving that baptism</i>

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:48.500
<i>Nobody reason, nobody sure where is the end</i>

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.440
<i>If rowing a boat that's untrustworthy</i>
<i>and on the verge of breaking...</i>

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:04.520
<i>Nobody reason, no one</i>
<i>confess that it was wrong</i>

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:14.520
<i>Ah, sing gently just a little more, even if it's a lie</i>
