who knew nothing about cars

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.770

friends with Ryosuke Takahashi,

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.510
it made me a little sad.

No, uh...

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.750
It's something else, sir. My dad
bought a new car. Did you know?

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.550
Yeah, I know. An Impreza, right?

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.620
Oh, so you knew?

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.220

--An Impreza?!

I drove it this morning, yes.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.570
How was it?

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.270
I'll tell you how it was. For me,
it was like being in a flying saucer.

know how to drive the Eight-Six anymore.

You haven't changed at all, Itsuki.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.130
I get that all the time. "You aren't
makin' any progress at all."

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.200
No, that's not what I meant.

You're probably the type who
can't keep things hidden, huh?

think goes straight to my face.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.550
Uh, well, I've always been like this.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.920
I don't really get it myself!

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.990
Thank you very much!

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.830
Anyway, I still don't really understand.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.660
For someone with Takumi's skills,

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:35.470
it shouldn't be that hard to get as good
at four-wheel drive as he has at rear-wheel.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.840
Maybe he's talking on a level that's
impossible for us to understand.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.990
Say, Kazumi...

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.530
Do you mind if we swing by the pass where
Takumi and Wataru raced the other day?

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.430
I'd like to race that course in my own car.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.670
Sure. But that one's pretty difficult.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.110
Yup. And challenging it is what makes a man!

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.490
This takes a lot of steering work...

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.390
I can't really tell where the lines are!

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.890
Wow! Sure enough, that's turbo tuning for you!

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.840
<i>And sudden turbo boosts. This reminds me</i>
<i>of how my brother's Levin used to run.</i>

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.490
This is hard... It's so different from Akina.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.860
I couldn't run it at all.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:08.230
You say that, but you've really gotten good!
I feel safe riding next to you.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.870
Yeah, well! I've been practicing a lot!

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.360
My turbo's got its own quirks,
so I've gotta practice.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.240
<i>Dammit! It's no good...</i>

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.050
Takumi? He said that?

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.150
Huh. You don't say.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.420
Don't give me that "You don't say."

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.130
What are you planning this time?

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:16.100
Yeah, well... That's a long story,
so I'll leave out the specifics.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:21.100
The point is, I'm gonna have him experience
the awesome capabilities of more modern cars.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:27.440
You're doing that now? Takumi's already
done plenty of racing against modern cars.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.980
Yeah, but he doesn't <i>know</i> them.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.970
As a driver, he's specialized
only in the Eight-Six.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.920
He says he doesn't know how
to drive the Eight-Six anymore...

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.620
But the truth is, that shouldn't be the case.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.090
Meaning?

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:49.160
It's not the driving of it, but the
Eight-Six itself he's lost hope in,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.300
but he doesn't wanna acknowledge that,
so he's just comin' up with excuses.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.670
Still, this is just as I'd planned.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.270
Hey, don't tell me you're trying to force
him from the Eight-Six to the Impreza!

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.880
I wouldn't do that. That's <i>my</i> car.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.120
I think this is gonna take a bit of time.
But he's gonna have to work through it.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.700
<i>Mogi...</i>

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.740
<i>I wonder what she's doing these days.</i>

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.840
<i>I bet she's not lonely at all, though.</i>

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.410
<i>I've been so busy and stressed out with D</i>

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.510
<i>that it's like I've been charging forward</i>
<i>with no time to think of anything else.</i>

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:45.150
<i>I wonder if I'm losing steam.</i>
<i>I sure am thinking about her a lot.</i>

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.250
<i>Why do I feel this lonely?</i>

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.040
Up to this point, it's not all that different...

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.380
But here!

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.780
This is where it all changes.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.020
<i>I can't believe it! Even in the rain...</i>

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.250
<i>...there's such a sense of stability.</i>

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:38.410
So this cousin of mine living in Higashi
Matsuyama drives this silver Altezza

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:42.880
and let me drive it one time,
and it's <i>such</i> an awesome car!

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.710
An Altezza, huh? Sure is.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.920
Huh? Aren't you going to answer?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.220
No, it's nothing important.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.430
<i>Hm! She doesn't want anyone</i>
<i>to butt in on our private date!</i>

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.230
Hey, goddammit!

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.930
How long're you gonna keep us waitin'?!

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.270
Move your ass, register boy!

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.970
I'm very sorry for the wait, sir.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.140
Um, will this be all together or...

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.730
We're payin' separate, of course, dipshit!

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.920
Those guys just now drive Lancer Evos...

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.820
Say, Itsuki.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.930
Will you let me drive your Levin a little bit?

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.430
I have a license but no car, so if I don't
get behind the wheel once in a while,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.030
I'm worried I'll forget how to drive.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.500
Sure thing. Of course!

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.200
I can be your coach!

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.550
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.350
<i>How can I race so that this</i>
<i>car won't lose to my dad's?</i>

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.060
<i>The more I drive, the more I don't know.</i>

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:25.000
<i>What a screwup. How many years</i>
<i>has it been since I've spun out?</i>

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.490
<i>No matter how I look at it, it's no use.</i>
<i>The Eight-Six can't beat that car.</i>

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:52.010
<i>I thought I'd been giving it my all up till now,</i>
<i>but I'll have to go one step further.</i>

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.440
<i>I'm going to have to squeeze every</i>
<i>ounce out of this car's potential.</i>

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:02.210
<i>If I can't, then I don't have what it</i>
<i>takes to be a driver in Project D.</i>

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:17.100
You again? If you're looking
for Kazumi, she's not here.

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.440
Oh, really? Do you mind if I wait?

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.710
I have to meet with her...
speak with her one more time.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.040
Otherwise, I think this regret
will never go away.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.150 line:50 %
"Tea""Boxed Lunches"

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.380 line:50 %
"Sweets Fair""Original Cakes"

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.250
Huh? It's my brother.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.280
Hello?

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:51.430
Do you know what kind of a position
that puts me in? Just say, "Leave."

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.000
I don't care. I'm hanging up now.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.770
What is it? Is everything all right at home?

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.830
Oh, it's nothing.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.960
Unbelievable. Itsuki's been
on a date since this morning...

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.460
...but I have to go out on a
Saturday drive with your ass.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.100
Yeah, back at you.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.800
What is it?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.770
At that convenience store just now,
wasn't that Itsuki's Levin?

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.270
The little bugger's going on a date
around here, is he? All right!

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.310
Something seems a little off.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.320
Yeah, kind of awkward somehow.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.220
What do you say we head back?
I can take you most of the way there.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.290
I...

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.280
I don't want to go home tonight.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.730
D-Did you hear that just now, Iketani?!

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:04.140
It can't be! The line that
every man wants to hear!

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.670
Hey, Iketani!

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.540
<i>She doesn't want to go home?! So that means...</i>

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.350
<i>Oh! Her face, so deep in thought...</i>

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.370
<i>It must be that!</i>

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:24.930
S-So right now, you and me...

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.190
Let's go get a room!!

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:27.730
Shock and awe!!

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.260
H-He said it!

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.100
There's no way it could
go that smoothly, though.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.270
There's gotta be some turn of--

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.000
Okay.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.040
Hey! Hey, pull yourself together, Iketani!

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.910
But...

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.720
Before we do, there's
something I want to tell you.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.410
Not here. Let's go over there.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.600
Um, I'll be honest...

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:07.360
I was dating someone up
until about a month ago.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.910
I think I still haven't gotten over him.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:21.220
But going forward, you and I can get closer,

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.220
and I think I can forget about that other guy.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.260
If you can accept that...

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.660
...then I can be with you.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.000
Um, when you said you were "dating" him,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.060
I guess you two got rooms in hotels and stuff.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.280
I'd like to ask one more thing.
About how many times?

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.980
Like, more than ten? Or maybe less?

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.820
Probably... more, I think.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:14.130
<i>Suck it up, Itsuki! I know it's</i>
<i>a shock, but hang in there!</i>

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:18.110
Itsuki, do you hate me now?

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.510
N-No, I don't, but...

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.230
I finally found you.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.730
Wataru.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.840
Let's go, Itsuki. There's no
reason to stick around here.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.170
Kazumi, wait. You can't just run away.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.640
This has got nothing to do with you!

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.510
I'm sayin' I don't like cowards.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.550
If you've got nothing to feel guilty about,
then don't go hangin' up on people!

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:05.090
Kazumi, won't you listen to what I have to say?

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.820
You can't suddenly say something like
that to me. Don't bother me anymore!

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.890
I want you to hear this.
I want to get back together.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.070
There's a reason I've been
acting so indecisive toward you.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.770
I wasn't confident.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:31.510
I'm just a normal, plain old office worker.
Plus there's the age difference...

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.280
I thought there was no way

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.080
a young girl would want to hang
out with someone like me forever.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.420
It'd just be a matter of
time before she left me...

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:44.520
So I acted like this was a game.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.530
But that's not how I really feel.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:53.300
Being away from you, I learned full
well how important you are to me.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.770
Kazumi, I need you.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.640
<i>What the hell's with this guy?!</i>

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.270
<i>He shows up out of nowhere</i>
<i>and starts talking shit.</i>

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.310
<i>Right now, she and I are in love!</i>

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.650
Itsuki...

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.590
What are you waiting for?
There's no reason to hold back.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.720
Just go with how you feel.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.290
Run to the chest of the
man you really care for!

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:24.560
Itsuki... Yeah, you're right.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.280
Well, that backfired.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.470
<i>So</i> lame!

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.540
What should we do, Kenji?

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.040
What do you mean, "What should we do?"
We can't go out and talk to him <i>now</i>, can we?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.480
This is the time to act like a true friend.
Let's sneak out of here.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:22.180
<i>You're crying, huh, Itsuki?</i>
<i>I, too, know your pain!</i>

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.330
<i>Hi...</i>

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.730
<i>It's no good! Nothing I try works!</i>

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.340
<i>What the heck should I do?!</i>
<i>I don't understand anything anymore!</i>

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.190
