Five... Four... Three... Two... One...

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.010
Go!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.260
The eighth round, eh?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.930
I'd given it up for lost, but then...

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.100
Now I'm on the edge of my seat again!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.330
The "blind attack" paired with a
variation of the gutter-drop, eh?

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.110
Even the great God Arm got taken by surprise.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.110
And that's how his absolute
conviction was shattered...

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.210
Still, if Fujiwara knew he was going
to use the modified gutter-drop,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.020
didn't he have the chance to spring it sooner?

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.950
Without being dragged along
as things got so intense...

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.790
You have it wrong.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.960
The truth is, he wanted to use
it sooner, but was not allowed to.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.400
He was controlled, at the will of his opponent,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.600
with no chance at all to take the initiative.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.240
Only after his tires had lost their grip
and he'd been driven to such dire straits

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.810
was he able to turn the tables.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.710
Or rather, he was released from his "bonds."

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.110
I get it.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.650
Going forward is where things get intense.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.380
His opponent is not naive enough
to be fooled by the same trick twice.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.980
This ain't good.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.630
A war of attrition isn't in Jo's favor.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.430
In terms of stamina, he's got
the short end of the stick.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.230
But there's no way Mr. Joshima could lose...

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.740
Jo's a perfectionist.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.970
He'll try to win "smart,"
by some plan he's thought up.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.140
I just hope he hasn't lost his concentration
from things not going his way.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.830
<i>I'm still so confused...</i>

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.800
<i>Do I open it up full-throttle,</i>
<i>and attempt to outrun him?</i>

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.840
<i>It's a rather plain approach,</i>
<i>but it's the only one.</i>

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.210
<i>I'll show you one more thing before</i>
<i>weariness takes my concentration...</i>

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.610
<i>...the so-called record-line attack!</i>

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.860
<i>What round is this?</i>
<i>The seventh? No, the eighth.</i>

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.130
<i>I'll stay right on him, no matter what!</i>

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.830
<i>If I'm feeling the hurt, then so is he.</i>

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.530
With things getting this complicated,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.230
I worry about the Eight-Six
having mechanical problems.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.030
All I can think about is
that it's hardly a new car...

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.070
You don't have to worry
about that. I guarantee it.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.110
Enough time and money
have gone into maintaining it

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.750
that it could do ten or even twenty
full-speed downhill races without a hitch.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.110
I hope so...

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.090
My one worry is the modified gutter-drop,
which uses the curbstone.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.020
Unlike the gutters at Akina, the ones
here will place strain on the suspension,

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.730
so repeated drops are a bit scary.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.460
I think Fujiwara is aware
of this as well, though.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.560
But if that's his only way to win this...

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.740
Then in a clinch, he may use it again.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.980
Whoa...

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.780
This is awesome!
I like how much power it's got.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.990
Even I can tell how much
stability the 4WD adds.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.790
Going from this to the Eight-Six,
I bet it'd be a bit discouraging.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.760
I can see how Takumi would
get into a slump over it.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.440
Now look...

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.170
Usin' some half-assed word like "slump"
means he's still just some kid.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.420
For Takumi, the Eight Six and the Akina
run were the absolute standard.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.320
It was a good environment for him to get
some basic techniques under his belt.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.360
Well, yeah. What would take your
average guy five years to accomplish,

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.590
he's done in less than one.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.200
Yeah.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.670
And he's reached the next step, increasin'
the number of techniques to choose from.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.540
Nothin' clear-cut, more like an
expansion on some basic fundamentals

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.510
is what he needs.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.970
'Cause durin' a race, any one absolute
standard is gonna go bye-bye.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:36.320
For example, there could be one ideal
racin' line you can draw on a map,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.060
but in the real world, there're any
number of lines to choose from, right?

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.290
Yeah.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:47.000
Put simply, a dogfight means tryin'
to screw up the other guy's line.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.740
So long as you tear his down and stick to
your own, there's no way he can pass you.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.370
True enough.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.340
Bein' able to use <i>any</i> line...
now that's the real deal.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.710
Just think of what I'm havin' Takumi do now

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.840
as a menu to develop the
skills to use his techniques.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.320
Little by little, we're seein'
some definite results.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.990
Compared to the old Takumi,
he's a completely different guy.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.830
Takumi's developing at a
frighteningly fast pace, is he?

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.730
I guess. But...

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.010
He's still got a long way to go.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:38.710
<i>Incredible... Something is different</i>
<i>about this eighth round!</i>

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.030
<i>I never placed much importance</i>
<i>on racing lines for street races.</i>

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:56.270
<i>All I think about is using my tires to</i>
<i>the fullest and having a good race.</i>

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.370
<i>Through practicing the single-handed steer,</i>
<i>I noticed that if you fully utilize your tires,</i>

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.470
<i>then no matter what line you take,</i>
<i>it won't make much difference in racing time.</i>

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.210
<i>Following that thinking,</i>

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:14.420
<i>the resulting line is that which</i>
<i>most effectively uses the tires!</i>

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.390
<i>That's precisely what the "record line"is!</i>

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.490
<i>To me, the ideal racing line</i>
<i>is not to be sought.</i>

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.500
<i>It is nothing more than a result!</i>

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.120
<i>What I'm seeing is so incredible!</i>

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.480
Part of being fast on the mountain pass

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.790
is being able to enter
corners without hesitation.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.490
How well you know the course
is a vital element of this.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.600
It is also a basic principle in the
theory of high-speed public racing.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.300
It is for this reason

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.300
that practice is emphasized
during D's expeditions.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.140
So... local drivers who've raced
the course for a long time

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.540
have an advantage?

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.840
Correct. Especially during races
between two drivers of great skill,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.880
knowledge of the course will
ultimately become a weapon.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.220
Then how will this race turn out?

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.520
It will be a battle of endurance.
He who can't endure will lose.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.990
<i>He's pulling away.</i>

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.230
<i>Why? What's causing the gap?</i>

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.960
<i>What's different?!</i>

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.800
<i>We're almost to the goal. At this rate, I'll lose!</i>

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.970
<i>The goal is just ahead.</i>
<i>If I maintain this distance...</i>

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.320
<i>Dammit! My concentration...</i>

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.550
<i>Just a little farther.</i>

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.020
<i>I have to do something.</i>

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.020
<i>Anything I can do, I'll do it!</i>

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.760
<i>I-I've done it now...</i>

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.270
<i>Did he miscalculate his speed</i>
<i>when crossing the curbside?</i>

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.980
<i>The suspension isn't working!</i>

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.380
<i>It's no good...</i>

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.940
<i>I lost!</i>

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.200
I can't believe it.
To think you'd lose this way...

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.030
I'm real sorry.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:54.970
Now, I'm not trying to make excuses,
but it got hot all of a sudden, right?

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:00.710
I lost my appetite, and started thinking,
maybe I'm just tired inside.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.450
But vomiting while driving...
I still can't believe it myself.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:09.120
Too bad you didn't puke
while headin' to the goal line.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.320
It was just a little farther, y'know.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.020
That wouldn't have been smart at all.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.130
For one thing, I couldn't
maintain concentration.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.500
The tiredness hit me all at once,
like a hole opening up in a dam.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.670
You'd been racing for so long...

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.800
I didn't think it would be this drawn out.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.640
I'd expected it to be over one round earlier.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:37.580
This means the man they've called
a god is now just a middle-aged guy.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.720
This is a bit of a handful.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.920
We'll have to run an alignment
check once we're back in Gunma.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.060
Does it look like it can be driven back?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.260
It'll be fine so long as it runs at a normal speed.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.430
I'm sorry.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.330
Don't be so down.
The car will be soon repaired.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.500
Yeah...

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.710
I was the one who instructed you to use
the curbside, though aware of the risk.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.940
You may feel you've lost in
terms of driving techniques,

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.440
but the end result is, you won.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.520
That may be so, but I...

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.590
This was a good learning experience.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.050
The key point this time was the line.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:22.060
Your perception of the racing
line has changed, hasn't it?

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.900
Don't forget this experience today.
You're still learning... developing.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.900
Both you and Project D.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.770
Now get some rest. With the
Eight-Six in this condition,

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.110
the timed race will consist solely
of Keisuke on the hillclimb.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.740
All right.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.780
Please, Keisuke. Set this course a new record!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.410
Yeah.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.760
<i>Still, Fujiwara's luck at winning is such</i>

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:58.500
<i>that it cannot be explained through</i>
<i>mathematical probability theory.</i>

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.270
<i>When racing professional racer</i>
<i>Tomoyuki Tachi, and then tonight...</i>

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:09.270
<i>...he achieved miraculous victories.</i>
<i>He is a mysterious fellow.</i>

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.900
<i>Perhaps he was born having been</i>
<i>bestowed with a special something.</i>

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.770
You all right?

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.300
Yeah. Somehow or other.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.710
You'd seem to pretty much
have this in the bag.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.340
I guess. Unfortunately,
the young'un from Gunma

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.480
won't be makin' any records
with that car of his.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.650
The car I used for the timed race,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.220
I could use that as-is even on the pro circuit.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.190
Those can't exactly be called
fair conditions, can they?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.290
If street racing had any regulations,
that'd clearly be against the rules.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.700
Yeah, oh, well. After all, I lost the race...

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.570
I gotta have him let me
save some face in the end!

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.570
What about that downhill kid?

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.470
What if he hadn't busted his Eight-Six
and he could've run the timed race?

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.880
In that case... Hmm...

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.180
I think I could've come through.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.750
Hey now, that doesn't sound very confident.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.390
You're saying the course record
that you set with your S2000

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.260
could be beaten by an Eight-Six?

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.060
I can't scoff at the idea.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.530
When it comes to the downhill,
that Eight-Six makes the grade.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:43.530
His speed and concentration were
on a level beyond what I expected.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:48.560
Just for a second, he got <i>me</i> to
grip the wheel with both hands.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.380
I get it. He was that good
of an opponent, was he?

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.550
Such perfection at such a young age...

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.450
Frightening, isn't it?

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.070
--How is it?!
--No good.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:21.770
Dammit! Even though he set new personal
bests on the second and third tries?!

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.270
No good, huh?

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.080
Let's give Mr. Toudou a thorough
report on what happened here.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.060
Yeah. My body feels so
achy that I can't stand it.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.160
I want to race him again!

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.420 line:50 %
"National Park"

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.420 line:50 %

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.670
Too bad, huh?

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.230
It couldn't be helped.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.300
Still, you ran a good race.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.140
You mind if I say somethin'?

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.910
You're not the kind of driver
who should be here forever.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.780
If you like, I can introduce
you to the right contacts.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:13.620
I appreciate the offer, but there are
still things that I have to do here.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.370
I see. Well, I can't force you.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:23.960
See ya.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.830
<i>We're not ready yet.</i>

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.640
<i>There's room to get better and better.</i>

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.540
Um...

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:53.030
Let me warn you, though, my style
is irregular and completely my own.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:58.240
I don't know that a driver of your
level will learn anything from it.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.470
Racing in the God Arm's passenger seat...

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.140
A pretty choice arrangement, no?

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.810
He consented readily and most agreeably.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.580
Truth be told, I'd like to be
sitting in that seat myself.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.250
Okay, shall we go?

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.980
Yes, please.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.730
For Fujiwara, an experience this
valuable will almost never come along.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.660
Simply being able to see the techniques
of Toshiya Joshima up close...

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.660
Yeah.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:30.570
<i>The two of them are a</i>
<i>remarkably similar type of driver.</i>

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.440
<i>Fujiwara no doubt made a dramatic impact...</i>

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.240
<i>What's incredible about the single-handed</i>
<i>steer isn't racing with one hand.</i>

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.610
<i>Keep a close eye out for why that is, Fujiwara.</i>

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.720
<i>D shall continue with its races...</i>

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:58.600
<i>Learn well what you see for</i>
<i>the challenging races to come.</i>

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.200
<i>Now, you must simply absorb what you need.</i>

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.100
<i>The day will come when it shall be of use.</i>

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.980
--Not this...
--...situation...

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.110
...friggin' <i>again</i>?

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:26.160
I swear, you guys' love lives
are dead in the water.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.930
Come on, Boss, don't say that.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:34.930
When I was young, even I always
had a woman or two around.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:39.500
Maybe one of us is giving off
a "Women stay back!" aura...

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.130
Could be.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.970
Hey, why're you looking at me?!

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.950
Takumi!

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.950
They say you won again!

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.290
No... How can I put this? I guess it was a draw.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.260
Just say it already! A win is a win!

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.130
Well, looking at the big picture,
I can't really say that...

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.100
You're in the Impreza today?
Where's the Eight-Six?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.470
The underbody was damaged in
yesterday's race. It's still being fixed.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.500
--So you're free today?!
--Yeah...

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.810
Then what do you say we do
a long overdue run together?

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.340
Right, Iketani? Kenji?

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.710
Yeah, that'd be great! Maybe I'll have
Takumi show me a thing or two!

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.880
Yeah.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.850
We're all young and girlfriend-less,
so we should add Takumi to the ranks

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.290
and <i>bam</i>, do it up!

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.990
<i>Honestly, four fine young men, and yet...</i>

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:39.560
<i>--...all so sadly lacking when it comes to women.</i>
--By the way, where's Project D going to next?

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.700
I don't know. But no matter where we
go or who we face, I'll give it my all.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:46.970
So <i>cool</i>!

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.170
