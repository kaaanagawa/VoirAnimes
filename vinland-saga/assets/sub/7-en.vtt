WEBVTT

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.850
In the 11th century,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.190
the invasion by Denmark's army 
and the Vikings

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.400
continued to intensify.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.240
ENGLAND 1012 AD

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.290
In October,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.800
the attacks, which had continued for several years,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.670
reached a turning point.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.300
VICINITY OF JELLING DENMARK 
KING SWEYN'S ESTATE

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.800
Are you telling me 
to withdraw my troops from England?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.640
We're not withdrawing. We're letting them rest.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.900
Marching in the winter weakens them.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.610
Let the soldiers rest.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.320
Yes, sir. As you wish.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.700
The summer.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.500
We're going to strike next summer.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.420
I, too, shall lead an army in battle.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.630
So, suddenly we get a break?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.970
ENGLAND COAST 
DANISH ARMY BASE

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.090
I want to go home.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.640
We don't need those pirates for now, either.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.310
I thought I'd be able to earn a lot this year.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.650
We can't do anything, 
now that the army is staying put.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.070
This is why I hate being a hired hand.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.320
What's Askeladd going to do?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.490
Askeladd.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.910
It'd be a shame to spend all winter like this.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.830
And we already raided all the good villages.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.460
True.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.460
What are you going to do?

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.340
We can't do anything about it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.470
We're going to do what the birds do.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.850
We'll go to where the food is.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.950
KINGDOM OF FRANCE 
VICINITY OF LOIRE RIVER

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.450
Don't just stand there.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.750
They have a ram.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.460
Bring the crossbowmen.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.710
One. Two.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.430
Alternate fire with two groups.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.840
Aim.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.930
Fire.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.480
It's no good. Retreat.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.840
It looks like the Franks are fighting 
amongst themselves.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.300
The fort's defended by only a few men.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.220
The attackers have 800.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.090
I can't believe they attacked the fort head-on.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.720
So, this is the local clan's headquarters.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.730
How about it? Doesn't it smell like treasure?

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.150
So, that's what you're after.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.860
Let's do it, Askeladd.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.230
We'll side with the attackers.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.240
Let's smash open the treasure chest, 
and take everything inside.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.740
All right.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.990
I was wondering why we came to the boonies.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.620
You're amazing, Askeladd.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.370
Your predictions were spot-on.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.580
Let's make up our loss from England.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.340
Okay, Thorfinn.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.380
You're up.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.400
We're going to war.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.710
NORMANNI

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.370
We're going to war.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.630
Make contact with their leader.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.210
Give him this message:

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.420
"You're terrible at battle.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.930
I can't stand watching you.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.600
Therefore, my men will help you.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.180
This is a once-in-a-lifetime offer.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.100
I shall lead you to victory, no matter what.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.440
Once the fort falls, we will take half of the spoils.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.110
We shall attack again tomorrow morning."

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.990
After you deliver the message, stay in their camp, 
and observe the situation.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.280
Got it? Then go.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.370
What's wrong?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.750
Go, Thorfinn.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.920
Do you have any idea how many people I've killed?

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.510
I went scouting,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.430
and I also brought up the rear.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.100
I've accomplished enough.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.560
But you...

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.230
What? You want a reward?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.780
If you close the deal, I'll give you three gold pieces.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.910
I swear in the name of Tyr.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.530
Don't test me.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.870
How long do you plan to keep running away?

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.910
I'm so scared.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.460
I was just joking.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.750
But you know...

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.800
You'd have to bring me at least one head with a helmet, 
if you want that.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.100
He never changes.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.110
Are you sure it's okay 
to let him handle the negotiation?

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.070
Soldiers are short-tempered 
when they're weak.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.740
They might kill the messenger, 
before the negotiations start. It happens all the time.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.160
Who cares if we lose some kid that follows us?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.830
What are you doing, kid?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.960
This is no place for a kid.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.130
I'm a messenger.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.170
Is there anyone who can speak Norse?

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.680
What's wrong with you? What language is that?

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.430
He's not a Frank.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.270
Is he a spy from the fort?

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.100
Secure him.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.190
I'm a messenger.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.950
Is there anyone who can speak Norse?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.580
You want half of the spoils?

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.460
You mercenaries. Don't push your luck.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.920
"You want half of the spoils? 
Don't push your luck."

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.550
You're pretty confident in yourself.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.840
Normanni kid.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.340
Normanni?

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.720
Those people from the north attacking England?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.850
"Those people from the north attacking England?"

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.600
Even a kid can see it.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.270
If you keep attacking the front gate, 
your men are just going to die.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.360
Their defenses are weak on the lake.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.020
We're going to attack there.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.360
Your plan is ill-considered.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.860
The river that leads to the lake gets steeper upstream.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.120
There's even a waterfall.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.910
Our ship sunk downstream.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.870
That's what would happen 
if you attacked from the lake.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.540
"That's what would happen 
if you attacked from the lake."

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.500
Then do you want to turn down my offer?

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.130
Then Askeladd and his hundred men are going 
to join the defenders in the fort.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.930
He'll do the same thing if I die too.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.140
If I don't signal that the deal has been closed,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.890
you're going to make enemies 
of a hundred fierce men from the Northern Sea.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.440
Very well.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.440
Your Highness.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.570
But...

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.280
if you're lying, I'm going to cut off your head.

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.950
If you're telling the truth, 
then in the name of Jesus Christ,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.410
I'll share my bread equally.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.290
"I'll share my bread equally."

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.170
Give me back my dagger.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.040
It's a memento from my father.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.360
It's Thorfinn's signal.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.770
One high arrow, and two low arrows.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.030
Let's hurry.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.280
Let's cross the pass before the moon rises.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.660
We're stuck guarding the ship the whole time.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.040
I want to fight too.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.500
Damn that fat general.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.840
Over there.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:23.260
It's a dragon!

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.810
It's on the mountain.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:35.730
A dragon?

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.490
You said, the dragon climbed the mountain?

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.990
Yes. Last night, 
the soldiers guarding the ship all reported they saw it.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.700
I see.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.160
It's a bad omen, Your Highness.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.170
I want to see it too.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.130
Kid.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.260
Your friends haven't come yet.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.720
"I want to see it too."

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.140
The sun is already up.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.640
"The sun is already up."

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.930
Just attack, you fat-ass.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.140
You'll understand soon.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.190
You said something mean just now, didn't you?

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.400
It looks like our entertainment for tonight is going 
to be cutting off your head.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.860
Forward march.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.870
Forward march.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
Forward.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.630
Attack.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.640
Oh, no. It's started.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.140
We're late. Bastards.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.310
Put your heart into it.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.150
The battlefield is waiting.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.030
It'll be the same every time.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.950
Come on.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.040
Put a bridge on the west side too.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.540
I don't care how many men we lose.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.000
Hey. Which one is their leader?

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.840
The one with the feather on his helmet.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.800
It's him.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.300
A head with a helmet.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.350
You bastard.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.850
He was lying. Kill him.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.850
Kill the kid.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.280
You bastard.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.660
You let the kid escape. 
You haven't captured the fort.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.120
What's wrong with you guys?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.580
You're thinking you'll go home, 
once the snow falls.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.830
That's not going to happen.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.120
You're not going home until the fort is captured.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.640
What?

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.020
Heave-ho.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.190
Row. Full speed ahead.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.410
Whoever gets there first gets twice as much.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.950
Put your heart into it.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.210
I see.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.710
Those were friendly forces. 
All troops, forward. Don't stop until the fort falls.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.470
Never imagined they'd carry their ship over the pass.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.680
Don't hesitate.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.050
Eighty men from the right wing, 
go to the boat landing.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.220
Crossbowmen, this way.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.030
Is that all you got?

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.570
The lake's not a barrier.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.030
It's a shallow pond that makes for a perfect attack.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.530
Great. We're going in.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.630
What? They pierced my shield, 
even though they're so far away.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.800
They got Olov.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.340
Askeladd.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.840
Crossbowmen?

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.300
We're going to take a few losses.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.310
This is the perfect chance.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.060
Fire as much as you can before they land.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:30.690
A child?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.030
What?

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.870
They stopped attacking?

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.290
Maybe they ran out of arrows.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.040
Men. Prepare to land.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.670
This is our chance.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.840
-Oh, no. 
-Kill him.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.420
-This is for the captain. 
-Damn.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.130
-That kid's crazy. 
-Get him.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.600
Go. Storm them.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.360
All right. Go on a rampage.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.160
Holding the gate's too hard for these guys.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:07.500
Hurry up, and kill them all, guys.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.260
One. Two.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.120
Those Normannis are crazy.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:57.130
That fortress was no match 
against my military tactics.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.390
The captain of the fortress defense died in battle.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.060
The soldiers said, a kid did it.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.350
That kid?

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.850
Never underestimate a Normanni.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:13.310
If I send him back now, 
he's going to become an enemy.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.020
What shall we do?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.700
Those guys came over the pass, right?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.200
They'll probably go back the same way, 
carrying the ship.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.120
That's when we'll attack.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.250
A sailor on land is like a baby.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.130
Your Highness.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.050
I have a message for General Jabbathe.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.260
What is it? Tell me.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.300
The treasure room...

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.690
Where's my treasure?

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.820
They also plundered the church 
and the houses of all the leaders.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.900
They took everything.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.400
What?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.780
I see.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.700
I have a message for the leader of the Franks.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.950
What?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.710
As for your half of the spoils,

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.880
you get victory,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.250
and we get the treasure.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.210
You're fine with that, right?

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.340
I think we're being quite generous here, you know.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.890
We let you have the fort, after all.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.350
-You bastards. 
-Oh, no.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.230
-They'll descend the waterfall. 
-Savages.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.150
-Get the boats. 
-You pirates.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.480
-All boats in the fort have been destroyed. 
-You greedy beasts.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.490
You scammers.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.280
You country bumpkins.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.570
I can't understand French.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.200
Now then, shall we call it a night?

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.040
Thorfinn hasn't returned.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.790
Oh, really?

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.040
Oh, well. I bet he's dead anyway.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.460
Now there's more treasure for us.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.720
You're alive?

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.220
You're tough, kid. Did you get hurt?

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.140
Askeladd.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.890
It's the captain's head.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.400
Well, did you cut it off?

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.940
You promised.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.400
I won't let you say no.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.870
I, warrior from Iceland, son of Thors, Thorfinn,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.960
in the name of my father's sword, 
challenge you, Askeladd, to a duel.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.540
To avenge my father's death.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.710
-Hey. 
-He wants to duel now?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.920
He's got guts.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.340
I, son of Olaf, Askeladd,

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.140
in the name of Artorius, my ancestor,

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.390
accept your challenge, Thorfinn.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:54.810
However...

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.400
ask me again later.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.940
We're getting out of here now.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.900
Row, men.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.400
If you don't hurry up, they'll capture the river.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.700
You bastard. Don't play the fool with me.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.080
Who cares if there's a dragon?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.250
I'm not scared.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.370
Right, right.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.670
But you know...

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.420
It's here!

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:41.940
Goodbye.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.980
Franks.

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.910
-Let's go home. 
-We struck it big.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.950
We'll survive the winter.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.580
Yeah.
