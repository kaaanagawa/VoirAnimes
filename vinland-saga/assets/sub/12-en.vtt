00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
THE LAND ON THE FAR BANK

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.420
Are the fish biting?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.300
The fish are already in hibernation, right?

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.520
I don't care if I don't catch anything.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.060
My real job is operating the ferry.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.400
You guys are Danes, right?

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.730
You speak good English,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.440
but you have a bit of an accent.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.490
Your accent sounds just like people from my country.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.910
How much would it cost to take us to 
the opposite shore?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.830
Two silver pieces.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.790
If you don't have silver, I also take alcohol. 
Well, then...

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.750
I wonder how many days it would take me to bring 
all of you.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.970
No. I only need you to bring this letter.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.050
I thought you were customers. That's too bad.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.220
So, who do you want me to deliver it to?

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.100
To any one of the elders. It's urgent.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.940
Please tell them it's from Askeladd, 
son of Lydia.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.200
Understood. I'll hurry.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.640
Askeladd!

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.770
Askeladd! Where are you? Hey!

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.860
Ragnar. Please be quiet.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.520
Why did you stop the march?

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.110
Thorkell is going to catch up!

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.620
We're not supposed to make noise 
while The Ear is at work.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.330
Ear?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.000
Bjorn.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.370
Don't let that conehead breathe.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.710
Ear! Whatâ€™s the status?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.050
They've gotten closer since yesterday.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.840
I can hear soldiers and horses marching.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.930
There's about 500.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.810
They're close behind us.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.640
They're only one day away on foot.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.600
Are you serious?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.730
Yesterday, you said they were two days away.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.270
You don't trust my ears?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.610
That was fast.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.320
They're marching fast.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.070
They'll catch up to us in just a few days.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.620
Quiet, you guys.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.880
Horses. On the hill. Two of them.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.390
They've got us now.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:08.890
What do we do?

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.970
If we're going to meet them 
in battle, we must take positions!

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.310
No, that's impossible. 
We're no match for them.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.020
But if we don't do anything...

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.520
I've sent a request for reinforcements.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.110
We'll keep running until they arrive.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.240
-What? 
-Reinforcements?

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.670
NOVEMBER 1013 AD WEST ENGLAND 
DOWNSTREAM EAST BANK OF SEVERN RIVER

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.750
Reinforcements?

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.000
We're deep in enemy territory!

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.210
That's what Askeladd said, though.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.050
He's never lied to us about something like that before.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.680
Well, you're right.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.100
But where's the closest fort?

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.220
It's Leicester.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.020
Seriously? It'll take two weeks to get there!

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.690
I wonder if the reinforcements will be in time.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.020
If we ask for reinforcements, we have to 
split the plunder, right?

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.780
Askeladd said we could handle it ourselves 
with just the hundred of us.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.320
I'm so tired! I want to get back on a ship!

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.030
Yeah.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.120
A ship would be nice...

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.690
What? Do you need something?

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.240
Everyone's worried.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.620
You should give them an explanation.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.410
Let them worry.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.460
Worrying will make them march faster.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.250
What?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.670
If that's all, then go to sleep.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.930
You've been acting weird the last few days. 
What are you up to?

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.690
Ever since you saw the prince's face. Right?

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.530
I've been living among criminals 
for 40 years.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.530
I can tell what a man is like,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.290
whether he's a big shot or a nobody, 
whether he's smart

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.200
or stupid, just by looking at his face.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.670
When I saw the prince's face, I could tell.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.890
"That's not the face of a king."

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.760
True. He looks like a girl.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.980
But he's still a kid, you know?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.520
That's true. He's still young. His future still awaits.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.610
What? His future still awaits?

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.740
All right! Wake up, guys!

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.200
Get ready to march! If you're slow, 
Thorkell is going to catch up!

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.790
Seriously?

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.870
It's still dark.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.840
Hey.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.130
-Yeah? 
-Were you able to sleep?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:13.630
No.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.680
Hey.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.180
Shut up. Be quiet.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.680
But if I don't keep talking,

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.810
I'm going to fall asleep.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.900
This is bad, Askeladd. They're right behind us.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.820
Yeah. I know.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.650
They're going to catch up.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.950
I said, I know.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.950
We're almost to where the reinforcements will come. 
Right there.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.890
-Reinforcements? 
-Them? Just the two of them?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.100
Maybe it's just an illusion made by the fog.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.740
I'm so honored that the commander has come himself.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.290
It's been a long time, Askeladd.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.990
So,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.290
you're saying a ship carried them across the river?

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.620
Do you know whose ship it was?

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.710
No. I'm not sure.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.050
The fog was as thick as goat's milk.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.590
It wasn't a Norse ship. It didn't have a dragonhead.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.550
It was kind of pudgy.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.680
It had an eye drawn on it. On the bow. Big, like this.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.560
That doesn't sound like one of King Sweyn's ships.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.780
In any case, we can't follow Thorfinn anymore.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.070
I underestimated them.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:45.740
I didn't think that the people across the Severn River 
were their allies.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.420
Does that mean the people across the river 
switched sides from England to Denmark?

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.460
You idiot! You don't know anything!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.460
The land on the other side of this river isn't 
part of England in the first place!

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.430
It's Wales.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.810
Wales is a mountainous region to the west of England.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.560
The steep mountains had few natural resources.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.110
Flat land suitable for agriculture was scarce.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.320
The land was poor compared to England.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.910
After the end of rule by the Roman Empire,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.450
Wales was never unified under a single country.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.080
The region was divided into many 
small, rival kingdoms for hundreds of years.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.920
Askeladd's request for reinforcements was answered

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.630
by one of those small kingdoms.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.140
EAST OF MORGANNWG KINGDOM 
WALES

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.810
I want to compliment you for this, Askeladd.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.980
Thorkell must be clenching his teeth in anger 
on the other side of the river.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.650
If we continue going by sea,

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.980
we can return to Gainsborough.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.820
No. We're going to go by land.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.950
What are you talking about? 
There's a ship right there.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.490
Don't look at it from the perspective 
of a large nation.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.960
For this country, even three warships 
are a valuable asset.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.710
We have to be thankful that they helped us 
escape from Thorkell in the first place.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.880
Then we can make do with only two ships! 
We can all fit!

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.260
No. If you keep acting selfish, 
I'm going to leave you behind.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.470
Are you telling me to walk across Wales? 
That's ridiculous!

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.350
The people in this land hate us!

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.650
I can't allow you to endanger His Highness any further!

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.150
A hawk.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.240
It's so low.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.200
Ragnar. Catch it.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.910
Pardon me, Your Highness, we're in the middle 
of something important.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.330
It's better than moving north through England 
with Thorkell at our heels.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.710
Anyway, this country is an ally of mine.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.550
If you're still worried...

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.210
Thorfinn!

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.010
I'll assign him to guard Canute.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.310
Wow! You're the guy from back there...

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.520
Don't make the decision for me.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.770
He's small, but he's good.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.150
And he's the same age as His Highness. 
I'm sure they'll get along.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.150
Say your greetings, Thorfinn.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.370
Are you an idiot? 
What are you glaring at him for?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You're going to reward me for this, right?

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:45.010
All right, all right. 
When we get to Gainsborough, I'll duel you.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.170
Askeladd. Are you ready?

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.800
Yes. We just finished. 
Oh, my. We're so busy.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.770
This is the general of the Kingdom of Morgannwg, 
Gratianus.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.440
He's going to show us the way.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.450
You have a threatening look about you, 
but you have a good face.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.280
Commander, that's one of my men.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.290
His Highness Prince Canute is over there.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.870
His eyes look weak.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.000
Is he really going to be the next ruler of England?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.550
What? You bastard! How rude!

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.550
There's only one reason 
we're helping the Danish prince escape.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.850
It's so that we can enter a treaty of non-aggression.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.810
It's all up to you. Prince, swear

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.690
that once you become the king of England,

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:46.780
you'll never interfere in the matters of Wales.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.460
Yes. Leave it to me.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.250
His Highness says,

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:06.840
"If you give us three ships--"

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.840
I asked the prince.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.090
What?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.600
Never mind. I'll ask again later.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.650
I'll prepare a written document in the meantime.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.110
Get ready to depart.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.070
What's wrong with that arrogant snob?

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.910
He's taking advantage of us!

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.870
Does he think he's an equal to the prince?

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.660
That country bumpkin!

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.840
Marching, marching, and more marching! 
Now we're marching in the mountains!

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.760
Mountains are better than Thorkell.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.890
Let's talk about something more fun.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.310
Like what?

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.810
Our reward from King Sweyn.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.310
We saved the prince from Thorkell.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.150
I want a farm!

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.690
I want a cool sword.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.660
No. It's all about the gold. Nothing's better than gold.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.780
Yeah.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.740
I heard the king has

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.830
a hundred beautiful slave women 
from around the world in his bedroom.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.130
Come here.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.960
I'm so excited! Is there anything else?

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.880
Hey, priest!

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.720
You've been to the palace, right?

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.100
What does the king have in his house?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.850
Well, there was nothing of value in particular.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.940
No way! Not even beautiful women?

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.320
Well, he did have a lot of slave women.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.650
What? Aren't you interested?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.120
You don't like women?

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.160
No. Gold, silver, and beautiful women are all nothing

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.830
compared to the thing I seek.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.630
Please tell us! What is it you're seeking?

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.010
Love.

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.760
-What? Love? 
-Yes.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.640
What's that? I've never heard of it.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.770
I know what it is. It's like a spell 
that the Christians are always chanting.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.310
Isn't it some kind of food?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.520
How many pounds in silver?

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.360
It can't be measured in silver,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.280
because love is what gives value to silver.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.040
Without love, gold, silver, and beautiful women 
are all worthless.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.870
"Gives value"?

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.160
That doesn't make sense.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.500
Silver has the value of silver.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.840
Don't make it so difficult.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.500
He's bluffing.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.090
Just ignore him.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.890
Hey, priest.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.230
Keep talking. I want to hear more.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.060
We're about to enter the Kingdom of Brycheiniog.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.190
Don't worry. I've talked to them already.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:19.990
Thank you for your help.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.620
We're not doing this for you. 
It's just that our interests are aligned.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.700
The Welsh kingdoms have always been

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.960
threatened by invasions from England.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.380
If you Danes can make them stop,

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.000
it would be good for us.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.470
I'm sure His Highness the Prince will promise you that.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.850
So, is that your king, Askeladd?

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.350
He's from a good bloodline.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.690
As for the rest, I have high hopes for him 
since he's young.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.530
The more you fall for a man, 
the less things go how you want.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:05.160
Maybe someone like him is just what we need.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.620
We're the descendants of Britannia.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.210
We're not going to follow the king of the Danes.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.040
Gratianus.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.510
Do you still believe in the legend?

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.010
The legend that Artorius will return 
from Avalon to the west

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.310
and restore the Britannia of old.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.190
Askeladd!

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.570
Are you sure?

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.360
That's what The Ear says.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.660
Thank you for coming, prince of the Danes!

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.710
They're messengers from Brycheiniog.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.420
Thank you for coming!

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.170
Wait! Gratianus.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.180
Did they notice?

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.840
How can you tell?

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.310
One of my men has good hearing.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.180
But it's too late.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.190
What's wrong, Thorfinn?

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.000
Get up! Hurry up!

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.670
Let's go.
