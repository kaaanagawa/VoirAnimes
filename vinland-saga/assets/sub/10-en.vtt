WEBVTT

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.110
Come on. I'm so cold.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.020
Ragnarok

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.030
How long do we have to wait here?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.030
We're not earning anything.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.610
The prince got scared.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.620
So we were right about Wessex.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.790
I'm sure about it.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.500
We got the short end of the stick--

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.590
Take that!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.560
-There's another one! 
-Get away! Get away!

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.850
Hey!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.020
Hurry up and attack!

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.530
You'll never go to Valhalla at this rate!

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.360
Are you just going to stand there?

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.530
You're just a bunch of scarecrows!

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.490
-Damn that bastard! 
-He's so full of himself!

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.750
None of you has any balls!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.000
Ragnar!

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.630
Letting him insult us like this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.510
is a disgrace to us warriors! Let's attack!

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.470
We're ready to fight!

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.930
We have 4000 men. I'm sure we can beat Thorkell!

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.140
Not yet. We're talking about Thorkell.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.150
We can't make a careless move.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.480
His Highness put us in charge of the siege.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.110
This is our chance to distinguish ourselves 
as warriors!

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.360
No.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.410
When the time comes, 
His Highness shall give the order.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.330
Now is the time to wait.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.080
Ragnar!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.800
And then the Lord was told,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.050
"Put your sword back into its place,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.340
for all those who take up the sword 
shall perish by the sword."

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.680
Father. Excuse me. Can you leave us alone 
for a moment?

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.900
-Orders? Who cares! 
-The prince is a coward!

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.650
I'm not going to sit here silent!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.110
Yeah! Let's do it!

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.610
Yeah! That's right!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.700
Don't worry.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.200
When winter comes, 
we will receive the order to withdraw.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.290
We'll just have to endure until then.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.170
Come on! You're kidding me!

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.920
God, please protect His Highness.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.310
Damn! What's wrong with you? You guys are no fun!

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.640
You're hard at work too.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.060
Are they being mean again?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.770
Shut up, Asgeir.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.860
We can't have a battle if they don't attack!

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.240
Don't be so loud. I bet they're just being more careful.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.240
They're under the command of the Prince of Denmark.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.200
What?

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.160
What? Is the Prince here?

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920
Huh? I thought I already told you.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.630
The second prince, His Highness Canute.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.250
Mother's here.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.630
And my sister too.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.970
Ari is slacking off again watching the sheep.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.020
Just the other day, they were saying that 
one went missing.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.110
That's right! It's time for dinner! 
I have to go tell Father!

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.160
Father!

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.410
Father!

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.290
We're having meat tonight. 
We're celebrating Yule.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.220
Oh, really? It's already the winter solstice?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.050
It's pretty warm, so I had forgotten about it.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.560
This is a nice place.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.810
There's enough grass for the animals. 
I'm glad we moved here.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.610
My sister says it's inconvenient living here 
because we can't get any slaves.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.530
We've never even had a slave, though.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.070
She would say that.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.450
I like it here.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.750
Mother seems to be feeling better after we moved here.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.380
Thorfinn.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.670
What?

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.050
You're my oldest son.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.050
You have to protect your mother and your sister. 
You understand, right?

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.220
Yeah.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.680
They're both waiting for you to come home.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.980
Having people like that

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.150
is a happy thing.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.910
Do you understand?

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.790
So stop thinking about revenge.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.670
Do you think that would make me happy?

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.650
The village!

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.690
Father! What are we going to do? We're under attack!

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.400
Mother! Sister!

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.350
Father!

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.170
Where was that?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.170
Somewhere warm...

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.460
with rolling plains of grass...

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.970
as far as the eye can see...

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.700
NOVEMBER, 1013 
OUTSKIRTS OF BATH

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.980
What in the world is our leader thinking?

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.150
It's almost winter.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.230
The main army withdrew to the north 
a long time ago.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.820
But we're still here picking off 
gloomy villages like this.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.580
Well, we have to earn what we can 
before going back.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.120
Then we should attack a bigger city!

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.290
Bristol is near here, right?

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.960
Are you stupid?

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.710
What can we do with only 100 men?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.800
What? Stupid?

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.380
Did you just call me stupid?

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.630
Huh, you heard me?

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.550
I guess your ears aren't stupid.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.430
What did you say?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.810
What's wrong with you?

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.680
What? I'm going to kill you!

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.070
Well, all that's left for this year 
is to plunder two or three more villages.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.440
I hope next year's going to be better.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.400
Do you think we'll still have a chance 
next year?

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.320
What?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.790
We've been plundering England 
for ten years already.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.450
This year was especially horrible.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.750
I heard that the King of England 
escaped overseas.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.420
That means 
that the King of Denmark has won.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.050
The war is coming to an end.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.260
Really? I think it's still too early.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.810
Thorkell's in London.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.770
You saw how strong he is, right?

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.690
Thorkell, huh? He is strong.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.770
But he's Norse, just like us.

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.030
Once the English are about to die, 
he'd ditch them in a heartbeat.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.200
Kill him.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:45.240
Again?

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.660
Kill him, Tore!

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.580
Take that!

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.670
Hey, guys! Why are they fighting?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.760
Ake called Tore stupid.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.550
Tore got mad.

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.800
But Ake wouldn't apologize 
and insulted him even more.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.850
What'd he say?

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.140
Cattle thief.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.520
I see.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.980
So that's what he said.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.770
Then it can't be helped.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.730
Just make sure you tell Askeladd afterwards, 
no matter who dies.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.990
What a pain.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.260
A fertile land.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.390
It's like the land I saw in my dream.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.140
It's really different from Iceland.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.150
I bet the snow is beginning 
to pile up around now.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.430
You're up early, Thorfinn.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.220
The sun hasn't even come up yet.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.780
So you couldn't sleep 
because they're too loud?

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.030
Well, go easy on them.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.960
They were frustrated since we've been 
marching a lot these days.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.870
You got to relax sometimes.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.750
Don't talk to me like we're close!

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.800
I think you've got the wrong idea.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.050
I'm not your friend.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.930
I bet you think you have me 
under your control.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.390
You're full of yourself now.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.650
But it'll stop when I slit 
your throat someday,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.520
and you fall over and die.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.150
I'm so scared.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.240
I never imagined that little kid would glare 
at me someday. You've grown a lot.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.960
Well, time is on your side.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.960
You're going to grow, 
and I'm going to get old.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.250
Someday, I'm going to lose to you.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.630
It's only natural.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.920
Even the strongest dies someday.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.220
Look around you, Thorfinn.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:56.470
These stones weren't made by the people

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.850
who live in England now, the Saxons.

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:03.270
They were made by the people who lived here 
before the Saxons.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.780
I heard they were a strong people.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.360
But they were destroyed 
by the Saxons 500 years ago.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.370
They were the Romans.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.790
The name of their country was Britannia.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.050
They had an advanced civilization.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.710
More advanced than what we have now.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.260
Stop beating around the bush.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.140
What are you trying to say?

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.390
You're so impatient.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.560
You should listen to what your elders say.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.520
Well, in other words,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.900
the world of man

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.400
is getting older gradually, but surely.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.110
The Saxons destroyed the Romans,

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.860
and we're going to destroy the Saxons next.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.290
The glory of the Roman Empire

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.080
is a thing of the distant past.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.000
Anyways, according to what 
the Christians are saying,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:12.050
the Last Judgment is coming 
in only 20 years.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.890
On that day, God will kill everyone,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.900
and our world will be completely destroyed.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.480
Ragnarok.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.120
Look, Thorfinn.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.870
It's ironic, right?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.830
Dawn in the age of twilight.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.690
It's a horse.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:07.400
Is it an English soldier?

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.690
No. He's an ally.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.660
That's weird. 
I thought we were the only ones in this area.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.870
Hey! Wait!

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.040
We're Askeladd's unit, under King Sweyn!

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.170
Where did you come from?

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.880
Oh, are you from the main army?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.630
I'm from Ragnar's unit 
under His Highness Prince Canute!

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.260
-I've got a message for the main force! 
-Prince Canute?

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.760
Are they close by?

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:44.020
Unfortunately, the main army is far north.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.440
They're on their way home.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.480
Then what are you doing here?

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.940
We're just trying to earn some pocket money 
in that village over there.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.950
You separated from the army on your own?

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.320
Well, don't be so stiff.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.530
Your horse looks tired.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.910
Do you want to trade it for a new one?

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:07.960
Thorkell?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.550
Yes. He's almost there.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.930
There's 500 men. He took along only 
his immediate followers.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.180
They're following the main army.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.520
They're going to reach Marlborough soon.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.180
Seriously?

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.730
-They're so close! 
-Attacking the main army with only 500?

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.980
What about the unit laying siege to London?

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.230
I thought Prince Canute had 4000 men.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.610
They were defeated a long time ago.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.370
I'm one of the survivors.

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:49.580
What?

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.090
With Thorkell leading them,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.140
they came out of the fortress.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.160
Take that!

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.000
They were all as strong as bears.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.880
We couldn't do anything.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.340
They're making a beeline for the main army.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.010
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.680
Lord, may they rest in peace.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.270
-I pray that their souls may be saved-- 
-Your Highness!

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.230
Thorkell is close! 
We must leave at once!

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.660
I found you, Prince!

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.830
So, what happened to His Highness Canute?

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.710
They captured him.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.210
He's with Thorkell's army.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.720
The remaining soldiers are trying to regroup 
to go get His Highness back.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.510
But we have less than 400 men.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.890
And their morale is low.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.310
I'm on my way to ask the main army for help.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.060
Join us. We'd be grateful to have 
even 100 extra men.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.570
What do you want to do? It's your decision.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.780
Askeladd.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.050
Come on. This isn't the time for us 
to just fade into the twilight.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.420
What?

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.340
Can't you hear it, Bjorn?

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.100
The sound of the footsteps

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.770
of Ragnarok.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.540
Bury him. And the horse he was riding.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.090
What? Okay.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:47.140
Listen up, guys!

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.430
We're going to go save 
His Highness Prince Canute!

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.060
We're up against 500 of Thorkell's men! 
But we're not going to ask for help!

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.020
It's time to place our bets!

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.820
His Highness Canute is second in line

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.610
for the throne of Denmark.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.280
We're going to get a lot of money no matter 
which side we hand him over to.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:11.410
Can you imagine...

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.750
the rewards we'd be granted

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.170
by the rulers of Denmark and England?

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.790
We can't let someone else take it away from 
right under our noses!

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.880
Yeah!

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.680
Let's do it! This is going to be ours!

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.140
We'll do it!

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.770
What are you going to do 
now that you've stirred them up?

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.230
We're up against Thorkell. 
Do you have a plan for winning?

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.150
Who knows.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:50.160
"Who knows"? Are you--

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.240
This is the age of twilight, Bjorn.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.540
Let's go out with a bang.
