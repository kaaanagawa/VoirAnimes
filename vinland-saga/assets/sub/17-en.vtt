WEBVTT

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.940
Oh! I saw a flash.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.650
-Hey! 
-What's that?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.710
Oh, really?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.920
Then this is where we say goodbye.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.170
I'm in a hurry. Excuse me.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.530
Don't put on airs, you grunts.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.330
If you want to leave,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.080
then go wash your ass in that river 
and line up for Thorkell.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.540
That's all you need do.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.290
What Thorkell wants is the prince's ass.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.710
Hey, Askeladd.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.090
We've known each other for a long time. 
I don't want to kill you.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.970
Leave the prince here and disappear.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.620
Avalon?

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.000
Is that the name of a place?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.710
SERVANT

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.340
Yes.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.420
It's the name of heaven.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.640
Our great ancestor, King Artorius,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.300
is over there.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.270
But, Mother... King Artorius

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.310
is a general from a long time ago.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.610
Is he still alive?

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.700
Avalon

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.290
lies far across the great sea to the west.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.910
It's a land of everlasting spring, where the fairies live.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.090
It's a place free from the suffering 
of death and old age in this life.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.000
He's recovering

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.800
from his battle wounds there.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.720
Once his wounds have healed, King Artorius

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810
will come back for us.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.730
To save us from our suffering.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.440
When that happens,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.990
serve the king.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.950
He's

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.450
the true king, and a warrior.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.880
Become his staff

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.210
and his sword...

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.130
someday.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.260
Can I talk to you

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.180
before we say goodbye?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.100
It won't change anything.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.650
We've been together for a long time.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.690
We laughed together,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.860
we drank together,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.360
and we made it through hell and back many times.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.790
I've never told you this before.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.920
For the last decade we've spent together...

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.800
I actually

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.970
hated you guys.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.050
-What? 
-What?

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.060
You worthless Danes. You're worse than pigs.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.360
Damn! Get the prince!

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.320
Thorfinn!

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.370
You kids, hold on tight!

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.630
Hurry!

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.460
Damn!

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.960
Damn! They were on to us!

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.470
Follow them! Don't let them get away!

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.970
Go! Go! Go!

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.060
All right! I won't let you!

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.770
The river! Follow the sled! Go!

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.860
My men are impressive. 
They're good at judging the situation.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.700
Very well.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.920
You got me.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.250
It looks like you didn't have enough faith.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.510
They're far away. I can't see them well.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.640
But it looks like they're fighting.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.350
They're fighting amongst themselves.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.480
It happens a lot in times like this.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.440
How pitiful.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520
These days

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.530
everyone's afraid to die.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.240
This is outrageous!

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.200
How dare they start the fight without me?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.120
That's his problem?

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.290
Let me join! Let me join!

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.590
Surround them! Surround them!

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.420
The horses! Kill their horses!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.140
What are you doing? Kill them, Thorfinn!

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.470
Throw your knives!

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.640
Shut up! I'm out of throwing knives!

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.400
Damn! Askeladd's not here yet!

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.150
What is that baldy doing?

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.400
Stop, Bjorn! Listen to us!

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.740
You think I'm stupid enough to actually stop?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.910
Don't forget who I am!

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.790
Think about it, Bjorn! Whether we live or die

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.540
all depends on what we do with the prince!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.010
It's no use, Atli! Bjorn obeys Askeladd completely.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.590
We can't convince him.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.300
We'll just have to kill him!

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.180
Yeah. Looks like you do understand.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.180
Askeladd trusts me. 
That's why he left the prince with me.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.680
If you want to take the prince from me,

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.850
prepare to die!

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.690
You cowards!

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.110
Hey! I told you to attack me!

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.360
Not the horses! No! Hey!

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.700
We're going to crash!

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.720
-Hey! Thorfinn's running away! 
-Don't worry about him. Forget it.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.560
Hey, prince. Are you alive?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.400
Don't be so reckless!

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.650
Prince! Hey!

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.780
He's alive.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.900
All right! Let's go back.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.700
You're not going anywhere yet,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.870
you losers!

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.630
You're still alive, Bjorn?

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.500
What? That mushroom!

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.340
Come at me, all of you at once!

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.180
I'll take you all to Valhalla!

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.730
Damn! Damn! Damn!

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.440
You put me through so much trouble! You baldy!

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.940
You better not die until I kill you,

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.570
Askeladd!

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.540
Oh, dear.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.080
I don't like getting old.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.500
Who ever thought

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:38.010
that I'd be unable to escape 
from a mere 50 men one day?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.410
Wait for it.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.120
Wait for your chance to escape.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.970
Thorkell's going to get here soon.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.600
It's going to be chaos.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.900
You bastard!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.830
Did you see that?

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.040
I saw it.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.370
He cut through his helmet.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.710
Not even my ax can cut like that.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:54.630
Damn. He's good.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.050
Damn. I shouldn't have lost my temper.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.100
Oh, sorry I was being loud.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.640
All right. Come on.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.600
I'm not mad anymore.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.160
Everyone to the east, stand back! 
You're going to get hit by the stray arrows!

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.620
They took out their flying toys.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.710
Torgrim.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.500
Are you the one in charge?

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.340
So what if I am? You bastard.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.760
Are you sure you're okay with this? 
Even I would die from that.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.590
Who cares?

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.140
Bjorn and Thorfinn are good.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.140
They'll kill you if you go after them.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.730
If you want to get the prince,

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.560
you'll need me.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.940
If you take me hostage,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.940
then Bjorn will come back to exchange me for the prince.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.490
That's only if I'm still alive, though.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.950
What are you going to do, Torgrim?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.250
Aim for his legs.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.250
Yeah!

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.960
We did it!

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.310
You're not acting like yourself, Askeladd.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.980
You were never this desperate.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.570
Normally, you'd avoid fighting 
worthless battles.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.280
Why do you risk your life for that coward of a prince?

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.370
Do you plan on taking your prize to the grave with you?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.710
I'm already old.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.180
I don't have a lot of time left 
where I can still work.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.600
I just...

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.600
couldn't wait any longer.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.060
I couldn't wait anymore

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.030
for the true king to return from Avalon.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.590
You don't make any sense.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.470
That's enough. Finish him.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.260
Hey! What's wrong?

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.070
Hey! Are you having fun, guys?

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.030
Which one is Askeladd? Your leader.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.990
I can't wait to meet him.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.620
Too bad.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.920
I don't see anyone without an appointment.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.320
You really are big.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.200
Now that I've seen you up close.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.080
I'm Torgrim.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.000
I'm not going to resist. I just want you to listen.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.720
Captain. The prince isn't here.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.680
Oh, that's right!

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.980
That's what I was going to talk to you about.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.980
We were planning to give you the prince.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.650
But our leader Askeladd let him get away.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.360
But don't worry.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.370
We sent ten men after him.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.120
Just leave it to us.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.120
I swear in the name of Odin. 
We'll get him back, no matter what.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.710
We also have other aces up our sleeve.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.880
What? Wait... Hey!

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.100
So, you're Askeladd.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.600
You look pretty smart.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.060
By the way,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.190
I don't see Thorfinn around.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.020
Did you kill him?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.030
I didn't kill him.

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:15.320
I asked him to guard the prince.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.240
He's not part of this rebellion.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.330
I see! I'm relieved to hear that.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.460
All right! Thanks for waiting, you dogs!

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.720
Except for Askeladd,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.510
kill them all!

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.520
This wasn't part of the deal, Torgrim!

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.860
Hey, you guys.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.690
Pick up your weapons. Act like a warrior 
for your final moments.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.990
Hurry up. Pick it up.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.830
I'm saying this for your own good.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.870
You won't be able to go to Valhalla if you die 
without a weapon.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.630
Damn it all!

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.520
Great. This is how it's supposed to be.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.400
Wait! Wait, Thorkell!

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.860
Are you sure? Are you sure about this?

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.900
If you kill us, you won't be able to get the prince!

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.320
Yeah. That's okay. I'll get him myself.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.790
Hey. It's your ax.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.960
Attack me!

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.460
If you call yourself a warrior, then try feeling good 
when you die.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:02.010
One, two, three, four. 
Two, two, three, four...

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.640
I feel your pain, Torgrim.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.600
-My heart-- 
-Silence!

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.690
It's all your fault!

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.480
Just give up, Torgrim.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.440
You're going to die now.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.860
You're going to die without a doubt.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.580
So, die while fighting. Okay?

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.790
I'll help you.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:33.630
Now then! Attack me! Come on!

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.590
Hey!

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.520
This is no good!

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.110
Looks like I put too much pressure on you.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.950
This is no good.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.990
He's gone now.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.410
Hello?

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.260
What's that?

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.650
Thorfinn!

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.640
Hey! Thorfinn! 
You look like you've been doing well!

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.690
Don't touch Askeladd!

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.440
He's my catch!

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.820
If you lay even one finger on him, I'm going to kill you!

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.820
Got it, big guy? If you touch him, I'm going to kill you!

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.160
I... I always knew you were crazy, but...

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.370
A mouse is picking a fight with a bear.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.170
Your catch?

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.670
He's your boss, right?

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.680
He's not my boss!

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.180
What? What the heck?

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.060
Did you hear that? That kid said 
he's going to kill our captain.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.940
Oh, he has a lot of guts to say that.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.570
Give me Askeladd.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.780
If you don't, I'm going to kill you.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.650
Really?

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.410
Then I'm not going to.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.280
Did you hear that?

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.660
Thorfinn and I just agreed

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.410
to a duel over Askeladd!

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.920
You guys are the witnesses!

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.380
Yeah!

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.130
You did it!

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.430
That bastard... How dare he...

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.680
Yeah! You can do it!

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.480
Thorfinn.

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.690
If you win, I'll let him go.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.230
I'll even give you a horse.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.360
This time isn't going to be like in London.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:53.410
Oh, I'm looking forward to that,

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.290
son of Thors!

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.800
The last in a line of warriors!
