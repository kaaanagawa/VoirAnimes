00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.950
NORTHERN ENGLAND EARLDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA 
VIKINGS' BASE

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.290
It was a Saturday.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.870
Vikings bathe on Saturdays.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.880
The English knew about this custom.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.980
Enemy attack.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.570
Burn them all.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.280
Don't spare the women or children.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.570
Kill them all. Those are the king's orders.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.510
SWORD

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.050
Hang in there. This is it.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.180
Yeah.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.390
I killed Snorre.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.690
Damn.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.310
All right. Spear troops, advance.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.230
Charge.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.490
The battlefield went that way.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.750
Why do I always get killed so fast?

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.790
Dead men aren't supposed to talk, Thorfinn.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.050
You're always the first one to die, Faxi.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.420
Yeah.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.430
In Valhalla, in heaven, 
you get to eat meat every day.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.640
You can't enter Valhalla 
unless you're a strong warrior.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.140
I see.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.610
I wonder if my mother and my sister 
will get into Valhalla.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.450
Did they kill you, Thorfinn?

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.160
If you die in the snow, you'll catch a cold.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.670
You're leaving tomorrow?

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.670
You're so lucky. Where are you going this time?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.460
To Norway. I'm not going there for fun.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.420
I'm going to trade goods.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.180
I take wool and fur, and trade it for wine.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.930
Then I'm going too.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.100
No. What do you mean, "then"? 
Don't say it so casually.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.890
What? You're so stingy.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.400
I don't care if you end up hitting an ice floe.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.070
I want to get some wine before the end of the year.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.780
I'm going to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.160
with the people of my home country 
with some wine.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.040
My father likes mead.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.290
Ask him for some.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.250
It has to be wine.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.710
I thought there'd be some wine in this village, though.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.720
Thorfinn.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.430
Can you pass on a message to your father for me?

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.430
What?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.680
A warship has come.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.820
How's this, master?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.820
The leak's been fixed this time.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.740
Try putting some water in it.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.210
This is difficult.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.500
You put too much strength into it, Thors.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.880
Father.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.710
Father.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.380
I'm over here, Thorfinn.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.010
Father.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.390
Another warship came. It's huge.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.070
They asked for Thors the Troll. 
They've been waiting there ever since.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.530
Thors? Are they talking about Thors?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.660
Troll?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.710
They're no amateurs.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.040
They're not like Halfdan's thugs.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.050
Oh, Thors.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.800
Are they planning to invade this village?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.640
Jomsvikings.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.560
I'm right here.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.320
They're bowing to Thors.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.450
I never imagined you'd come this far looking for me.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.780
Floki.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.540
We haven't seen each other 
since the Norway campaign, Thors.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.920
I never imagined you'd be hiding here, 
at the end of the earth.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.090
Tell me your business, Floki.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.970
Well, then. First give us your permission to land.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.350
Who is Thors?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.310
I heard he used to work on the battlefield 
when he was young.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.400
They'll hear you, Ari.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.360
He doesn't talk about himself much.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.650
Let me see.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.820
He said "Jomsvikings," right?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.030
Know anything about them?

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.200
Not really...

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.700
Father is angry.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.710
They made a surprise attack while they were bathing.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:47.630
Many Danes were killed 
by English troops in Danelaw.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.090
Gunhilde,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.970
the sister of Sweyn,

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.680
the King of Denmark, was one of the victims.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.180
Revenge for his sister.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.770
King Sweyn has a good excuse now.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.860
A big war is about to begin.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.070
It's time for us warriors to shine.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.780
-War? 
-Quiet.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.450
The Jomsvikings will join the army of Denmark.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.700
Our invasion of England will begin 
this coming spring.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.080
Do what you will.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.960
This is a small village 
at the northern edge of the world.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.250
Whatever these big countries on the other side 
of the North Sea decide, it's none of my business.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.920
That will not do.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.640
Our leader Sigvaldi ordered me 
to gather the entire fleet at Jomsborg.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.100
No exceptions.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.060
Do you understand?

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.390
Even if that man deserted the army.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.400
Deserted?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.030
Captain of the Jomsvikings.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.610
Thors the Troll.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.990
This is a war...

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.000
in which you too will fight.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.010
Thors.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.310
Our leader is doing this out of his own goodwill.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.350
After going missing 15 years ago,

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.150
you have a chance 
to return to the battlefield with honor.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.900
Our leader is willing to overlook everything.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.950
That's how much our leader wants you.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.160
You didn't have to come on a warship 
just to tell me that.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.080
The villagers are afraid.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.040
You've changed a lot, Thors.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.340
Or did this village change you?

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.170
-Run away. 
-Run away.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.090
He's scary.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:01.010
This is a nice village.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.060
I can tell from the children.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.270
They've lived a life free from war, until today.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.690
Hear that? There's going to be a war.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.650
-Wow. 
-This is my first war.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.280
He came all the way across the ocean to invite Thors.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.040
Your father is amazing.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.420
But I wonder if he'd take us with him.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.420
You have no chance. You're weak.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.090
-What are you talking about? 
-You're no good unless you're strong.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.880
Well, I got that covered.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.800
You've never killed anyone, right?

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.140
It all depends on whether 
you've had that experience or not.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.180
Sorry.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.360
I'm not just...

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.070
a powerless messenger, you know.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.240
If you're saying you're not going to fight in the war,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.660
I can't carry out my master's orders, 
and our leader's reputation would be damaged.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.120
I can't go back empty-handed in a situation like that.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.920
You understand, don't you?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.890
The Jomsvikings.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.850
They're an army with a base in Jomsborg,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.770
a port town in Wendland.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.940
I never imagined

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.820
that Thors used to be a Jomsviking.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.570
Are they strong?

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.780
They're strong.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.410
They're so strong

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:45.490
that the King of Wendland was unable 
to collect taxes from them.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.290
They take pride in being the strongest army 
in the Northern Sea.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.040
Withdraw. All troops, return to the ship.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.790
Withdraw.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.760
What was that just now? That was weird.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.850
You've been saved, Ari.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.020
Listen, villagers.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.900
I'm Floki of the Jomsvikings.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.820
At the orders of my master,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.320
I have come to this land

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.070
to ask the hero Thors Snorresson to join our forces.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.820
Hero?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.660
Our leader has requested

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.000
that Thors be provided with one warship.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.130
If you have what it takes,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.670
join Thors and come with us to Jomsborg.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.310
Farewell, Thors.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.890
We shall meet on the battlefield.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.320
We're going to war.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.410
-How many decades has it been? 
-What?

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.160
I'm going to kill them all.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.950
It'll be an honor to die on the battlefield.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.120
Let's get started right away. 
Let's prepare the ships tomorrow.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.920
I guess you couldn't say no, Thors.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.180
I dragged the village into this.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.310
A long time ago,

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.270
I used to earn my living by killing people.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.520
But one day...

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.360
One day, I suddenly hated it all.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.480
I didn't want to kill

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.400
or be killed.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.110
That's why I ran away

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.280
from the battlefield.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.000
I thought I succeeded in making it look like I died.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.170
You could do that again.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.840
If I run away, this village will be punished in my place.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.010
The Jomsvikings never forgive deserters.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.650
The time has come

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.150
for me to take responsibility 
for what I've done.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.700
All right. Ready?

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.790
One, two...

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.910
Heave, ho.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.660
Heave, ho.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.290
Pull.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.250
Heave, ho.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.300
What? I thought you were leaving today, Leif.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.670
Thors asked me.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.470
I decided to join the fleet with that warship.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.680
I see.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.800
That would be safer.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.310
We'll protect you in a pinch.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.890
Here we go.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.940
I'm counting on you.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.730
Pull. Pull.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.070
Heave, ho.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.860
Though,

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.280
everyone really does love war.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.290
You're so mean.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.580
Darn you, Thorfinn.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.080
Surround him.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.540
Bastard.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.760
We did it. I killed Thorfinn.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:28.880
That hurt.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.930
What's wrong with you? Die, Thorfinn. 
You got killed just now.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.600
Follow the rules.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.680
That's right.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.350
What's wrong with you?

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.560
Are you okay?

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.440
Wait, Thorfinn.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.070
All right. Lift.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.570
One, two, three.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.830
All right. One more time.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.500
Thors.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.830
Can you take a look at this?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.090
The pain.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.840
It's broken.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.010
Someone hit too hard. 
It's supposed to be a game.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.430
Keep the splint on for one month.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.840
Sorry, Thors.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.430
Thorfinn did it.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.600
He pisses me off.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.930
He's too rough.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.890
I'm never playing with him again.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.650
Is that true? My son did this?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.360
Yes.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.780
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.400
I'll talk to him about this.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.860
Don't take it so seriously.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.280
It's between the kids.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.950
He's only 6, right?

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.870
If he can hurt kids 
that are four or five years older than him,

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.160
he must be pretty strong.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:44.000
He'll grow up to be a good fighter.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.130
He takes after you, Thors.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.350
You're giving me all of this, Dad?

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.520
They're family treasures from my grandfather.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.440
Fight with all your might.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520
Ari.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.110
You look good, Ari.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.780
Look at mine.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.280
It can cut off a horse's head in one stroke.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.820
Wow, it's huge.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.620
Spears are what's best for plundering.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.410
Really? Want to have a match?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.210
What's wrong with you?

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.840
Don't throw everything on the floor.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.420
Hey. Are you listening to me?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.590
I'm going to throw it away 
if you don't pick it up. Got it?

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.680
Go ahead. I don't want it anymore.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.470
What are you doing, 
searching through the storage room?

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.140
Where are our weapons?

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.770
What? Weapons?

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.270
I need a weapon.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.770
If I had a weapon...

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:51.940
Are you thinking...

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.110
you're going to become a warrior 
and sail on your father's ship?

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.820
I'm telling you now, 
don't waste your time trying.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.790
A little kid like you can't do it.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.210
Thorfinn.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.170
It's beautiful.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.230
What is it? What's wrong, Ylva?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.940
Do you want a sword, Thorfinn?

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.570
A sword is a tool for killing people.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.870
Who were you planning to kill with this?

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.790
The... The enemy.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.710
Who is your enemy?

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.040
Like...

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.210
Halfdan.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.630
Listen closely, Thorfinn.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.520
You don't have any enemies.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.440
No one has any enemies.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.410
There's no one who it's okay to hurt.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.200
You're wrong.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.710
Father, you're going off to war tomorrow.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.170
You're going to kill the enemy, right?

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.710
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.090
You're lying, Father.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.890
I can tell.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.140
Thorfinn.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.350
Thorfinn.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.100
-You let your guard down. 
-That was dangerous.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.270
Hey.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.810
You made me bleed.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:42.820
Helga.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.950
Yes?

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.740
Take care of him for me.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.640
The wind blows faintly from the west north-west.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.310
The waves are calm.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.150
Odin is in good spirits this morning.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.730
This is a good morning for your departure.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.900
Indeed.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.000
FAROE ISLANDS 
STREYMOY

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.500
You said it.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.090
If I throw left-handed and hit it, 
the barrel is mine.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.000
-No way. 
-You can talk after you hit it.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.090
I beg you, God...

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.550
Here I go, Christian monk.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.590
If you dodge, I'll kill you.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.020
You bastard. You dodged. 
You dodged just now. I'm going to kill you.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.480
Move. It's my turn.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.070
Oh, no. The priest...

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.190
I told you not to dodge.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.490
You're just bad.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.280
Hey, Jomsvikings.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.240
Want to have a drink?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.080
They have good manners.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.290
Leave them alone.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.750
They said they don't like cheap alcohol.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:23.000
Hey.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.430
How many points do I get for his leg?

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.510
Your men don't have any class, Askeladd.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.060
We just hate Christians, Floki.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.270
Enough about that. Let's get down to business.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.820
My men and I are bored of being kept here waiting 
in the middle of nowhere.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.580
There are no major changes.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.910
You will be compensated with five pounds of gold.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.420
I will only pay you in exchange for his dead body.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.340
You can do whatever you want with their ship, 
and their cargo.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.470
Kill Thors.
