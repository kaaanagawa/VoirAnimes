WEBVTT

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.350
A TRUE WARRIOR

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.580
Don't get cocky.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.560
Who is he?

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.780
He's coming.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.240
What are we going to do, Bjorn?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.240
This is bad. Bjorn's gone mad.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.910
Stop him. He'll destroy the ship.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.290
You're crazy.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.920
How are we supposed to stop a monster like that?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.790
Run. No one can stop him now.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.970
He's eaten a berserker mushroom.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.550
All with his bare hands...

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.260
He's stronger than a monster.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.970
The Troll of Jom.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.350
All right. One more ship.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.320
They're here.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.620
-What are we going to do? 
-Surrender?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.290
Damn it. Come on.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.620
I'd rather die fighting than be a slave.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.880
Listen. Capture the kids alive.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.630
If they get hurt, they won't sell for a high price. 
Be careful.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.520
We're going to have some fun with you.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.030
Bjorn?

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.290
Thors.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.970
Listen. You've already lost half of your forces.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.640
Leave now, and I won't take your life.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.740
Be gone, pirates.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.820
You cannot defeat me.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.450
-That bastard. 
-Stop.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.700
Don't shoot until Askeladd gives the signal.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.750
What are they doing?

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.670
We've got the high ground.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.590
What are they stalling for?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.590
What a crazy man.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.590
He's not afraid to take on two whole warships alone.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.680
Let's fight too.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.560
Fool. You amateurs will make things worse.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.890
Their archers are waiting up on the cliff.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.560
He's the one who knows how to handle this.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.570
But...

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.190
Don't you understand?

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.820
Except for Thors,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.280
we're just a bunch of kids and amateurs.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.160
All we can do is let him handle this.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.540
It looks like they're not 
the type of men to leave when I say so.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.050
The archers up on the cliff aren't firing yet.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.760
There's 30 men to the front.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.300
I know I could kill that many myself.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.300
But our ships are close.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.180
If they all jumped over to our ship, 
it'd be a free-for-all.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.640
I'd be fine if I was alone, but...

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.620
Are you the leader?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.990
In the name of Odin, the Almighty,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.080
I challenge you to a duel.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.170
If you win, you can do whatever you want.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.210
If I win, you must withdraw at once.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.880
If you refuse,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.970
then you're going to lose three times as many men

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.680
to capture a mere 12 slaves.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.310
Can I ask you something?

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.520
Why do you think I'm their leader?

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.610
I can smell it.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.780
Impressive.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.950
All right. I accept the duel.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.290
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf, swear in the name of Odin.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.040
Stay back near the ship's bow.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.540
Okay.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.860
I too

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.730
can smell something about you.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.110
You have the same smell as me,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.660
Troll of Jom.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.280
He knows who I am?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.870
Did Floki do this?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.750
You're quick. I like smart men.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.420
My father isn't a bad man like you.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.840
Hey. Stay back.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.930
My father is strong. Die, you pirate.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.090
You idiot. You idiot. Your armor looks weird.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.140
What an energetic boy. Is that your son?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.430
Stop. You fool.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.400
Askeladd. Do you have a wife and children?

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.940
No.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.690
I see.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400
Let's begin.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.960
He's closing up the distance carelessly.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.990
Too shallow.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.830
You're amazing.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.460
No one can beat Askeladd.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.670
Father.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.220
He dodged it. My moment of opportunity...

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.310
A surprise attack won't work on him anymore.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.980
Coming all this way was worth it.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.190
He's an incredible man.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.190
Thors...

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:57.860
You're strong.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.620
Forgive me, Askeladd.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.870
I can't go easy on you.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.870
I'm happy to hear that, Thors.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.220
What?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.390
Hey, hey.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.320
Amazing. It's a one-sided fight.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.000
Askeladd is in trouble.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.460
But he's able to block all his attacks.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.960
Father. Kill him.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.260
Oh, no.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.140
He's going after my sword. It won't hold up for long.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.140
That must mean...

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.600
His sword is also...

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.980
This is it.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.740
Since I know his target,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.450
I can predict the arc of his sword.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.450
This is it. A wide swing.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.420
I fell for his trap.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.380
He was waiting for me to get careless, 
and swing wide.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.300
He was planning to have me snap his sword, 
all along.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.630
Everything went according to his plan.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.510
Unbelievable.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.430
I can't believe I fell for it.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.520
You did it.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.140
-Thors. You did it. 
-That was amazing, Father.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.520
You won.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.400
What's wrong? Kill me.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.360
I don't need to.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.530
Say you surrender. That's enough for me.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.540
I'm their leader.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.540
I can't say that in front of my men.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.800
What's wrong? Kill me.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.640
If you don't kill me,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.850
this duel will never end.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.980
Ouch, my head hurts.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.950
What? What's going on?

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.500
Askeladd...

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.580
Defeat?

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.880
He lost?

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.840
Admit it. I won this duel.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.510
Withdraw your troops at once.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.760
You really are strong, Thors.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.890
You could lead a whole army.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.020
But why?

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.150
Why did you stay in Iceland for 15 years, 
even though you're such a strong warrior?

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.780
Don't you think you're wasting your skills?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.280
No.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.240
I must rely on a sword like this,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.290
because I am not yet a master.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.750
A true warrior

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.460
doesn't need a sword.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.180
Thors, you...

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.680
Why don't you become our leader?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.210
Just kidding. Hey, hey.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.710
Why isn't anyone laughing? I was just joking.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.340
What? He was joking?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.970
This is no time for...

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.970
joking around with a straight face.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.350
Don't move.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.770
I'll cut the kid's head off.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.110
Let go of your sword.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.900
Hurry up.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.240
Askeladd. You bastard.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.490
Father.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.870
Come on. You're such a good man.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.380
Did you think we were going 
to follow the rules of the duel?

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.300
I was just playing around with you.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.930
I wanted to find out 
how good the famous Troll of Jom really was.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.680
I had a good time.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.200
Askeladd.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.830
You broke the rules of the duel.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.710
I won this match.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.050
Who cares?

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.550
I'm after your head.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.680
I know.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.200
I accept.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.370
The winner of this duel...

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.870
is you.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.550
Father!

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.400
Father...

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.570
Askeladd.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.950
I won this duel.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.580
Keep the promise you made as a warrior.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.920
I know.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.790
In the name of my ancestor Artorius,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.670
I shall withdraw my troops at once.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.930
Leif. I have a favor to ask you.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.640
Bring my head to Sigvaldi,

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.940
the leader of the Jomsvikings.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.440
If he suspects that I disappeared 
to avoid his summons,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.820
he'll take his revenge by punishing the village.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.700
You're a crazy man.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.370
You bastard.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.830
I'll give you my life. Just like you wanted.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.840
Let that child go right now.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.260
Father. Father.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.650
I'm glad.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.320
For now...

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.470
Damn kid.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.600
You should start valuing your life.

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:47.850
You should be grateful to Thors.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.900
He was a man who was worth more 
than a hundred bratty kids like you.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.450
Father died.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.920
Father was so strong.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.670
Why did he let go of his sword?

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.550
How could he say a warrior doesn't need a sword?

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.550
That can't be true.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.720
Why...?

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.520
Why did Father...?

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.600
Damn.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.440
He...

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.810
He lost to Father.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.780
Damn it.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.940
Why was my father the one who died?

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.320
Why is he the one who's still alive?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.320
Damn it.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.160
Damn it all.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.800
I'm surprised they abandoned these nice ships.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.960
It must have been a big decision.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.340
They can't move the ship without Thors.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.140
Thors could row as hard as five men.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.550
Really?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.690
Things worked out well.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.520
I was wanting to get a third ship.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.610
Twenty-eight men injured.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:25.530
How many died?

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:29.870
None? Not even one? Impossible.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.830
Askeladd.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.420
Hey.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.130
Come to the stern. Askeladd.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.710
What do you want? Shut up already.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.390
It's Thors' kid.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.770
He was hiding inside the ship.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.060
Look at him. The kid's got a dagger.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.690
He's going to kill us.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.530
Oh, no. I'm so scared.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.290
How dare you...?

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.830
How dare you...?

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.290
How dare you kill Father?

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.130
I'm going to kill you.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.460
I'm going to kill you, no matter what.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.180
I'm going to kill you!

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.810
I'm going to kill you!

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:36.930
He's just a kid.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.560
But that look in his eyes...

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.780
What do you want to do, Askeladd?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.570
Shall we throw him overboard?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.950
Leave him.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.990
He will die soon anyway.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.090
Father...
