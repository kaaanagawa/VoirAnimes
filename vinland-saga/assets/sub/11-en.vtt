WEBVTT

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030
I'm so cold.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.610
Got any booze?

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.920
A Gamble

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.040
It's already autumn.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.760
Everything tastes good in autumn.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.470
Especially fish. Cod, trout, and herring!

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.720
The pigs and sheep fatten up too, captain.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.850
That's right. It's great.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.440
I want some salted sausage 
with some dark beer!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.270
Give me some.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.020
At first, I thought it was weird.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.860
But I got used to English beer.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.610
I like cheese with my beer.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.120
Cheddar had great cheese.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.740
Enough about food. 
It's all about the women!

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.370
The women here are so classy. 
They're exactly my type!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.250
I know what you mean! They've got modesty.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.540
YOU MUST NOT COMMIT ADULTERY

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.380
Maybe it's because they're Christian.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.170
Christianity is nice.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.130
It's popular these days. Maybe I should convert.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.890
I don't want to convert.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.810
If you're Christian, they're always telling 
you not to do this or that.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.140
I saw a statue of the guy they worship 
in London.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.900
He looked so weak.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.020
-You'll get punished for saying that! 
-Yeah!

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.650
He's so skinny.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.910
Thor could knock him out with his hammer 
in an instant!

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.160
I heard he's a magician.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.040
He does things like walking on water 
and making more bread appear.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.290
That's some lame magic.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.920
Odin and Thor are better.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.630
Well, well.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.090
There's no need to jump to conclusions.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.550
Let's ask a Christian directly.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.430
Hey!

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.310
Prince!

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.390
Who do you think is better?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.810
Jesus, or the gods in Asgard?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.190
Well?

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.570
I wonder what's wrong?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.070
Are you too shy to talk in front of everyone?

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.830
Don't get so full of yourself, Thorkell!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.830
You infidel!

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.120
Do you understand what you're doing?

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.460
How dare you talk to 
His Highness Canute with such impudence?

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.510
Well,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.090
I don't like taking hostages either.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.300
But...

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.930
King Sweyn is ignoring me.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.560
So, I thought maybe he'd notice me 
if I captured the prince.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.070
I wish you'd try and understand how hurt I feel.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.440
Captain! You sound like a maiden in love.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.400
Yes!

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.990
That's exactly it!

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.410
I've fallen for King Sweyn.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.200
You're huge for a girl.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.450
You're the king of the Northern Sea, 
after all!

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.960
You really fell for him.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.630
You guys are all crazy.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.880
You know nothing but war.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.510
You're all going to die.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.840
How can 500 men

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.680
defeat the Army of Denmark 
and its 16,000 soldiers?

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.060
We're not going to die.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.020
And we won't have a problem winning, Ragnar.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.230
You've been under the influence of Christianity 
for a long time.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.480
Have you forgotten about...

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.650
the honor of

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.700
a Norman warrior?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.370
You mean Valhalla?

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.620
That's right.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.620
The Valkyries

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.750
are always on the lookout 
for the souls of heroes.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.880
Heroes who deserve to be called 
Einherjar, the warriors of the gods.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.760
Only those who have fought

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.930
and died

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.010
are allowed to live in the hall of warriors 
in heaven.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.690
It's how you fight,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.940
and how you die.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.480
That's what matters.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.900
The stronger the enemy, the better.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.320
You're so old-fashioned.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.570
Is that so?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.200
It's because you're always running around 
from battlefield to battlefield.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.950
You poor thing.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.710
You're just a child, Thorkell.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.170
You don't know anything

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.420
about the royal court,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.760
about King Sweyn,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.840
or about my prince, Canute.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.220
So?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.260
What do you mean?

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.480
I can see him!

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.980
Lord! It's you!

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.020
-He's out of booze! 
-I'm your disciple!

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.360
-I'm right here! 
-Priest! Priest!

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.400
Please sit down!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.240
Get him some booze!

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.740
-Open my eyes! 
-Hurry!

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.570
Get him something strong!

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.410
Show me your love!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.830
It's always so funny!

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.460
Incredible! It must be hard being Christian!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.880
Hey!

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.090
Priest!

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.180
What do you think?

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.010
Jesus, or our god?

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.470
Which one's better?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.850
Whichever one made booze.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.650
You're right!

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.650
The booze will save us!

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.030
Nice one, Christian!

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.750
What's wrong?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.800
Why did you all stop?

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.220
Captain.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.600
Right.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.310
Right about there!

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.740
There they are!

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.650
It's an ambush! The hill on the right!

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.240
Damn!

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.620
Thorkell!

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.450
We've got you surrounded!

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.210
We're Ragnar's troops, under Prince Canute! 
We're 2000 strong!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.960
It's my men!

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.960
Two thousand strong?

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.010
It's usually a bluff when they announce it themselves.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.970
Hey.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.220
Yeah, I know.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.890
This is your last chance, you rebels.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.100
Release His Highness and Ragnar at once!

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.600
If you do, we shall spare you this time.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.610
Think carefully about where you stand!

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.150
You scoundrels...

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.320
You have no...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.610
No...

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.610
choice...

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.830
Your Highness!

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.370
Ragnar!

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.750
Good. Very good.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.000
You're more honest than I thought.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.750
Followers of Ragnar!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.500
Thanks for your hard work.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.420
I will return His Highness

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.380
Canute to you!

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.390
There's no need to hesitate.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.010
Now then...

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.520
show us your best attack!

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.770
What?

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:26.850
You bastard!

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.020
Stop.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.530
Control yourself.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.150
We retreat!

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.160
But there's no need to retreat as a warrior!

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.410
They're not running away,

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.580
and they don't fear imprisonment.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.910
If we retreat now...

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.540
If we retreat now,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.920
we'd be called cowards.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.000
There is a reason for retreat.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.630
We must prioritize His Highness' safety!

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.050
Victory means saving His Highness!

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.180
Hey! What's wrong, guys?

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.980
Are you scared? Even with 2000?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.190
Or is it something else?

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.110
"We had to hold back because they had a hostage."

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.530
Would it be easier

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.190
to use an excuse like that?

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.030
You bastard!

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.360
How dare you?

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.030
Stop!

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.580
Didn't you hear my order?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.460
Don't let those war-hungry idiots provoke you!

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.920
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.960
Was what I said...

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.130
the truth?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.630
How dare you?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.720
I'm sending you all to Valhalla!

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.390
If you can,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.220
be my guest!

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.440
Movement.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.440
They've started.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.900
Anyone could hear that.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.780
The wind's good.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.200
All right! Men!

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.450
Let's do this just like we planned!

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.580
Yeah!

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.140
You idiots! Protect His Highness!

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.650
This is turning out 
the same way London did!

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.560
Retreat!

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.400
There's still time!

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.070
Two thousand? 
What are they talking about?

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.450
They only have 400 max.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.000
This will be over in half an hour.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.290
What's wrong, captain?

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.630
Don't you smell something?

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.670
Something other than blood.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.550
You're right.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.850
I can't smell anything.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.850
It's the smell of intestines?

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.850
No.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.480
It's upwind.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.350
The smell of charcoal.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.740
Charcoal?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Hey! Get me some oil!

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.920
Don't be so slow!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Hurry!

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.670
All right! That's good!

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.920
Light it!

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.520
This is bad.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.320
Captain! Where are you?

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:02.690
Right here.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.820
We're in trouble.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.160
We're in the middle of an inferno!

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.450
With all this smoke, we can't tell who's who.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.830
We can't fight like this.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.790
It's better downwind.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:14.710
Let's go.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.210
Dying in a forest fire won't get you to Valhalla.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.170
This isn't a forest fire.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.510
Someone set it on fire.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.180
It wasn't them.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.140
They wouldn't burn themselves 
when they're here trying to save the prince.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.440
That means...

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.190
A third party...

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.490
is involved.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.740
It's burning.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.580
It hasn't rained in a few days.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.000
Horrible.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.870
There's a lot of ways to die.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.630
But I wouldn't want to die like that.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.090
Exactly.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.510
It's a painful and boring way to die.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.340
It'd help us out a lot if Thorkell died in this fire.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.260
That monster would never die from a tiny fire like this.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.560
I just want to confuse them for a while.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.520
Thorfinn!

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.430
All right!

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.520
Pour some water on him!

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.360
You saw the prince from far away, right?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.530
He has a helmet with a feather and red cape.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.570
Don't get it wrong.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.990
All right. Go!

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.630
Hey, Askeladd.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.800
Maybe we should have joined Ragnar's 400 men.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.810
Combined with our 100, we'd be even against Thorkell.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.970
We can't win being even.

00:14:56.890 --> 00:14:58.520
Even if we won,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.480
Ragnar's men would take the prize.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.820
-It's a deer! 
-It's all or nothing.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.770
Get it!

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.780
-Even if we end up burning Canute, 
-It's venison!

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.780
we'll just pretend we don't know anything.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.870
No one would ever find out we did it.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.580
That's what you say.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.170
You just think that Thorfinn can capture 
the prince, right?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.130
Regardless of what you say,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.250
you actually trust him.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.590
That boy.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.220
It's just easy to make use of

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.260
an idiot who's not afraid of anything.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.150
What's going on?

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.400
Thorkell's not the one who did this.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.150
In any case, we must escape!

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.030
Your Highness! Hurry!

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.540
Ragnar!

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.000
Idiot!

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.920
What kind of man swings his sword without 
seeing who he's attacking?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.130
Sorry.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.380
I was scared.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.800
What if you injured His Highness?

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.380
You fool!

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.930
Your Highness!

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.390
Ragnar!

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.470
Where are you?

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.100
See?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.850
Smart men check first, just like that.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.560
I apologize, sir.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.360
Hey!

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.230
His Highness is over here!

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.570
Hey!

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.280
We're on the same side!

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.900
Please, just--

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.330
We found Canute!

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.410
-The prize! The prize! 
-The prince is here!

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.830
Over here!

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.040
Damn!

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.670
Damn! You're Thorkell's men!

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.670
I'm the one who's the fool!

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.670
Don't kill the prince!

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.300
I know!

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.090
We have to be careful, right?

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.970
Over here, little boy.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.140
We're nice guys.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.190
That was close!

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.190
A horse?

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.410
Who's this kid?

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.330
Why's he staring at us?

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.700
He looks like he wants to fight.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.540
Are we allowed to kill him?

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.080
Sure. He doesn't look like he's important.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.460
All right. It's decided.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.170
Die, kid!

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.970
He disappeared?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.530
You there.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.900
You're Prince Canute, right?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.240
I've come to save you.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.160
Wait right there.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.120
Impossible.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.130
No one would come here to save the prince!

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.290
But...

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.920
Why?

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.880
Why does His Highness

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.510
never get to choose?

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.270
Thorfinn!

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.310
Hey!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.060
You're Thorfinn, right?

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.990
Well, well!

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.070
It's really you, Thorfinn!

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.070
I knew I'd see you again!

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.080
Thorkell!

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.580
Captain!

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.750
You guys were fighting him?

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.330
He gave you a hard time, right?

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.880
Thorfinn's a great warrior.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.090
He gave me this wound, after all.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.170
Look.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.340
If you underestimate him, you'll get hurt.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.560
Wait, Thorfinn.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.720
There's two things I want to ask you.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.480
You guys are behind this fire, right?

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.230
One more.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.780
You called yourself Thors' son, right?

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.450
Your father's name is Thors.

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.790
And your mother's name is

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.290
Helga.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.540
Am I wrong?

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.250
How do you know that?

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.970
I see, I see!

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.140
So, you're the son of 
the Troll of the Jomsvikings!

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.560
That's why you're strong.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:48.930
The Troll of the Jomsvikings?

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.640
He's Thors' son?

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.400
He doesn't look like him.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.230
You know my father?

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.400
Of course I know him!

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.280
He's the only man in the world

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.160
who's stronger than me.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.790
He's a true warrior.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.290
No!

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.180
That's hot!

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.510
Really hot!

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.020
We don't have time to talk about the past, 
Thorfinn.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.020
I'll give you the prince for now.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:33.730
Let's do this again.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.690
We're headed for the same place anyway.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.780
To King Sweyn's main forces!

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.650
If you're able to escape me,

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.610
you'll be victorious!

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.330
Don't let me down,

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.040
son of Thors!

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:50.910
Thorfinn!

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.540
Oh, dear.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.210
Where's Thorkell?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.170
Captain!

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.550
Your Highness!

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.130
Ragnar!

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.010
You're with the enemy!

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.010
You bastard!

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.470
You're one of Thorkell's men.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.940
Thorfinn's late.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.440
You trusted in his luck

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.450
too much this time.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.700
It doesn't matter.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.490
I didn't lose anything.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:31.120
There's more of them.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.580
Hurry up and take away your dead.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.300
Don't shoot!

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.550
It's me!

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.090
I've brought the prince!

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.560
Yeah!

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.480
Askeladd.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.310
Because of your reckless plan,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.440
my men got scattered.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.360
You'll pay for this dearly.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.410
You would have been destroyed 
by Thorkell anyway.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.490
Be quiet.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.870
However, in this situation,

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.830
I have no choice but to entrust the prince's safety 
to you.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.000
Protect His Highness,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.590
and send the troops to the main army.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.630
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf,

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.720
accept your request.

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:31.470
Therefore,

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.060
as his bodyguard, I would like to 
look upon His Highness' face.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.520
Your Highness...

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.000
Prince?

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.840
Are you sure he's not the princess?
