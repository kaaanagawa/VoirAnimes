WEBVTT

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.020
Come on.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.610
Come on.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.110
Hey. It's a warship.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.070
Tell Gorm. Hurry.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
Wait. Look closely.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.500
They're Askeladd's ships.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.510
We finally made it back to the village.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.720
Well, we survived another year.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.470
And you still haven't died, Bjorn.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.350
We went pretty far.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.270
What?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.350
Hey. It's the sheep. They're still grazing them.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.110
They're trying to fatten them up.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.820
It looks like Gorm's still stingy as usual.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.580
Men.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.620
Thanks for your hard work this year.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.170
Enjoy the winter.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.020
Over there.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.190
NOVEMBER 1012 AD

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.810
FEUDAL LORD GORM'S VILLAGE 
JUTLAND PENINSULA

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.980
There's so much treasure.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.740
They had a huge victory 
in the land of the Franks.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.110
BEYOND THE EDGE OF THE SEA

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.240
I'm impressed, Askeladd.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.660
-I heard some men died this year. 
-Really?

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.370
I wonder if they're going to look for new sailors again.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.000
Damn. I can't wait.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.710
If I'm going to sail, I want to sail with Askeladd.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.960
Idiot. You'd die within three days.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.300
Hey. Say you're sorry.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.900
What's wrong with that kid?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.580
Ready? One, two...

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.200
Askeladd.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.330
Welcome home.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.210
Hey, girls.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.880
You're so cute.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.630
Hey. I brought you some necklaces.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.130
-I'll take it. 
-I want a ring.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.510
Hey, Uncle Gorm.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.520
The girls here aren't modest at all. It's wonderful.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.430
I'm here to talk about a serious matter.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.640
Are you ready to listen?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.100
Listen.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.820
The cost to feed one of your men

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.530
is one and one-fourth silver coins per day.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.490
You have 97 men,

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.740
so that's 121 coins in total--

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.120
You want to talk about money again?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.660
The price of pork increased this year.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.410
If you want to eat pork every day, 
then you would need...

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.750
Beer is charged separately.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.210
And if you add in the cost of lodging and firewood...

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.840
Uncle, stop worrying.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.550
We earned a lot this year.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.430
Give my men plenty of booze and food.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.220
I'll pay.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.970
That's what I was waiting to hear.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
I'll buy you a drink.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.060
Bring the celebratory drinks.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.810
We have some good wine, right? Bring it here.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.400
One, two, three...

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.990
Uncle. Do you really love money so much?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.900
Is there anyone who doesn't?

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.580
Money is great. Just looking at it makes me happy.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.670
Hey, Hordaland. What are you doing?

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.210
Hurry up, and bring the wine.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.380
Yes, sir.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.050
Oh, dear. What a troublesome woman.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.260
What a weird name.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.810
That slave girl. Hordaland?

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.440
-It's the name of a region in Norway. 
-Yeah.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.060
I bought her recently.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.480
She's the daughter of a feudal lord, 
but her family lost a battle, and fell to ruin.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.110
She's a beautiful girl, and she was expensive.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.990
But she's slow at work.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.500
Rich girls are useless. 
They just have a lot of pride.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.580
-By the way, Uncle... 
-What?

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.630
Can I ask you to be my witness?

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.460
I'm scheduled for a duel before dinner.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.510
A duel?

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.840
And...

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.470
It's not the slave's fault that she's useless.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.720
You're just bad at using her.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:34.890
What did you say?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.520
You can make use of anyone...

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.360
with the right approach.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.900
What?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.940
What's going on?

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.530
It's a duel.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.280
You can do it, kid.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.660
Do it. Don't lose to him.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.580
In the name of Odin,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.000
the duel between Thorfinn 
and Askeladd is about to begin.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.380
Each man may choose their own weapon.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.260
If you fight with honor,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.510
your soul shall pass through the gates of Valhalla, 
even if you shall die.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.390
Seriously?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.730
He's one of Askeladd's men?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.350
Maybe he'd let even someone 
like me sail with him too.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.020
-He's kind of cute, right? 
-What?

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.990
Askeladd has more money. And he's strong.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.870
The reason for this duel is for Thorfinn 
to avenge his father's death.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.620
-Are there any objections? 
-No.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.250
No.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.080
Then begin.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:49.630
Unbelievable. Thorfinn's so stubborn.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.800
Go.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:57.060
You can do it.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.600
Do it.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.770
You...

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.810
got taller.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.310
How old are you now?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.820
You were still only this tall back then--

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.990
Thorfinn attacked.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.240
He got up close.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.710
You should go along with making small-talk...

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.580
with old men.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.010
-He got up. 
-He's okay.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.300
He sent him flying with a single hit.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.010
Idiot. Thorfinn jumped.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.890
He knows that the one with the dagger has the advantage 
at close range.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.480
He's stronger now.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.150
-Nice, kid. 
-Askeladd.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.490
Do it.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.410
He's good.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.590
Damn.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.520
Nice.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
Get him.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.850
Hang in there, kid.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:31.860
Hey, Thorfinn.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.570
Your father... What was his name?

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.620
Tho... Tho... Tho...

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.830
It's Thors.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.330
Thors. That's right.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.210
Getting old is making me forgetful.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.380
But you know...

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.020
I know you're in the middle of getting revenge, 
so I feel bad saying this.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.640
I've killed a lot of people, you know.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.520
I can't quite remember your father.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.230
Did I really kill him?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.280
Did I kill Thoril?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.030
Hey. Do you remember how I killed him?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.280
What if...?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.830
Well, maybe you're wrong.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.710
You bastard.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:30.170
If you had fought him with honor,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.920
my father would never have lost to you.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.180
During that fight,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.300
you...

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.480
You took me hostage.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.310
Oh, that's right. I remember now.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.190
He's that idiot who put down his sword 
to save a kid's life.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.750
What did he do just now?

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.470
Don't get so worked up.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.760
You haven't trained enough, kid.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.230
Damn you.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.540
Bjorn. Pick him up.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.660
Sure.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.160
I'm hungry.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.080
Oh, that's right.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.000
Uncle.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.090
I want to eat some lamb breast.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:01.930
Roasted with herbs.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.740
I've been waiting for this.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.960
It's so cold.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.580
Hey. Aren't you supposed to guard the ship?

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.630
I got out of it. Thorfinn said he doesn't want to switch.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.510
You mean he's in a bad mood because he lost?

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.760
He's always been like that.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.010
He feels comfortable there.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.390
It used to be his father's ship.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.940
Just leave him alone.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.320
Not bad.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.530
Askeladd.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.080
Today's duel was amazing.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.580
What? Really?

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.790
You threw him at the end, right?

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.250
How did you do that? That was so cool.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.510
But you know, captain...

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.300
Are you sure about taking a kid 
like him sailing with you?

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.890
What if he attacks you while you sleep?

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.100
I'll be fine.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.470
He could never do it.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.560
What do you mean?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.610
He's a warrior, too, you know.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.360
He'd only accept victory with honor.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:52.200
He's held back by his past, and his pride.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.960
It's you again, Horda.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.210
You're in the way. Clean it up. Hurry.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.470
You're not a noblewoman anymore.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.890
Stand up, you clumsy girl.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.970
I don't get it.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.720
If I had to live without pride,

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.140
I'd rather kill myself.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.110
What's wrong? Did I say something funny?

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.980
No. It's not you.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.700
Look.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.990
It's terrible.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.080
Don't forget, you're just a slave.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.250
The guy who's a slave to money holds a whip,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.290
and pretends to be the master 
of the slave he bought with his money.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.960
He just doesn't realize it himself.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.260
Everyone is a slave to something.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.570
You upset?

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.700
Father.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.180
Hey. Crybaby.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.860
Does it hurt, kid?

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.610
Do you want to get revenge?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.660
Well, you're my son.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.080
If I told you not to seek revenge, you wouldn't listen.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.500
This is a problem.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.340
I don't know what to say.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.970
Maybe you'll just have to realize it on your own.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.680
I told you, right?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.720
You don't have any enemies.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.140
No one has any enemies.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.610
A true warrior doesn't need a sword...

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.090
Master Gorm told me

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.180
to bring you some food.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.580
Hey. Are you a slave too?

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.870
What?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.580
Well, you're eating out here.

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.090
I'm a warrior.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.670
Unlike you,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.970
I can eat wherever I like.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.470
Really?

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.100
But I feel like you're the same as me.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.350
I have no idea how a slave feels.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.060
If I were you, I'd kill Gorm and run away. 
I'd kill everyone who came after me too.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.320
Kill him? I could never kill someone.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.820
Then you'll be a slave for the rest of your life.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.120
It's your choice.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.250
If I run away...

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.750
Run away as far as I can...

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.710
If I run away to the other side of the ocean,

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.260
then what's there?

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.390
There's probably nothing there, right?

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.770
No matter how far I go, it'd be the same as here.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.650
Just filled with wars, and slave traders.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.210
Far west,

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.580
across the sea,

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.210
there is a land called

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.210
Vinland.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.170
It's warm.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.720
And fertile.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.470
A faraway land,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.890
where neither slave traders 
nor the flames of war reach.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.100
No one would be able

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.560
to find you there.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.480
Does such a place truly exist?

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.730
AUGUST 1013 AD 
VICINITY OF JELLING, DENMARK

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.910
The finest warriors 
from clans all over Denmark are gathering.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.450
In addition,

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:10.660
four of our Jomsvikings brigades are hastening 
to join them.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.130
Everything is proceeding as planned

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.130
for the upcoming campaign.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.550
The time has finally come.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.390
We must show those insolent English scoundrels

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.350
the power of the king.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.230
Sir.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.650
Yes, sir.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.270
We will fight without yield 
to achieve Your Highness's goal of capturing England.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.030
Where's Canute?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.780
He's here, right?

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.160
Yes.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.870
His Highness has already arrived in Jelling.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.290
He's resting to prepare to march.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.170
Your Highness. Are you sure, 
you don't want to change your mind?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.840
Ragnar.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.050
There's no need for His Highness Canute 
to come along.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.840
He's a candidate to succeed the throne.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.470
I must give him a chance 
to display valor on the battlefield,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.600
so that he doesn't lose to his brother Harald.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.310
But His Highness doesn't 
have much experience on the battlefield.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.560
Ragnar.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.070
I'm worried for Canute's safety as well.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.570
However, we're the leaders of the Vikings.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.570
If we don't demonstrate valor, 
the people will not follow us.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.160
We shall sail tomorrow morning.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:56.850
In August of 1013 AD,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.520
a Danish and Viking fleet, led by King Sweyn,

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:05.360
invaded the northern part of England, 
starting from the Humber River.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.360
In the region of Gainsborough,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.330
five major cities were taken,

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:16.910
and the main army continued 
their advance south over land with great speed.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.790
They overran the region, 
as they continued their advance.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.890
However, their steady advance came 
to a temporary halt...

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.600
LONDON

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.560
at the merchant town of London.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.150
OCTOBER 1013 AD 
LONDON, ENGLAND

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.920
What's wrong? Bring it on.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.130
This is a fun war.
