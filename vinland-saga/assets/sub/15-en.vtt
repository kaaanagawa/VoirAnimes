WEBVTT

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.520
I see. So, Canute is dead?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.070
No. He went missing, to be precise.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410
Ragnar's unit tried to rescue Canute,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.290
and engaged Thorkell in battle at Marlborough.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.950
In the midst of the confusion,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.670
His Highness the Prince went missing.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.550
Then aren't they still surrounded by Thorkell's men?

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.760
Yes. However, we didn't see anyone among 
Thorkell's men

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.470
who looked like he could be the prince for two days.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.980
He may still be alive and is waiting for help.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.570
However, even if we were to send help,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.570
we'd have to wait until spring.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.110
I'm sure you must be very worried,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.490
Your Highness.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.830
If Canute

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.460
had been as talented

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.750
as his brother Harald,

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.220
he might not have 
ended up missing.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.150
Wow! It's snowing!

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.230
AFTER YULE

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.490
The war is ending!

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.700
Winter.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.570
DECEMBER 1013 
GLOUCESTER, EARLDOM OF MERCIA

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.120
You're cold enough to freeze even a warrior's heart.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.870
Oh, winter!

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.500
Captain. Roasted pork or boiled pork. 
What do you want?

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.580
Give me both!

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.550
I can't understand you. Swallow your food first.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640
Okay.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.470
In any case,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.890
the fact that the prince escaped was a big loss to us.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.730
He didn't escape! You handed him over.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.900
That prince was a coward, 
but he could have been useful.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.450
We could have put him on a pedestal 
and started a new dynasty.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.370
It would have helped gather soldiers for an army 
at least.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.160
If you're the one who's going to carry him,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.410
you'd be pretty powerful.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.580
Indeed. What?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.250
Hey, you! English girl!

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.630
Yes?

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.090
Beer! Bring a keg!

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.180
Excuse me! They ordered another keg!

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.720
Another one? Damn!

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.930
Those rascals! They're going to eat through 
the entire city!

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.980
This is robbery!

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.650
Stop crying!

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.400
If I was going to lose the prince anyway, 
I should have given him to the English instead.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.870
What?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.490
You're so difficult.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.460
As soon as the fire starts to die down, 
you go looking for another spark.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.040
Of course, you bastard!

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.840
We're warriors!

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.590
A warrior is a warrior when he's on the battlefield!

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760
But you know...

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.720
I heard some bad news about that.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.020
They're going to recognize King Sweyn 
as the Bretwalda

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.850
at the next Witenagemot in Wessex.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.230
What?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.650
That's total surrender!

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.360
That's right. Denmark is going 
to swallow England whole.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.200
The nobility want to end the war, even if it means 
surrendering the throne.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.950
Every time I get a bad feeling about something, 
why does it always come true?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.170
What are you going to do? Attack King Sweyn, 
even if it means certain death?

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.500
You idiot!

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.550
I love fighting, but I hate losing!

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.420
When I fight, I fight to win!

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.220
This is no fun.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.690
I wish the world would be at war forever.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.520
It's a messenger! Is the lord here?

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.570
Anything out of the ordinary, Ear?

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.780
There sure is. It's damn cold.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.290
The snow absorbs sounds.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.330
NORTH PART OF EARLDOM OF MERCIA 
ASKELADD'S ARMY CONTROLLED FARM VILLAGE

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.920
Even I can't hear that far anymore.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.920
It's better than keeping guards all over the place.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.170
We can avoid giving away our position.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.970
Then do something about those guys.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.850
They're obviously not farmers.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.560
-Monks? Keep an eye on them, too. 
-Father, forgive us.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.190
"Forgive us." Hear that?

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.650
Must they constantly beg for forgiveness?

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.980
What a pain.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.070
Oh, God Most High,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.830
Our Father in Heaven,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.870
please gather the souls of the villagers

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.920
who lie in rest here to your side.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.420
Please save the souls of the men who killed 
these people.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.460
Please forgive us for our sins.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.300
This isn't the time to be praying for someone else, 
you bastards.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.770
Father.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.320
Can you hear my voice?

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.610
Our Father.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.820
You

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.240
created us in your image.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.330
But you didn't give us your power.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.290
Father.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.340
If you love both good men and bad men equally,

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.260
why do you test us, despite our powerlessness?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600
Father.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.680
Can you

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.190
hear my voice?

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.770
Our Father.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.020
I doubt

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.280
-your love. 
-Enough!

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.330
Did you say...

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.830
you doubt the Father?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.180
And you call yourself a Christian? 
You should fear the Lord!

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.180
We must not doubt the Father's love!

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.140
Every father...

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.560
Every father loves his own child.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.820
Your Highness...

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.490
Oh! Wait!

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.290
Father...

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.800
An army of Danes?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.300
Really?

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.930
Yes. That's what the message said.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.430
They've occupied a village 
at the head of the Severn River.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.890
We've received a request for reinforcements 
from the local lord.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.020
According to one of the villagers who survived,

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.900
the enemy has around 100 to 200 men.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.570
Soldiers from neighboring areas are already 
heading there,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.410
but we wanted to ask you to come too, Thorkell, 
because of your military fame.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.910
-What do you think? 
-Nothing, really.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
There aren't a lot of Danish units who would 
act alone there

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.380
at this time of year.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.840
They feigned to go by sea, 
but they're heading to Gainsborough by land.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.590
They must have been snowed in and are stuck.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.550
I'm almost certain it's...

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.480
Thorfinn and Canute.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.360
All right! Wake everyone up! Get ready to march!

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.610
And...

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.610
Hey, you.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.450
Pack us some lunch.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.620
For 500 men. Five days will be enough.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.120
Five hundred?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.460
Here we go.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.750
This is fun. If we do this right,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.960
we can enjoy this war for a long time!

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.310
How many men are there? Ear?

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.310
Who knows? Maybe 50, or 100.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.280
They're extending their line to the east along the forest.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.110
They discovered us quickly.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.610
Did we make a mistake somewhere?

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.780
I don't know...

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.620
They found us. We can't change that.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.620
We're leaving?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.960
Tonight? That's impossible!

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.460
I've only finished two sleds!

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.540
I just started on the third one yesterday!

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.710
Really? Thanks. Then finish them by tonight.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.880
We'll abandon the ones we can't finish.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.970
I said that's impossible!

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.100
We only have two carpenters!

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.970
The English army found us.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.140
-They found us? 
-Yeah.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.900
They came through the snow.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.150
They must really hate the Danes.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.270
Impossible...

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.860
We must hurry, or we'll miss our chance 
to escape.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.820
Understand? Hurry and finish.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.700
Okay.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.780
Bjorn! Prepare the men for battle.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.750
Capture their commander. 
I want to find out how they found us.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.540
Understood.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.630
Wait, Bjorn.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.750
One more thing.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.130
This is a good opportunity.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.550
Let's do what we discussed as well.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.760
They found us?

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.890
This is bad.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.890
We'll be fine! The English are weak.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.350
No. That's not what I mean.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.650
I was talking about Askeladd's luck.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.230
Luck?

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.650
First the heavy snowfall, and now this.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.780
This is the first time his plans have ever been ruined.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.960
Oh! What a tasty-looking rabbit!

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.290
-Are you the one who caught it, Thorfinn? 
-What?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.840
Are you going to eat it alone? Are you going to roast it?

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.260
Why do you care?

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.220
It's not good to eat nothing but meat!

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.970
Boil it with some vegetables!

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.600
I'll make some soup with that rabbit.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:55.980
Shut up. I can eat my own food however I want.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:59.360
You're going to borrow someone's stove anyway, right?

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.610
Come over here!

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.490
Your Highness! I've brought broad beans, 
cabbage, and rabbit!

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.580
Rabbit?

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.290
Yes. Thorfinn caught it.

00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.710
I thought it would be good to add to the soup.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.300
Thanks.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.130
Drain the blood and remove its organs.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.520
The ingredients are simple, but it tastes good.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.860
It's because of the rabbit.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.400
I've grown tired of eating salted-cured meat. Thank you.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.530
What's wrong? Don't hold back.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.030
It's your rabbit.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.920
It's good, right? Catch us a deer next time!

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.170
I thought royals only did the eating.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.340
It's my hobby. I don't usually cook.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.890
No one knows about it except Ragnar.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.520
You can't tell anyone either, okay?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.430
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.730
A long time ago,

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.650
I cooked some cod.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.480
It turned out well,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.740
so I brought it to my father.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.500
But His Highness didn't eat it.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.920
He was very angry.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.790
"You're the child of a king! Don't act like a slave!" 
That's what he said.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.220
I wasn't supposed to cook after that.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.050
A king's child doesn't need to know how to do 
things like this.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.230
At that time,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.560
His Highness must have been very busy.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.520
When this war is over, let's cook some poultry 
and bring it to him.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.740
I'm sure he'd be happy.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.780
What kind of poultry?

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.080
I've never cooked poultry before.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.540
Chicken, or duck.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.290
Do you remember the duck you ate during Yule?

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.460
Yes. That was delicious.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.460
I asked the cook for his secret.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.170
He made good use of the broth.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.430
The broth? I see.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.310
Ragnar!

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.560
You idiot! I have a message!

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.350
What is it? What's wrong?

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.650
The enemy has found us.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.270
A battle has begun in the woods to the east.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.530
What?

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:50.490
They don't have a lot of men,

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.410
but please be careful.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.700
What's going on?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.080
We've only been in this village for ten days!

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.170
-How come they found us? 
-How am I supposed to know?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.170
What's going on?

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.170
We even killed all the villagers...

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.430
In any case,

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.680
we're going to move once we defeat the English. 
Get ready.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.140
That's why I first said

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.600
we should turn back to Wales!

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.690
No. We're heading for Derby.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.070
He still wants to keep walking through

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.320
enemy lands in this situation?

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.650
Bring Askeladd here. Now!

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.660
He's leading at the frontline right now.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.950
If you want to talk to him, you should go 
see him yourself.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.200
I'll show you the way.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.840
Unbelievable! You men are just like your leader!

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.590
You don't have any manners!

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.760
He can't even read his own luck!

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.470
And he's a Norse warrior?

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.850
I swear on my sword, I'm going to show him

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.470
how foolish he is today!

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:03.560
Hey!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.100
Hey!

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.360
The sound of the battle is coming from that way!

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.950
You finally noticed? You're so slow.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.570
What? You bastards! What are you--?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.930
You bastards...

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.680
Sorry, Conehead.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.810
It's orders from Askeladd.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.200
Want to fight? We're okay with that.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.410
But you're going to die anyway.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.420
Bring Askeladd here! I have something important 
to tell him.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.840
Is it your dying wish? I'll listen. Tell me.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.130
Just bring him here!

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.760
It's related to His Highness the Prince.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.220
I need to talk to him directly.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.060
Hurry!

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.850
Let's hear your dying wish.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.240
Shall we speak in private?

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.200
The cries stopped.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.830
The battle is over.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840
Unbelievable.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.420
The soup got cold.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.260
I'm grateful to you.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:08.730
You did a good job keeping that coward of a prince alive.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.810
Your death will cause him to grow

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.230
even further.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.530
I will take over that job starting today,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.610
in place of you, who was

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.660
"killed by the English."

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.120
Swear to your god!

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.420
Swear that you'll take over for me,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.880
and that...

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.880
you'll protect His Highness Canute 
at whatever the cost!

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.010
I will protect His Highness Canute 
at whatever the cost,

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.640
and ensure that Ragnar the warrior 
did not die in vain.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.940
Are you satisfied?

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.190
It fills me with regret

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.650
to leave His Highness with you.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.650
You should hurry.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.030
You've lost a lot of blood.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.580
Before you reach

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.250
Gainsborough,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.460
you should prepare yourself...

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.970
The court in Jelling

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.060
are fighting over who will be the next king of Denmark

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.970
and has split into two factions.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.810
One of the factions picked His Highness Canute

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.810
as their leader.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.070
The other faction chose Canute's brother,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.690
Harald.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.910
They don't care about what

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:47.660
either of them wants.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.240
It's just a power struggle

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.580
amongst those traitors.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
His Highness the King feared

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.590
that the Kingdom of Denmark would be split.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.220
His heart was probably already decided.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.720
He decided to kill

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.100
one of the princes.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.650
King Sweyn decided to kill the prince?

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.650
The reason that the king

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.530
took the prince to the battlefield with him

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.450
was to have the prince die in battle.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.620
Be careful.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.620
Prince Canute's real enemy

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.620
is now

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.080
his father, King Sweyn

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.040
himself.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.050
Go into exile.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.130
That's the only way now.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.890
In Gainsborough,

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.350
my brother will make preparations

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.520
for you...

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.740
What's going on?

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.740
You should have told me earlier.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.080
Please.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.410
Just one...

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.210
last look...

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.670
Let me see His Highness.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.170
To say goodbye...

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.930
No.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.520
Your Highness...

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.350
Once this war is over...

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.280
let's cook poultry together.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:48.610
I'm sure

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.410
the king would be...

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.830
happy.
