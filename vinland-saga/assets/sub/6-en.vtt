WEBVTT

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.400
That feels so good.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.160
I'm going to wash off all my fleas and lice.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.910
Hey. Don't just sit there in the corner.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.080
Come over here.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
You'll be eaten by a sea serpent if you fall in.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.380
He's ignoring me?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.340
He's no fun.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.890
In the Middle Ages,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.890
Danes living in Denmark

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.900
who made a living as pirates, or thieves, 
were known as Vikings.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.610
The Vikings had always longed 
to live in England,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700
a vast and fertile land.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.950
At the start of the ninth century, 
the Vikings invaded England,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.920
and migrated into the northern region 
as they expanded their power.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.920
However, in 1002 AD...

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.840
Kill them all.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.930
the English army attacked the Vikings 
who had immigrated there.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.720
In retaliation,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.440
Denmark began to dispatch troops to England, 
and intensified its attacks.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.690
Following these political developments,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.110
the Vikings were thrust into a war

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.370
to subdue the English army.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.420
THE JOURNEY BEGINS

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.470
Don't stop.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.930
Keep moving.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.930
Shut up.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.810
I'm rowing, see?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.060
They went out with a big bang.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.740
All right. Let's stop here.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.400
Stop the ship.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.160
VICINITY OF GAINSBOROUGH 
THE CENTER OF ENGLAND

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.660
What a pain. It's so hard to walk.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.170
And it smells terrible.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.690
Damn.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.860
These guys aren't army regulars, are they?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.570
The Danish army hires guys like us 
for their own army.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.200
The Danish army?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.040
Are the Vikings helping in the war?

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.170
Yeah, skirmishes with the English army 
are breaking out all over the place.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.960
Vikings are incredible tools of war.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.840
The King of Denmark is going 
to invade England someday.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.390
I don't know when it's going to happen, 
but they're laying the groundwork now.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.850
You mean they're eliminating people 
who stand in the way

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.810
before the king sets foot on shore.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.230
That's right.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.810
If we assist,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.860
we'll be compensated well.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.370
There's so many bugs here.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.830
It's better than being cold.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.370
We got to earn a lot this time of year.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.300
Hey. Not bad, right?

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.510
You're right.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.730
The English troops harbored by the lord 
of this region are giving us a hard time.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.690
I have more than a hundred soldiers.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.230
My forces are greater than yours.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.690
The pirate's talking big.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.690
Don't say that.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.070
We're both Danes.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.240
Don't act as if we're the same.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.290
What did you say?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.250
Well, well.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.330
They're going to invade with full force 
in coming years.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.340
In that case, 
I think it'd be smart to move fast.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.010
None of you will die anyway.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.390
So, what do you want?

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.140
Seven pounds of gold.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.890
And all the treasure and food the lord has.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.810
And we're taking all the women.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.230
Five pounds.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.150
As for the rest, it's yours.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.030
It's decided. Deal.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.370
What? What are they talking about?

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.160
A job. They closed the deal.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.120
Great. Then it's time to eat.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.130
Well, then. 
I will send another messenger tomorrow.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.420
I'll leave the battle plans to you.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.880
Don't run away.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.260
You have nowhere to retreat.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.890
And don't try anything funny.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.650
They surrounded us.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.440
Hey. Ear.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.200
You're so loud.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.910
Shoot. Shoot.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.910
It hit my ass.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.090
This will be good exercise after dinner.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.000
Kill them.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.510
Beat them at their own game.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.890
Shoot. Shoot.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.100
Damn.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.780
Try achieving something great on the battlefield.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.660
Then I'll reward you with a duel.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.420
Something great...

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.170
Kid.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.920
Are you a pirate too?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.610
If you're angry, blame it on the blood of the Danes.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.080
Sorry. I didn't know you were alive.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.790
On the battlefield, the weak die first.

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.540
Like you.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.380
Damn.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.200
Damn kid.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.160
Die.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.210
You bastard.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.680
You're starting to look like a fighter.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.740
Hey, Thorfinn.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.950
Can you go scout for a bit?

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.240
What? Why do I have to go?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.090
Kid. How dare you?

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.850
Hold him down.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.310
I'm going to kill him.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.040
There he is.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:38.500
Over there.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.940
Over there. Don't let him get away.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.970
You know, I think the present king is a fool.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.100
Mom. Don't say that out loud.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.140
King Edgar from two generations ago was good.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.270
He made friends with the Danes.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.730
Everyone respected him.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.400
He was a good Christian.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.280
But the reigning king, King Ethelred, is no good.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.080
He suddenly killed all the Danes in the country.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.450
Of course they'd be mad.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.620
Mom.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.880
Don't say that in front of other people.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.500
If a soldier overheard you...

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.300
Mom. Come over here. Mom.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.930
1008 AD 
EAST ANGLIA THE EAST OF ENGLAND

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.800
You're awake.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.630
We were just about to eat dinner.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.340
How are your wounds?

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.510
I washed your clothes.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.060
Wear that instead.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.560
Your dagger is right there.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.900
These clothes might be too big.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.070
These are the only men's clothes I have.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.830
Okay, sit down. You're hungry, right?

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.130
You must have been starving.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.680
What's your name?

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.050
Where did you come from?

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.470
What happened to your family?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.850
See? He doesn't speak our language.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.770
Maybe he's a Dane.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.110
What are you trying to say?

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.520
No matter where he's from,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.240
Jesus would never forgive me 
for leaving an injured child lying there on the ground.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.450
But still,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.660
the Danes are the enemy of the English, right?

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.250
Dad's serving in the military, 
because the Danes attacked us.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.170
What's your point?

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:09.960
Women and children are not obligated 
to get involved in a quarrel among men.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.130
Maybe that's true, but still...

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.190
He's covered in fleas.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.530
Stop scratching. They're getting in the food.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.490
See?

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.580
Doesn't that feel better?

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.330
Boys are such slobs.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.920
My youngest son used to scratch his head a lot too.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.970
Whenever he did that, I'd comb his hair.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.600
He caught a cold and died two years ago.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.440
I can't understand what you're saying.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.070
I'm not English.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:17.950
What?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.370
So, you can speak after all.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.470
Hey, woman.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.130
Yes? What is it?

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.800
A Danish scout is hiding out in the area.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.220
Have you seen a suspicious-looking kid?

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.140
A kid? You mean, a child pirate?

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:48.650
Yes, but don't underestimate him.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.320
He killed two of His Highness' soldiers.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.860
He has an arrow wound on his left arm.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.880
Woman. Is that your kid?

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.130
Yes, he is.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.380
He's my youngest, John. Is something wrong?

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.970
He's the same height as that kid.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.600
If you see him, notify us.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.650
Do you understand what you're doing?

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.400
He's a pirate.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.070
He killed two people. Even though he's only a kid.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.080
Why are you hiding him?

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.620
It's not normal for a kid to be a pirate.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.170
Something must have happened.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:52.380
Something must have happened? So what?

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.000
That's not what I'm talking about.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:58.170
He can't replace John.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.810
I'm going to go see the soldier.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.400
R--

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320
Run.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.700
Wait.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.590
John.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.890
Do you see a sign from Thorfinn?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.060
It should be coming any time now.

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:51.980
I see it.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.810
Over there.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.820
There's a fire.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.740
The cottage on the beach is burning.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.120
Men. Come here.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.240
Hurry.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.910
Bring the buckets. The buckets.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.590
I knew it.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.060
So, you were disguising yourself.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.610
Hey. What's that?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.990
How terrible.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.130
Damn it.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.590
Who is that kid?

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.380
Did he kill him?

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:22.610
Why are you here?

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.150
I told you to run away.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.160
I told you in English.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.160
He's coming this way.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.280
There's still time. Run to the forest.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.040
Get far away from the ocean.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.620
Hurry, or else they'll...

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.420
Hey. What's that?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.440
No...

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.940
Run.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.730
Forget about the fire.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.150
Everyone, run.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.570
The Vikings are here.

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.750
Hey. Good job, Thorfinn.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.170
This village is doing better than I thought.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.170
Don't mess around.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.630
Finish them before the enemy arrives.
