00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.560
JANUARY 1014 AD - OUTSKIRTS 
OF GAINSBOROUGH, NORTHEAST ENGLAND

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.400
Thorkell's using it as an excuse.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.810
That's the only reason I can think of.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.360
But, Floki,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.320
-the reports from Derby-- 
-The left flank is undermanned!

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.280
Don't underestimate a force of 500 soldiers.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.990
We're talking about Thorkell's army!

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.490
Floki.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.120
If the reports are true,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.240
then your actions will be disrespectful.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.700
It's impossible.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.080
His Highness Canute can't be alive 
and with Thorkell as one of his followers.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.000
It's impossible!

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.560
Hey, Floki! Want to fight? I'll fight you.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.350
Restrain yourself, Thorkell.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.650
I thought I sent a messenger several days ago

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.690
to notify you of my return, Floki.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.690
Do you always greet your guests 
with spears in hand?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.320
No, of course not...

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
Askeladd! Why are you here?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.500
Are you deaf?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.210
I'm asking you whether you're going

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.300
to draw your bows against a member 
of the royal family of Denmark.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.010
No...

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.010
We Jomsvikings received an inaccurate report

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.720
that an enemy army was going to attack...

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.390
I apologize.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.190
Notify the king

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.780
that I shall be at his hall by evening.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.240
Make sure you report accurately.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.170
What in the world happened?

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.800
He's a completely different person.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.930
GAINSBOROUGH CASTLE TOWN 
DANISH ARMY HEADQUARTERS

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.140
Everyone, listen to me while we walk.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.980
We must not strike yet.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.060
CROWN

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.480
I don't have many allies within this army.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.110
If we strike now, they'll label us as traitors.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.820
We need time to prepare.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.080
Thorkell. You betrayed them once,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.540
but you're still popular among the warriors.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.830
Spend time with the leaders 
of all the clans

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.870
and mend ties with them.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.040
In other words, are you telling me

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.590
to go drink as much as I want, 
and that you'll pay for it?

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.130
As long as you invite the other leaders. 
Now, go.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.010
What a wonderful order!

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.510
I'm so glad I decided to follow you.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.270
-Let's go! 
-Hey!

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.440
Askeladd. Come with me to see the king.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.520
I want to hear what you think of him.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.480
Understood.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.230
And about the future.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.860
How will we achieve it?

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.400
Understood.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.120
I think an assassination would be best 
in the short run.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.290
Your brother, His Highness Harald,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.540
is far away in Denmark right now. 
This is a good opportunity.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.420
If the king passes away right now,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.840
then command of the army in England

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.710
is going to pass to you.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.970
However, if we do so, we must hide 
the person responsible for it.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.350
Thorfinn.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.980
In the future, I'll assign you with other tasks 
in addition to being a guard.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.100
I'm counting on you.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.940
Don't give me orders.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.610
I never said I decided to work for you.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.360
Please forgive him for his impertinence.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.570
I'll make sure I instruct this idiot properly.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.250
God...

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.380
must be watching us, even as we stand here now.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.380
People losing friends,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.220
and parents and children killing each other...

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.800
He must be looking down on everything

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.180
from up high in heaven.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.060
I'll never forgive him.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.400
I'm going to create paradise on earth.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.900
A peaceful and prosperous place.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.070
A utopia for those who go through 
suffering in their lives.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.700
I may not be able to achieve it in one generation,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.660
but I'm still going to take

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.290
the first step.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.040
I'm sure that God will cherish me

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.670
and summon me to his side.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.420
But...

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.840
in that moment I will tell him:

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.470
"We don't need heaven, nor its trials, any longer.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.020
Our paradise is on earth."

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.520
We're going to take back what we lost.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.570
I'm willing to turn into a demon 
if that's what it takes to do it.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.950
I will help you,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.370
Your Highness.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.590
Welcome back.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.510
I'm glad, Canute.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.980
Thank you for your kind words.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.310
I lost the soldiers you had entrusted to me.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.110
Your words are more than I deserve.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.110
Come closer.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.950
Wait.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.990
What do you think, Thorfinn?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.780
Yeah, they're there.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.080
About 20 of them.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.750
There are some up high too. Archers.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.250
Your Highness. It's an ambush.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.290
It seems that the king

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.550
knows about our intentions.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.760
What's wrong? Without further delay, come closer.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.180
You two.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.390
You must not draw your swords, no matter what.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.190
He who draws his sword first loses.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.360
That's the type of fight this is.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.210
My eyes have gotten used to the darkness.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.880
If I get a little closer,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.750
I'll be able to see the king's face.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.010
If I can see his face...

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.340
Stop.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.640
Right there is fine. Kneel down.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.400
His eyes are tired.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.150
Is this who

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.150
the king of the Danes is?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.400
Askeladd.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.410
What happened to Ragnar? I don't see him.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.830
He died. In Mercia.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.170
I see. That's too bad.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.760
He was a loyal subject.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.980
In normal circumstances, we should be 
celebrating your return with food and drink.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.690
However,

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.770
I wanted to speak with you once informally.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.860
Canute. Only you. Rise.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.660
Walk ten steps forward.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.550
You face has changed

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.550
in just a short time.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.310
You look like me when I was young.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.390
Then

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.690
you must understand what's in my heart.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.570
You're a troublesome child.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.780
I never imagined you'd become

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.450
just like me, even in that regard.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.910
Children

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.120
grow up watching what their parents do.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.830
Do not blame yourself.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.830
Long ago, when I was young,

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.960
I drove my father, the former king, out of this country

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.300
and seized this crown.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.720
I did it because I believed it was the best 
thing to do for the kingdom.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.600
The former king was cruel, but he was also a coward.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.610
The world would sink into chaos if someone 
like him had the crown.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.740
How can he say that when he's surrounded 
by this many guards?

00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.820
Shut up. He'll hear you.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.490
So, you decided not to keep up the pretense, 
Your Highness?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.660
Don't forget you're surrounded by the enemy.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.210
I thought that I had done something great,

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.380
and that I could do great things.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.510
Until I put this on, that is.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.180
This crown

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.970
has its own will.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.270
Once you wear this crown, you can command

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.020
a thousand ships and 10,000 men.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.230
You can take all kinds of treasure from distant lands.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.820
A power like that of the gods 
is bestowed upon you.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.120
However...

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.040
However, Canute,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.000
the king isn't the one who uses that power.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.960
That power is used by the will of the crown.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.300
Do you mean

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.180
the crown ordered you...

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.970
to kill me?

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.600
There are only two things that the crown 
orders the king to do.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.650
It orders him to use his power,

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.070
and to increase his power.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.490
Resistance is futile.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.450
The crown does not want you.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.020
Canute.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:52.980
I'll give you part of Cornwall.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.100
Live your days in peace there

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.610
while reading the Bible.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.780
If you refuse, then you'll die here.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.200
Did the crown make you say that too,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.580
-Your Highness? 
-Your Highness!

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.420
I humbly ask you to let me speak.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
State your name.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.220
I'm Canute's follower,

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.010
Askeladd, son of Olaf.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.390
With all due respect, consider whether your actions 
are in line with the will of the crown.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.480
Continue.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.690
His Highness Canute

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.480
stole Thorkell and the military power he commands 
away from London.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.950
If you become the king of England,

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.530
then London will have no choice but to surrender.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.540
The wealth of London will become yours untouched, 
Your Highness.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.170
His Highness Canute

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.250
is the one who made the sacrifice

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.170
for this great achievement.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.220
Is it not unreasonable to punish the man who rendered 
such distinguished service?

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.800
Your handling of this matter

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.930
would deeply trouble

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:12.930
your generals when the time comes 
to divide the new territory.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.180
Please reconsider this matter.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.400
You're a man who's good with words.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.860
Askeladd. "The one covered in ashes"?

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.780
That's your nickname.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.740
Tell me the name that your father gave you.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.160
I'm only known as Askeladd.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.210
My father didn't give me a name.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.220
You must be the child of one of his mistresses. No...

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.050
You must be a child he forced one of his slaves to have.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.360
What's going on? 
I've never seen Askeladd get so mad.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.450
Canute.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.240
You have a good follower.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.870
It is just as he said.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.870
I have to reward you.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.500
I am leaving for York tomorrow.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.040
There, I shall throw a banquet.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.210
I shall give you your reward there.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.570
My blood froze just now, Your Highness.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.110
What are you so worried about?

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.580
As you already know, the king

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.080
doesn't have enough justification to kill me right now.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.420
He's the man who they call the wise king.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.340
As long as we don't do anything reckless,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.300
it's safer to lie within the king's bosom.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.430
Then that's all the more reason to refrain from 
provoking him like you did just now.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.310
It's nothing of consequence.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.520
King Sweyn is a slave to the crown.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.520
The power of the crown.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.230
I will show him how to use it.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.700
Askeladd...

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.370
I must be wary of him.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.790
Cheers!

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.540
All right! Don't be shy!

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.340
This is all on His Highness Canute!

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.300
Long live the prince!

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:03.180
-That's his 57th glass! 
-He's a monster!

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.940
Hey! You've been drinking a lot. Who are you?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.980
I don't remember inviting you here.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.320
I'm Willibald. Did you forget me?

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.240
What?

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.530
What?

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.450
-Your beard is gone! 
-You look so young. How old are you?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.580
I'm 23.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.000
-No way! 
-You're in your early 20s?

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.670
All right! It's my turn next!

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.170
The captain is up now!

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.960
You're behind by 58 glasses!

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.630
What a strange man.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.300
He does whatever he wants, 
but no one hates him.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.220
True.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.270
So? What do you think?

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.810
Do you think you can kill him? The king?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.900
It's going to be difficult.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.280
That's what I'd say.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.110
I got the impression he's a smart man.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.410
He's discerning, and he's a man of action 
who can make the first move.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:08.330
When he saw that we wouldn't buckle under his threats, 
he switched to a different strategy.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.920
I would say he's skilled in war.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.130
No wonder he's the king of the country.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.720
He's a tough opponent.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.310
Even if we're planning to kill him someday, 
I guess now's not the time.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:27.020
Let's submit to his wishes for the time being

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.190
while we wait for our chance.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.570
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.990
I'm so glad you returned safely!

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:41.570
Do you have any idea how much I, Gunnar, 
worried about you?

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.830
I apologize that I was unable to greet you at the castle.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:48.500
I just returned from a foreign country.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.250
I always believed you'd return, of course!

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.590
Oh, is this gentleman over here your new follower?

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:58.130
Can you introduce me?

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.720
This is Ragnar's brother, Gunnar. 
Please become acquainted with each other.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.970
I'm Askeladd, son of Olaf.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.390
Oh, you look like a dependable character.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.600
I'm Gunnar.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.060
By the way, Your Highness...

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.780
that plan from a long time ago... 
The prospects look brighter now.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.900
I'm talking about the Duchy of Normandy.

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:23.240
I wanted to talk to you about it later 
with my brother.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.330
Ragnar is dead.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.620
Sorry for making you go through all that trouble.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.080
And I'm not going to go into exile.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.210
-Your Highness? What did you say? 
-I'm sorry

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.170
to put you to the trouble of 
running around to the other countries.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.630
I just picked a fight with King Sweyn.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.220
-Please help me. 
-My brother...

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.140
Gunnar.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.850
Your job is to keep an eye on the king 
and report back to me.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.560
Choose soldiers who you trust.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.770
Your Highness! You must not talk about that 
in a place like this!

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.070
I don't care. This is actually a good place 
to talk in secret.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.780
Your Highness...

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.870
You've changed.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.040
Of course I've changed. 
I must change everything.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.970
Gunnar's no good.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.480
I don't think he's as loyal to the prince 
as he says.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.450
How wonderful that you're so devoted 
to staying prepared.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.040
Doesn't your right arm hurt?

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.700
-Askeladd. 
-What?

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.210
I see. You're going home?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.840
I know you said you don't care,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.340
but we did betray you.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.470
I don't know how I can face you anymore-- 
Ouch!

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.270
I got you!

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.600
And look what happened to my brother.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.310
I hope Bjorn's wounds heal.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:23.610
Atli! And you still call yourself a Viking?

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.660
I can't believe I had such an honest man working for me.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.250
Bjorn's not going to last long.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.370
The wound reached his intestines.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.670
Now,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.710
Thorfinn is the only one left from among my men.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.970
It's the perfect time for making a fresh start.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.430
A bracelet?

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.050
It's gold. Take it.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.140
What? I don't need it! There's no reason for me to take it.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.020
Just take it.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.730
There's no such thing as having too much money 
while traveling.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.030
Sorry. I appreciate it.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.950
What?

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.620
Hey! Are you going to give it to me or not?

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.950
I have one condition.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.080
Never pick up a sword ever again.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.460
Swords don't suit you, Atli.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.170
Raise some sheep, get a wife,

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.460
have a kid, and die in your bed.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.180
If I see you on the battlefield in the future, 
I'm going to kill you,

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.720
even if you're on my side.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.970
Okay. I understand.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.530
-What's that? 
-This?

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.610
It's something important.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.990
It's pretty.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.620
That's too expensive! Give me a discount.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.290
Show me some younger women!

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.210
-Bring the younger women! 
-Any takers?

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.460
