00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.480
OCTOBER 1013 AD 
LONDON, ENGLAND

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.570
THE BATTLE OF LONDON BRIDGE

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040
That's not really a bridge.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.960
It's more like a fortress.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.130
I'm impressed, London.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.880
The city has survived many attacks 
over the years.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.800
It has a lot of history.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.890
This isn't the time to be complacent, Askeladd.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.890
This city's going to be trouble.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.810
You said it'd be an easy win. 
That's why I'm here.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.980
Sorry, sorry.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.230
I never imagined 
that Thorkell would side with the enemy.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.690
You mean, Thorkell the Tall?

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.200
He's in bed with the enemy for the money.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.360
What a traitor.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.990
We're in this for the money too.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.210
We sided with the Army of Denmark, 
because we thought King Sweyn has a chance to win.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.800
The other clans are all the same.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.130
They're desperate 
to prove themselves on the battlefield

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.300
and increase their share of the spoils.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.310
Well, with so many men here, 
no one's getting very much.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.650
I don't fight for money.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.310
I like to kill.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.320
I can truly rely on a man like you, Bjorn.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.820
In any case, those bigwigs all want London.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.700
If we can capture the Thames River,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.700
we can set up a supply line 
to the inland areas in Wessex.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.210
The top leaders all have their eyes 
on this battleground.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.000
Yeah. This is the place to be if you want to stand out.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.590
What do you mean?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.010
Do you have a plan in mind?

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.470
Well,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.970
it's not really a plan.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.510
Thorfinn.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.480
We have some work for you.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.350
Go bring me Thorkell's head.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.360
Promise me you'll give me my reward.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.530
Okay. Okay.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.490
The same as always, right? 
You're so stubborn.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.330
Getting so worked up about a fight you can't win.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.080
Maybe you get it from your father.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.500
Don't forget, Askeladd.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.210
My only wish as a warrior

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.680
is to beat you in a duel.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.140
Our next duel will be your last.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.220
I'm going to carve out your heart,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.810
and offer it to my father's spirit.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.940
Then get to work.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.570
Only those who fight 
on the battlefield get what they desire.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.200
That's the way of the warrior.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.080
My head's not cheap, you know.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.830
I'll duel you as often as you like.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.210
Go bring me Thorkell's head.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.470
Hey.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.480
Askeladd.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.060
What?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.860
One ship is heading towards the bridge.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.110
It's the Jomsvikings! The Sea Deer!

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160
They're messengers from the regular army.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.490
Are they Floki's men?

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.990
I bet he's going to try to win Thorkell over to his side

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.370
by saying he'll pay double whatever England pays.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.330
Thorkell will follow the money.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.750
I bet he'll take their offer.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.380
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.180
They're here.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.380
It's just one ship.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.390
This way. Hurry.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.150
Die. Take that.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.860
Take that.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:00.770
Fire. Fire.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.820
Don't shoot. We're messengers.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.150
We want to talk to Thorkell.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.910
-You damn bastards. 
-Die.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.580
We didn't come here to fight.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.040
Where is Thorkell?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.210
Shut up. Die.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.040
Hey.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.750
Stop.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.800
Yes, sir.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.670
Everyone. Cease fire.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.310
Hey, Floki. It's been a while.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.060
You look like you've been doing well.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.440
Enough with the pleasantries.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.570
His Highness, King Sweyn, sends a message, 
which I am here to deliver.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.820
In the words of His Highness:

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.490
"The King of England has escaped 
to the land of the Franks.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.080
Resistance is futile.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.620
Surrender.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.910
If you surrender, then in the name of Thor,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.620
I shall spare the lives of you and your men,

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.090
as well as leave you your fortunes."

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.130
Go back to the army, Thorkell.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.680
Those are the wishes of His Highness.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.760
Is King Sweyn here?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.220
He's tough.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.180
For such an old man.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.770
Thorkell.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.310
Why are you drawing your bow against a friend?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.440
For so long, we've fought as warriors, side by side.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.990
You must not misread the flow of the world.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.870
Your brother Sigvaldi is also worried.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.710
Flow of the world?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.370
I see.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.550
I was fighting against the English myself until last year. 
That's why I know.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.130
They're really weak.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.340
-They're a bunch of sheltered city boys. 
-What?

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.890
-Is that Norse? 
-They lack spirit.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.890
Maybe.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.060
Prince Edmund was the only general

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.890
who could handle the army of Denmark.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.270
This country is finished.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.770
Oh, in that case...

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.530
In other words,

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.200
it'd be more fun

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.910
to fight against you.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.410
What?

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.490
That's enough talk.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.250
Let's get to the next part. The next part.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.540
Wait. Thorkell.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.090
I promise you double what England's giving you.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.430
Here I go, Floki.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.640
Veer left. Full speed.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.730
Time for the deadly...

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:45.650
Keel-Buster!!

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.400
Oh, I missed.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.530
Full speed.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.660
Withdraw.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.740
Men. Kill them.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.660
Yes, sir.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.000
Retreat. Retreat.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.170
Hey, Floki.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.630
Go ask King Sweyn

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.140
whether he's bored 
of always fighting battles he's going to win.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.360
There's no chance that we'll be able to convince him.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.820
I see.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.360
It was a waste of time.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.110
So, what shall we do?

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.790
Attack them now, without delay.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.020
Hey. Damn.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.570
All right.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.700
Damn. They're attacking the pier.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.250
You bastard.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.580
Hurry.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.500
Damn.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.750
-Damn. I missed. 
-Get more rocks.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.880
Out of my way.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.510
Wow.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.260
Here we go.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.430
How'd you like that? 
That was my special...

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.020
er... Log-Dropper!!

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.350
The name says it all.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.480
That was amazing.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.730
Next.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.860
Hurry up.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.820
Yes, sir.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.990
What's wrong with Sweyn's army?

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.280
Why don't you come up with something?

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.450
I know you can do better if you try.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.710
At this rate, you won't capture London Bridge. 
Not even in a hundred years...

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.470
This is it. This guy looks fun.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.890
Thorfinn. Can you hear me?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.020
The huge man in front with the log.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:34.360
That's Thorkell.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.570
This is no good. Stop the ship.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:39.490
He'll hit us if we get any closer.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.200
Steer left.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.610
Just a little further.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.200
All right. That's enough.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.700
Jump.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.580
Don't touch him.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.080
This jolly little fool...

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.880
is all mine.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.920
Yeah.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.340
Bastard.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.600
Come on.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.570
You're good...

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.940
For a kid.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.290
Don't touch him.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.580
I'll answer the challenge of this suicide attacker.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.420
It's one-on-one.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.550
All right. Bring it on, kid.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.060
One-on-one, and unarmed?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.020
Don't underestimate me.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.240
Oh, he was aiming for my wrist.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.370
Good job, kid.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.290
I can see why he's so confident.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.630
With a body and fists as big as his,

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.630
I'd be dead with one hit.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:20.960
I like you.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.510
I'm going to have some fun.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.880
What?

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.850
Take that.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.270
Oops.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.770
Damn.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.650
That was close.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.020
I can't reach him.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.990
All his weak points are up high.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.700
Below his armpit.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.780
His neck.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:48.910
All right.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:55.960
He's low.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.210
So...

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.460
I'll kick him.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.750
Run in there.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.940
That hurts.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.520
But I got you.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.530
You did it.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.860
Great, captain.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:30.780
Kill him.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.830
It's not over yet.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.160
Here we go.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.170
Oh, dear.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.710
This won't work.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.920
Thorfinn's getting beaten to a pulp.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.260
I guess it wasn't going to work.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.420
Yeah.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.680
Askeladd.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.090
That's the signal.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.350
Yeah. Then it's time to retreat.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.430
Retreat.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.310
Withdraw all units.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.900
What? No.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.480
The battle ended while I was playing with the kid.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.650
Hey, kid.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.570
It looks like they abandoned you.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.070
Poor kid.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.580
Even though you tried hard.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.580
What? Is he dead?

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.750
Hey.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.210
Hey. Hey. Hey.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.980
You still haven't lost the will to fight?

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.690
You're good, even though you're small.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.160
Warrior.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.030
Tell me your name.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.330
Thorfinn.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.500
Son of Thors.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:06.710
I'm Thorfinn.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.170
Thors?

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.470
Hey. Thors? Do you mean...?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.100
Oh, there he goes.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.310
Captain, your orders?

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.520
Shall we shoot him?

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.520
Don't shoot.

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.110
We'll let him go today.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.110
Hey.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.900
Warrior Thorfinn.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.030
That was fun.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.830
Let's do this again.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.540
Let's finish things off next time.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.080
Promise me.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.720
That hurts.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.760
Kill me, please.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.180
Does anyone want to be killed?

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.220
I can kill you.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.480
He's not going to make it.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.980
He's been stabbed in the gut.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.280
We can't save him.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.400
Hey. Bring some onion soup over here.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.570
Torgrim.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.740
Take care of this.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.830
I see.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.750
So, we can't capture London.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.420
No.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.750
It's not that we can't capture London.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.380
It will just take some time.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.010
Time? How much time, Floki?

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.510
Yes. It depends on the size of their stockpile.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.850
One year.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.020
No. A half-year, if things go well.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.100
It's already autumn.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.520
We cannot spend so much time on just one city.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.490
The overall situation is most important.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.110
In everything we do,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.410
we must prioritize gaining control over all of England.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.330
Yes, sir.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:05.870
We shall move our main forces to the west.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.620
Leave 4000 soldiers

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.880
to continue the siege on London.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.670
As you wish.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.430
The 4000 soldiers will be under the command of...

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.480
Canute.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.100
This is a good chance to boost his standing.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.190
What?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.480
That's not what we agreed upon.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.240
The reason His Highness came 
to serve as a good example for the people.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.610
That's what you said.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.370
Ragnar. Please, refrain.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.120
This is His Highness's will.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.870
Against Thorkell, 
even the entire army stands no chance.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.330
To defeat him with only one-fifth of the forces...

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.250
It's impossible.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.000
Having so few men is the only way to help him.

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.130
But...

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.050
His Highness is unfamiliar with battle, 
and is experiencing emotional distress.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:03.810
This is your responsibility, Ragnar.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.980
Maybe it's because of the teachings of Christ.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:12.610
He grew up to be faint of heart, 
even though he's a man.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.320
It's because you spoiled him.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.490
I apologize.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.280
To Canute, 
I shall leave the soldiers laying siege to London.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.200
You shall accompany him, 
and provide support, as his assistant.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.590
Your Highness...

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.430
My shoulder is dislocated.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.140
And my right ankle is sprained.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.430
And I have a few broken ribs.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.560
Damn it.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.360
That madman.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.360
Hey. Can you see them?

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.490
Most of them have retreated.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:46.410
What?

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.870
Does that mean...?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:49.990
Did we...

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.160
win?

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.580
We won?

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.710
-They ran away with their tails between their legs? 
-Then we have won.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.510
What?

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.510
What's going on?

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:04.630
We did it. We won.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.550
What?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.350
We won.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.060
Hey, hey.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.520
Hey.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.810
Let's fight some more.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.060
Hey. Hold on.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.190
Hey.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.570
You idiots.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.110
Are you giving up on London?

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.070
Come back, you cowards.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.990
Fight me.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.130
Oh, what a pain.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.090
Thorkell, you bastard.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.470
Hey. What happened? You're alive?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.470
You look terrible.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.980
You had a bad opponent, Thorfinn.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.360
By the way, I'm going to march on Wessex. 
What about you?

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.360
If it hurts to walk, I'll just leave you here.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.550
We're going to get rich in Wessex.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.640
I can't wait.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:34.930
-You only got one arm. 
-I can handle anyone.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.600
I'll kill them all.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.080
That was fun.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.160
Let's do this again.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.790
That madman.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.840
What's so enjoyable about battle?
