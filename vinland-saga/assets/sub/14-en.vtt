WEBVTT

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.030
WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO FORGET US? 
WHY HAVE YOU ABANDONED US FOR SO LONG?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.240
God,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.540
do we really

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.750
have to be pure?

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.300
Really?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.050
My father said that those who do not 
follow your commands

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.100
shall be punished.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.680
Even if they're an angel.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060
A person like me

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.440
could never understand your will.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.570
But I feel that your kingdom in heaven

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.990
is very far away.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.370
Anne!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.500
Help me get dinner ready!

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.920
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.100
I felt burdened

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.640
to know that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.270
you sit in heaven

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.030
and watch us.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.450
THE LIGHT OF DAWN

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.620
Jehovah.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.670
Restore us to yourself,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750
oh, Lord,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.670
that we may return,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.260
renew our days

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.470
as of old.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.570
Oh, it's like this, Mr. Priest.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.480
That's it!

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.490
It's like me and my brother.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.410
We've always been together since we were kids.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.620
We helped each other out.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.000
Our teamwork makes us unbeatable

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.750
on the battlefield. Right?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.500
Yeah. We can read each other's minds.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.880
He's the only one I can trust to have my back.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.640
I'd never trade our relationship for silver. 
Right, brother?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.850
Of course not, brother. Well, it depends on how much.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.020
It's a bond of brotherhood!

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.940
-What do you think? 
-What do you think?

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.820
-Did we get it right? 
-Did we get it right?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.280
Well, who knows?

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.910
It's completely different from what I imagine love to be.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.040
Listen, you priest.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.420
You've never been on the battlefield.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.750
So, you don't understand 
how amazing this is!

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.420
A union formed in a moment of life or death!

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.720
You'd never be able to do it yourself!

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.220
I think it's wonderful.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.510
It must be something very valuable

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.930
to you two brothers.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.180
Well then.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.150
If I were to enter the battlefield,

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.730
would you have my back?

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.030
What? What are you talking about?

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.820
I can do it because he's my brother.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.620
I can't trust my back to a drunk priest!

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.660
Right?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.250
That's why it's not the same.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.170
Excuse me, could you explain it 
in a way I can understand?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.250
Well then, what about you?

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.590
You really like booze.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.090
Maybe that's "love."

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.220
No.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.470
It's not that I love booze.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.640
What?

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.930
Then stop drinking.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.390
I'm sorry.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.900
He doesn't make sense.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.980
You like things that don't make sense?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.230
Then how about this?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.070
The veterans still talk about it even today.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.990
It's a story about when 
we attacked a ship in the Faroes.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.700
There was one warrior on that ship.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.210
He had incredible strength.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.170
We attacked him together,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.970
but he beat 30 of our men with his bare hands!

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.130
His bare hands!

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.850
In the end, we killed him.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.190
But when it was time to count our losses, 
we found that no one had died.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.020
I wonder what that was all about.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.070
That guy was carrying a sword, right?

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.070
Maybe he thought we were no match for him.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.200
If so, it angers me.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.870
Where are his manners as a warrior?

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.080
Did he

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.870
do anything else?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.330
What's his name?

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.170
I-- I don't know his name.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960
I guess

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.300
weirdos are drawn to each other.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.350
That guy said some strange things, too.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.930
"A true warrior doesn't need a sword."

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.350
Something like that.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.490
What? Priest?

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.320
Hey. Where are you going? Hey!

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040
What is it, priest?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.630
Did we get it right? Was that "love?"

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.180
A warrior... A true...

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.930
Doesn't need a sword...

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.740
A true warrior...

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.420
Don't complain to me about the weather!

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.630
I'm a sailor. The weather on top of a hill

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.590
is not my area of expertise.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.680
No one could have predicted that it was 
going to snow this much

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.060
at the start of winter.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.850
That's not what I'm trying to say.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.600
I'm trying to say that luck is no longer on your side.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.480
We changed our route to beat the winter snows, 
and now we end up like this!

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.820
Your soldiers are also worried.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.990
My men have been to hell and back.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.290
For them, this is nothing.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.710
They're following their orders with no hesitation. See?

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.550
Turn back. It'd be crazy to try to cross Mercia!

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.590
If we're going to walk through the snow, 
we'll have to leave our plunder behind.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.640
My men aren't going to like that.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.100
Either way,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.480
we can't camp out in the open tonight.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.600
Askeladd.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.690
We're ready.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.110
We can go.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.230
All right.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.240
Askeladd.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.370
When luck's not on your side,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.740
no matter what you do, 
it's going to backfire.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.160
Ragnar.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.580
What are you hesitating for?

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.210
Attacking and plundering villages

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.630
is a tradition for us Norsemen.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.310
Our father, who art in heaven,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.570
give us this day our daily bread.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.400
And forgive us our debts,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.700
as we also have forgiven our debtors.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.360
And lead us not into temptation,

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.030
but deliver us from evil.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.290
For thine is the kingdom,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.750
and the power, and the glory, 
for ever and ever.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.670
Amen.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.000
Amen.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.760
Hey, Father!

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.010
Why do we always pray?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.020
Because Jesus told us to do so.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.350
Jesus is always right.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.520
What happens if we don't pray?

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:56.110
Well, the unbelievers are going to go to hell.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.530
That's right.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:01.870
Hell is a scary place where the devil lives.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.030
You don't want to see the devil, right?

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.290
I'm scared of the devil.

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.290
Yeah. I'm scared of him, too.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.790
But good kids who pray can go to heaven.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.300
Don't forget.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.880
It doesn't make sense.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.510
Everyone's going to be taken to heaven 
or hell soon?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.230
I don't want our family to get separated.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.100
But, Father,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.360
why did God decide to pass judgment 
on the world all of a sudden?

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.230
It's not sudden.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.610
It was decided a long time ago

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.570
that it would happen a thousand years 
after the resurrection of Jesus.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.830
In other words, 20 years later.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:57.300
When God passes judgment, 
all evil men are going to hell.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.130
I know!

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.090
The Danes are the evil men!

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:03.590
Yeah! They're really evil.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.430
I'm sure God knew that 
people like them

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.350
would turn up.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:14.230
Listen. Make sure you follow God's commandments.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.190
Anne.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.780
I have to pee.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.580
What am I going to do? I'm so scared of the devil!

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.310
But it's so pretty!

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.360
I put it on again.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.700
I wonder how much this ring costs.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.860
I wonder if God would forgive me

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.490
if I paid for it.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.500
The devil must have tempted me.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.090
I shouldn't have gone to the market 
when I don't have any money.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.430
I bet bad children like me

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.770
will be sent to hell 
on the day of judgment.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.940
I bet I'm going to be the only one 
in my family

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.070
who's not going to heaven.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.460
Wow!

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.460
It looks so pretty on my left hand, too!

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:11.470
Who are they?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.940
What's wrong with your face?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.980
Me, too! Me, too!

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.740
Weren't you listening just now?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.700
If you're not good, 
God is going to punish you--

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.120
Hey.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.960
I found dinner.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.920
BUT THOU HAST UTTERLY REJECTED US; 
THOU ART VERY WROTH AGAINST US.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.930
Everyone!

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.850
Run away!

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.100
The village is under attack!

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.180
The Danes

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.890
are attacking the village!

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.190
Shut up!

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.450
It's so warm here. I feel alive again.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.320
What's with this family? 
There's so many kids.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.290
What do you want all of a sudden?

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.750
Milk porridge with barley and a bit of jerky.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.920
It has onions in it.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.380
Hey. Get everything that can be used 
as a weapon.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.460
Okay.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.640
This is terrible. You're eating some bad food.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.900
Hey! What's wrong with you?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.570
Don't waste food!

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.860
-Mom! 
-You're going to be punished for this!

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.120
Are you okay? Hey!

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.830
How do you say it in English again?

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.040
"Give me all your food."

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.330
Yes. That's right.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.210
-Hey! 
-Hey, old man.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.430
Give me all your food. I'll kill you.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.560
And this one.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.610
Is that all?

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.320
Put it there.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.530
If we count two kids as one adult, 
that makes 50 people.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.780
That means there's only enough food for 50 
to last the winter.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.210
It won't be enough for 104 soldiers.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.840
What am I going to do?

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.840
They captured everyone! What am I going to do?

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.350
Hey, Priest!

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.100
You're the prince's teacher.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.600
That makes you our guest.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.520
I'll forgive you just once.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.860
But if you get in our way again,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.650
I'm going to kill you on the spot.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.280
I hate priests, to be honest.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.120
Are you guys

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.500
Danes?

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.330
Do any of you speak our language?

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.340
I beg you! Leave us half of the food!

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.180
Please, at least leave us half of the food.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.180
If we have half, we can make it through the winter!

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.730
I have a baby! Please!

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.570
A baby? That's rough.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:03.200
Don't worry. I made sure to think about you.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.210
You don't have to worry about making it through 
the winter.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.710
Really? Really?

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.670
It's true.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.420
You don't need to worry about making it through 
this winter or any winters to come.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.510
I'm going to release you from your suffering.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.520
Askeladd. They're civilians.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.730
Even if I let them live, I don't have any food 
to feed them.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.450
If even one of them escapes,

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.450
they're going to tell the enemy that we're here.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.370
We can't allow that to happen.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.000
How did it go? Were you able to dig the hole?

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.580
Yeah. We can fit 62 if we cram them in.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.710
Askeladd!

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.800
They're Christians!

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.090
So what?

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.180
This is what's best for the prince.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.640
All right.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.220
Any more questions?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.020
No more questions.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.430
Very well.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.770
Men!

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.770
Kill them.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.090
God.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.470
Are you watching?

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.770
Did my father,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.320
my mother, my grandfather,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.400
my brothers, and my sisters

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.990
arrive over there?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.050
You aren't going to call me there too, right?

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.720
Right?

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.390
Because

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.600
I feel elated now.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.820
I can't believe

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.660
such evil people exist.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:13.700
I can't believe

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.120
there are people who aren't afraid 
of your punishment.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.170
Just like the moment I stole this ring.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.970
I feel

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.680
elated now.
