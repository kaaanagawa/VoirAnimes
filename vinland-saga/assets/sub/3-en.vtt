00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.560
TROLL

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.900
There are no major changes.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.650
You will be compensated 
with five pounds of gold.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.320
I will only pay you in exchange for his dead body.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.990
You can do whatever you want with their ship 
and their cargo.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.200
Kill Thors.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.880
-Go ahead, boy. 
-My turn next.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540
Thors?

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.210
The Troll of Jom.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.960
I've heard of him before.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.680
Are you sure it's okay if I kill him? 
He's a hero to you guys.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.010
If he were a hero, I wouldn't have told you to kill him.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.810
He broke military law.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.440
He deserted during battle.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.150
Orders to have him executed were issued 
15 years ago.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.320
I know you have strict laws, 
but it's been 15 years.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.280
Thanks.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.790
No, don't get the wrong idea.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.210
As long as I receive fair payment,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.750
I'll do any job.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.000
But you know, master...

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.630
If you're going to execute one of your own, 
one of your own should kill him.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.050
You went to Iceland, right?

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.850
Why didn't you kill him there?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980
This Christian monk is dead.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.560
It's none of your business.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.190
You shouldn't ask questions. 
It's for your own good.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.110
Well, all right.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.780
Five extra pounds of gold, paid in advance.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.200
Then I'll accept your job.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.170
You think you have the upper hand on me. 
You must be confident in yourself.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.350
Oops, sorry.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.180
It slipped. Are you okay?

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.480
Hey. Be careful.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.980
You guys almost hit me.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.190
You klutz.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.980
You drank too much.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.110
Five extra pounds of gold, paid in advance.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.320
You accept?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.330
All right.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.590
Excellent, master. 
You're a great man. See you later.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.460
And by the way...

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.470
What kind of a warrior is Thors?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.510
What does he look like? How does he fight?

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.730
Thors is no longer a warrior.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.610
Okay. That's enough drinking.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.360
It's time to work, you bastards.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.160
Bjorn. Nice spear throw.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.240
No sweat.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.370
Even Floki was in shock.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.540
I wish I could have seen it myself.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.300
It seems he's not a man of empty words.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.980
The time has come for me, 
Ari, son of Geitr, to become a man.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.360
I know. Don't say a word. 
It will not be an easy journey.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.740
There's no guarantee that I won't be injured in battle.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.080
But I shall return.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.960
I'll return with a necklace 
I seized from England as a gift to you.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.710
-And then will you...? 
-Hey, I'm still sleepy.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.590
Ma-- Marry...

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.710
Ari.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.720
You forgot your lunch.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.630
Mom?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.970
Why are you so careless?

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.890
Make sure you share the salted herring 
with everyone else.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.850
-I stuffed it full. 
-Mom. Wait over there.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.310
How can you say that to your own mother?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.980
-When I return... 
-What's wrong...?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.110
I'll finish what I was saying. 
Wait for me, Ylva.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.990
They're departing today.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.950
I hope they don't die.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.500
Ylva.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.330
Do you have a moment?

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.790
Wait. I'm first.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.590
Hey. Ylva.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.500
Can you try somewhere else?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.350
Make sure you bathe on Saturday, my boy.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.640
I know, Mom.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.470
I swear on my father's ax.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.230
I shall bring back a barrel full of gold coins.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.650
They're so excited.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.440
But there's only five of them in total. 
That's not enough.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.110
Thors says that five is enough.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.990
Well, if that's what he says.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.830
But that's barely enough 
for sailing two ships.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.920
It's Thors we're talking about. 
I'm sure he has a reason.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.670
Hey. What were you talking about with Ylva just now?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.670
Shut up, you jackass. You stay away from her.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.760
Watch your back on the battlefield.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.550
Don't underestimate me. 
I was going to say the same thing to you.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.760
-Ari. 
-What?

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.270
Be careful.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.860
You didn't finish.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.230
What did you say?

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.150
This way.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.780
Miss.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.660
Are you worried about Ari?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.660
Want me to tell you a secret?

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.670
What? They're not going to battle?

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.540
It's a secret.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.090
We're going to stop by Norway 
on our way to Jomsborg.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.680
Thors plans to leave the young men behind there.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.720
Thors is going to get some help 
from some sailors in Norway

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.560
to make it to Jomsborg.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.690
I'm friends with the previous King of Norway.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.690
I have a lot of influence there.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.150
As soon as I'm done with my business,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.320
I'll bring the young men back here.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.330
Five men is the most I can bring back 
on my run-down ship.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.500
He won't bring anyone to the battlefield.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.710
That's the kind of person that Thors is.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.220
Thorfinn.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.890
Hey. Where are you?

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.060
Thorfinn.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.650
Excuse me, Leif...

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.400
Does that mean Thors is going 
to the battlefield alone?

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.620
Ready to row?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.450
Yeah.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.750
What's wrong with his oar?

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.050
I can't believe Thorfinn isn't seeing Father off.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:15.510
I bet he's still angry he got scolded yesterday.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.760
-Helga. 
-Yes?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.390
Tell Thorfinn...

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.600
Well...

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.270
What I mean is...

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.650
Yes. I'll tell him.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.150
I'm counting on you.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.660
All right. Depart.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:53.760
He's so strong.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.470
Idiot. Don't stop rowing.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.090
Row. Row.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.470
You can do it.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.980
Bring home some souvenirs.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.690
See you.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.650
Raise the sail.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.410
My hands are peeling.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.040
My butt. My butt.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.040
Hey. Hang in there.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.710
Ari. Take the rudder.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.300
Mord and Magni, adjust the mainsheet. 
Hakon and Grim, take the jib sheet.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.970
Are you tired?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.140
No. It's nothing.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.650
Don't worry. 
We don't have to row any more for a while.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.610
We're riding the current now. 
The ship will move on its own.

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.990
Does that mean we can't turn back anymore, Father?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.490
Yeah, that's right.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.950
"Father"?

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.250
Thor--?

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.830
Thorfinn? You...

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.250
You can tell me later.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.920
I made it...

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.810
You naughty--

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.900
Father.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.150
It's the ocean.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.670
This job is suspicious.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.920
Why?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.750
Floki is hiding too many secrets.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.800
He's lying about the execution order for Thors.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.680
I'm almost certain of it.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.590
Then why...?

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.680
It's an assassination.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.850
Maybe it's a personal grudge or something. 
But I'm sure he cooked this up all on his own.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.980
Who cares?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.440
It doesn't change the fact 
that you'll get paid for killing him.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.860
Why do you think he didn't use one of his own men?

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.200
Because that'd be going against orders. 
He'd get his hands dirty.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.780
Well, that could be true.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.080
What if he's afraid of a loss?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.670
A loss so large that he won't 
be able to explain it to his boss.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.340
An entire Jomsvikings unit?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.880
Just to get one washed-up soldier? That's crazy.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.890
Hey. Come down from there, kid.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.770
I want to get a look at this guy.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.440
"The Troll of Jom."

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.360
I hope he's a fun guy.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.760
I can't even see the stars. I can't see anything.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.090
Which way are we heading?

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.340
Thors.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.350
The wind changed a bit. Slightly to the right.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.640
I'll lead. Follow me.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.730
Got it.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.610
Amazing.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.110
How can Leif sail through the sea like this 
without getting lost?

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.080
Ari.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.130
Don't stare into the sea at night.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.380
It'll pull you in.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:09.640
Hey, Thors.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.140
What is it like on the battlefield?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.730
I heard you fought in a lot of battles.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.770
Tell us some stories.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.650
I want to cut off some general's head,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.150
so I can become a real man too.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.160
I see.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.160
My daughter likes strong men.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.910
You have a tough job ahead.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.870
Well, what can I say?

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.170
You can tell?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.170
Are you in love with Ylva, Ari?

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.170
Yeah, I like her. She's cute.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.970
She was born while I was still 
in the Jomsvikings army.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.560
She was my first child.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.530
You're so loud.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:09.900
Do all babies cry so much?

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.830
-Thors. Don't hold her like that. 
-Her neck. Support her neck.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.330
Give me a boy next, Helga.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.330
The leader wants a boy.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.750
My wife Helga is the daughter of the leader 
of the army.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.220
It was a difficult birth. She looked pale.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.890
Thors.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.600
Give her a name.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:37.600
Name her as you see fit.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.430
I'm busy.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.650
We're about to go on a campaign to Norway.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.110
Thors, the ship will soon depart.

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:45.860
Okay. I'm coming.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:46.940
Thors.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.570
Give this child a name.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.540
I've been with her for 15 years,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.450
but that's the only time

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.160
I've ever seen Helga mad.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.340
Ylva was my mother's name.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.840
It came to me all of a sudden.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.100
Now that I think about it, that's when it started.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.940
That's when I started to get scared of battle.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.610
That's why I ran away.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.990
I bet my old war buddies would curse me 
if they knew.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.990
Hey. I can see the Faroe Islands.

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.770
Father. Father.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.270
Are we in England? Did we arrive in England?

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.020
No. Wrong answer.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.270
These are the Faroe Islands.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.320
They're in the middle, between Iceland and Norway.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.280
Our journey will be easier if we rest here for a bit.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.280
There's a village beyond this cove.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.950
Let's get some water there. 
And we can trade too.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.880
Are you planning to come along, 
all the way to England?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.790
Yeah.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.710
Get ready to row.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.310
Come on, hang in there.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.640
I wish we didn't have to do this.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.810
My butt hurts.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.950
What's wrong, Leif?

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.200
Something's wrong.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.580
What's wrong?

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.200
I wonder what's wrong.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.960
Something feels different 
from the last time I was here.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.130
I see. It's the number of houses.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.470
The number of houses decreased.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.520
Let's turn back, Leif. I have a bad feeling about this.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.020
The terrain's bad too.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.140
What? Are you serious?

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.570
Hey. They're going backwards.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.530
Did they notice us?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.360
They're good.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:41.030
They're very careful. They might be strong.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.740
They're too close, but it can't be helped.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.540
I don't care if the ships get damaged. Do it.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.570
Our exit...

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.780
Take that.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.660
Great. They're caught like rats in a trap.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.170
Thors. Everyone. Are you okay?

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.080
Is everyone okay?

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.590
-Yes. 
-We're okay.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.460
They will fire arrows. 
Cover your head with your shield.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.300
Leif. How's the damage over there?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.970
We're okay. The ship is fine and everyone is okay.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.220
They're coming.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.440
Whoever's behind this trap 
is in the back of the cove.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.480
The back?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.330
Pirates?

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:22.880
These pillars are from a house.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.470
We're completely blocked.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.010
They got us.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.310
Maybe they'll spare our lives if we surrender.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.640
How do you know?

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.060
They won't spare our lives.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.270
If they catch us, they'll sell us at the slave market. 
Get ready.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.150
This is nothing.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.070
There's only two ships.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.410
Stop, Ari.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.530
They're experienced.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.410
They're not just some farmers working as pirates 
in the summer for some extra cash.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.170
You're no match for them.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.460
Father...

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.260
Thors...

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.240
Thorfinn.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.870
Use it only to protect yourself. Understand?

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.660
Only when you really need it.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.840
Are you going to kill them? 
You are going to kill them.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.010
All right. I'm going to kill them.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.100
Stop saying "kill" so lightly.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.230
Bjorn. That mushroom...

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.230
One, two, three...

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.240
11, 12... And one kid?

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.240
What? Is that all?

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.700
Hey. Askeladd.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.120
Is it okay if I take care of them?

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.170
It wouldn't be fun if all of us went after them at once.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.340
I'll go see 
how good the Troll of Jom really is.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.510
Okay. They look like they want a fight too.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.430
What?

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.390
-What? 
-You bastard.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.270
What's wrong with you?

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.730
Where did you come from?

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.190
Brother.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.700
He's good.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.200
Take this.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.470
You're good...

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.050
Troll of Jom.
