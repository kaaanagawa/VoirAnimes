WEBVTT

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.860
Well then, what can I do?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.450
How can I protect my country from these fools?

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.120
As a reward for saving the prince,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
the king presents you with 50 pounds of silver.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.920
Accept it with gratitude.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.380
I heard that you fought hard to save Canute.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.090
Accept my gratitude.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.760
Yes, Your Highness. Thank you for your reward.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.730
I have high expectations of you 
in our battle to subjugate Wales.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.610
It appears that sly old fox has noticed.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.740
Your Highness, with all due respect,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.290
are you sure that your plan to subjugate Wales

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.170
is the best decision?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.720
END OF THE PROLOGUE

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.020
I believe the campaign to subjugate Wales next spring 
will prove to be a fruitless battle for our army.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.440
Please, reconsider the matter.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.740
Askeladd, you said you weren't going 
to stir up trouble for now.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.860
So that's Askeladd?

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.660
I can't believe he objected 
to the king's plan in front of him.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.290
Sorry, Your Highness.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.960
When it comes to Wales, I'm not going to back down.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.920
Explain your reasoning.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.590
Thank you.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.720
First, we've been fighting the English for 10 years.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.900
We should be focusing on recovery 
for our people and our land right now.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.230
Another reason is that 
the terrain in Wales is perilous,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.780
and as a result, the land is infertile.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.700
Attacking Wales would be like whipping our horses

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.080
to make them jump off a cliff 
just to catch a single rabbit.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.920
To put it simply, conquering Wales 
isn't worth the cost.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:17.590
He's right.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.300
I'm glad he said it.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.470
He's good at talking.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.180
This isn't a conquest.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.390
The point is that we can't ignore those 
who show disrespect for the king.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.770
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.560
If that's what you're worried about,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.610
please, let me be your messenger.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.240
Allow me to show you that 
I can persuade the people of Wales.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.240
Are you telling me, the king, 
to show courtesy towards them?

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.120
To the country you just called "a rabbit"?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.290
If you show courtesy,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.590
then they will understand your generosity.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.050
Please, listen to my entreaty.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.060
Is he going to kill him?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.120
This is how a loyal vassal should act.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.200
The greatest treasure anyone could ever 
offer a king is words of advice.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.960
My army is filled with loyal 
and brave men like this man.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.500
I am unworthy of your praise.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.300
How boring.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.600
Please, continue to lend me your aid.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.400
Wales or Canute, choose one.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.530
Honestly, I don't care about Wales.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.030
Give me Canute's head and join me,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.200
then I'll let Wales go free.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.460
I've looked into who you are a bit.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.380
Your mother really was a slave.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.710
I can guess why you're so caught up with Wales.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.470
The only merchandise that Wales produces

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.390
is slaves.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.110
What do you think? It still sails.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.360
This is the ship you've always wanted to sail on.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.740
I can finally let you onboard.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.790
You can rest until Mord and the others return.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.250
-Hurry up. Bring it over here. 
-Okay.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.340
-Is there still a lot left? 
-Yes.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.310
What are you doing? Be careful!

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.670
You must be hungry, right?

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.210
Give me a minute. I have some good jerky.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.590
Thorfinn.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.760
Thorfinn? Where are you?

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.770
Thorfinn?

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.400
Thorfinn.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.500
I hate the way your face looks.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.720
I'm not going to let the crown rest 
on top of a head like yours.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.680
Did he just say...?

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.430
What did you just say?

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.610
Are you deaf too, you old man?

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.480
I said, how dare an ugly old man like you 
wear something shiny?

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.410
That's not what the face of a king looks like.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.700
Don't move, guards.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.920
The king is within reach of my sword.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.220
-Is he serious? 
-Oh, dear.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.100
Askeladd.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.560
You bastard! King Sweyn is mine.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.980
Don't move, Thorkell!

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.900
Askeladd's not acting normal. Don't provoke him.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:37.160
Put away your sword, 
then I'll forgive you for this offense.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.820
Forgive me?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.620
Don't push your luck, you savage.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.830
As punishment for mocking my family and my people,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.210
you deserve to die!

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.670
This is my last warning.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.670
Put away your sword, Askeladd.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.090
That's my nickname.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.010
I'll tell you the name my mother gave me. 
My real name.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.390
Lucius Artorius Castus.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.570
I am the legitimate king who deserves 
to rule over the land of Britannia.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.320
Now. Go!

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.180
I feel better now.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.150
All right.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.200
What are you standing there for? Engage!

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.000
Engage!

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.790
This man is the criminal who murdered the king!

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.340
Kill him!

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.510
Hey, what's going on?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.860
What?

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.360
What's he doing?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.030
What's going on?

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.120
What's he doing?

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.750
That idiot!

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:05.640
What's wrong?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.270
Who wants to die next? Step up!

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.890
The king of Britannia is going to kill you himself!

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.400
Don't be afraid! Surround him!

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:23.780
Die!

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.620
Hurry up!

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.910
-Don't push! 
-You too!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.250
Out of my way!

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.420
Damn. Out of my way!

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.420
Askeladd!

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.800
Hold it in, Thorkell.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.800
It's not your turn yet.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.350
I don't care anymore.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.140
He's gone mad.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:56.230
I hate it when someone steals my prey.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.230
He hasn't gone mad.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.690
He's putting on an act.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.070
He just chose to save both me and Wales.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.080
He's only feigning madness in order 
to take the blame for killing the king.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.620
Let him run wild for a bit.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.290
I'll let you put it to an end.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.250
I don't care.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:24.380
Thorkell.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.430
I know he's your vassal,

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.850
but a dog should be handled by his own master.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.110
What's wrong, Danes?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.110
Askeladd!

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.530
You bastard.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.660
Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.490
You killed the king.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.910
What are you talking about?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.120
I'm right here, alive and well.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.960
Shut up! You're the child of a slave!

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.630
You swine.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.640
Is that how you talk to a king?

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.180
Kneel down!

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.770
I'll let you have the honor of kissing my shoes

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.230
and then die!

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.070
Askeladd!

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.320
Stay back, Thorfinn!

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.640
Is this the first time 
you've stabbed someone, prince?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.740
You did well.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:20.670
Hey, Askeladd.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.960
Hey, that's...

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.960
-Did he kill him? 
-The prince! The prince did it!

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.640
Stand straight.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.390
This part is important.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.360
This moment on stage was created for you.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.860
Don't waste it.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.120
Hey, baldie, what are you doing sleeping there?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.870
Damn. Damn.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:00.460
How could you let them stab you there, you idiot?

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.040
Come on.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.750
Shut up.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.000
Let me rest.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.880
You bastard. Get up. We've got to run away.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.970
You fool.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.930
Just hurry up and do it.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.890
Sorry to make you wait.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.140
I'll give it to you.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.940
I'll give you my life.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.480
Kill me.

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.150
We are-- We're enemies after all, right?

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.950
Are you going to die?

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.700
You?

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.790
Hurry up.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.580
There's no time left.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.760
Are you trying to make a fool out of me? You bastard.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.220
It wasn't supposed to be like this!

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.560
The duel to settle things between me and you 
wasn't supposed to be like this!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.310
I won't forgive you.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.060
Don't die on me.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.570
Get up! Duel me right now!

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.820
I'm the one who's supposed to defeat you!

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.450
Hey, you!

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.820
-You're kidding me! Hurry up and stand! 
-Come on.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.080
This is why I hate kids.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.830
Duel me! Hey!

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.290
How

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.500
do you plan to live your life?

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.970
In the future,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.430
after I die,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.020
how do you plan to live your life, Thorfinn?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:51.110
You haven't thought about it, right?

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.940
Shut up.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.530
Move forward already.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.530
Don't stay

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.370
stuck in a damn boring place like this forever.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.000
Go far ahead.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.800
Go beyond the world where Thors went.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.760
You're Thors' son. Go.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.010
That's

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.470
your real fight.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.360
Become a true warrior,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.190
son of Thors.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.350
Thorfinn, I won't ask you to forgive me.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.980
He was dealt this punishment 
because he went mad suddenly

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.440
and committed the crime of murdering the king.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:19.740
However, I'm sure you don't feel like 
serving me now that this has happened.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.490
Go wherever you want.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:41.680
Kill him!

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.260
-He's a traitor! 
-Stop!

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.850
Don't kill him!

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.480
Stand back. I will decide what to do with him.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.150
Thorkell, that's enough.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.110
Being stabbed is a small price to pay.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.870
Your Highness, you should have 
your wounds treated in the inner chambers.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.910
Let me handle matters here.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.910
Take him.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:10.830
Floki.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.380
Now that the former king has passed,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:18.300
do you know who the commander 
of the army in England is now?

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:20.970
Well...

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.550
What's wrong?

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.800
Say it.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.270
Everyone, hear me.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.530
The former king,

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.200
His Highness King Sweyn, has passed.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.950
From this day forth, I, Canute,

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.490
shall act as the commander of the army 
and the ruler of England!

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.960
We will not pursue the subjugation of Wales.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.750
Now that the former king has passed,

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.340
I predict that the remnants 
of the English army will revolt.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.630
We must prepare to handle that first.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.970
I will provide further notice 
regarding your rewards later.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.100
That is all. You are dismissed now.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.440
Hey.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.550
Hey.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.800
Hey, you.
