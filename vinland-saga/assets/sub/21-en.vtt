WEBVTT

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.980
In 1014,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.610
York

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.070
was controlled by the Vikings of Denmark, 
led by King Sweyn.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.280
The land was used as a base

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.910
for exporting slaves all over Europe.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.250
The Vikings served as

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.040
slave traders.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.550
I know how you feel, boss.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.050
But we're not rich enough to free the slaves

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.970
Reunion

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.140
out of compassion.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.720
It's been 11 years already.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.190
Isn't it about time now?

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.520
That day, without Thors,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.150
we wouldn't have gotten out of there alive.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.320
I must repay him for his help.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.450
Hurry! All of these over here!

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.160
-Over there! 
-Hurry! Go!

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.210
What?

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.960
Hey! You!

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.670
You in the dirty cargo ship! 
Get that ship out of the way!

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.590
Hurry up! The first ship's almost here--

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.760
Heave ho!

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.930
Heave ho! Heave ho!

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.810
Hurry up! A nobleman's ships

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.690
are about to pull in along this pier!

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.980
I got it.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.990
So, this is York.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.700
It's a big town.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.740
Yes. It's an old town that prospered 
in the days of the Roman Empire.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.250
People and goods from both Northern Europe 
and England all gather here.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.170
His Highness the king must be planning to 
establish the capital of his new dynasty here.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.340
It's a good decision. I'd do the same thing.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.180
Come on! Who cares if they're nobility?

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.770
Those guys are a pain. Damn.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.270
Hey, boss. Take care of the one on the stern.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.610
That man...

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.320
That's right. It's definitely him.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.950
I'd never forget that face.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.420
Askeladd! The pirate who killed Thors!

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.920
-Hey! Don't push! 
-Who's ships are those?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.710
-Prince Canute's. 
-What will you do?

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.130
The king is going to strike at tomorrow's banquet.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.300
Well, about that...

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.180
It's obvious that we're going to lose out 
at the Imperial Council tomorrow.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.310
For example, he could give different territories

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.190
to you and Thorkell to isolate you.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.230
He'd be giving you a reward, 
but he'd also be giving you an order.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.240
If you refused, you'd be suspected 
of harboring rebellious intentions.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.450
It's all up to the king what he wants to do with you.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.620
If he takes Thorkell from us, we're in trouble.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.250
True. We'd be in trouble.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.090
So... What's the plan?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.970
How about this?

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.640
We could try exposing the secret 
to the people around here.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.890
Exposing the secret?

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.310
Which one is the prince?

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.060
Isn't that him?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.680
Your Highness Canute.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.940
I mean that you're going

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.280
to die here right now.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.460
He got shot!

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.920
His Highness the Prince got shot!

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.170
-Raise your shields! 
-Where'd it come from?

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.590
From the north bank! Find them!

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.220
He was shot from this side? Unbelievable.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.720
What an easy job.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.060
Hey!

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.480
What's happening?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.980
This is bad.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.360
We better not get involved in this.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.400
Hey! Where are you going, boss?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.110
It's him! He was there!

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.580
What's wrong?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.790
Are you okay?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.540
You're bleeding!

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.140
You wasted so much of my time.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.080
Hey! You bastards!

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.540
What's going on?

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.540
I bet you're the snipers!

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.630
He's the sniper. It wasn't me. Here's the weapon.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.340
What's that?

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.180
-Is it a bow? 
-That's the weapon?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.350
Is he your friend?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.430
No, I--

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.930
You can't fool us!

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.480
You're just trying to blame everything on him

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.400
and save yourself!

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.940
I said it wasn't me!

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.440
No! I can tell from your eyes!

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.150
Your eyes are so murky.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.110
It's so obvious that you're a villain--

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.200
Don't resist, you bastard!

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.210
He's using a knife.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.750
He's small and he's young.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.670
Are you...

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.550
Thorfinn Karlsefni?

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.630
Thorfinn?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.600
Karlsefni?

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.560
Who is he?

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.390
You idiot! Don't you know who he is?

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.310
He's the man who won a duel against 
Thorkell the Tall with only two knives!

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.980
What? No way!

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.110
In that case, this is bad.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.360
He's one of His Highness's vassals.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.280
Seriously?

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.240
Excuse me for a bit.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.860
You...

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.620
Are you...?

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.040
You're from Iceland, right?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.580
Your name

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.170
is Thorfinn, son of Thors!

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.210
You're...

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.760
Leif.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.930
You're alive! I'm so glad.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.850
I'm so glad!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.690
Out of the way!

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.190
Don't shake him, you idiot!

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.190
Where was he hit?

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.190
His chest. It's bad!

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.950
Your Highness! Hold on!

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.570
Your Highness! We're going to cut off your clothes.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.550
I had that feeling all along.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.970
His Highness is a woman!

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.810
-This is big news! 
-No way!

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.060
You idiots.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.560
I'm right here.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:28.940
You're right.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.190
Why did you choose a woman?

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.660
We couldn't find any male slaves who looked similar.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.700
Can you save her?

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.910
No. Not with where she got shot.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.040
If there was poison on the arrow, 
then she's probably already...

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.800
I'm sorry.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.390
Take care of her.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.930
Do everything you can.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:05.270
Yes.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.020
Well, you know...

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.280
Your precautions have paid off, Your Highness.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.320
It seems that there are people hiding here in York

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.370
who want to do you harm.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.160
I see.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.960
You want to get revenge.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:32.250
Yes. I'm going to kill him, no matter what.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.800
With my father's dagger.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.890
He's all beaten up.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.140
A young child survived on the battlefield.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.100
I'm sure he's seen hell.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.400
No. I can't.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.150
In order to save this child,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.440
I have to forget these last 11 years.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.570
Leif.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.870
What's happening in Vinland right now?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.450
My father had wanted to go there.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.250
I dream about it sometimes too.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.040
Did you build a village already?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.840
Why aren't you asking me about your mother 
and your sister, who you left behind?

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.970
After you left, Helga's health got worse.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.260
Go see her, Thorfinn.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.810
It would make Helga feel better--

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.560
I'm asking you about Vinland!

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.060
Don't talk to me about things I didn't ask you!

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.400
Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Thorfinn!

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.030
Let's go home, Thorfinn.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.330
You've had enough, right? Let's go home together.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.200
Enough?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.290
You have no idea.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.500
You don't know anything about

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.590
what I went through between that day and today.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.010
Right?

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.880
As long as Askeladd

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.720
is still alive, eating and shitting, it'll never be enough!

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.220
It'll never be enough!

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.610
How could this have happened?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.070
That cheerful young child.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.250
I'm going to stay in this town 
until you change your mind!

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.620
Thorfinn!

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.170
Let's go home!

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.510
Hey. Here's some booze.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.760
Thanks.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.970
Nice room, Bjorn. I'm jealous.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.520
This room is too small of a reward 
for risking my life.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.780
By the way, 
Atli said he wanted to apologize to you.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.280
I've got no hard feelings for anyone 
who cut me on the battlefield.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.040
Thorfinn's the only one who holds a grudge about it.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.330
I'm okay. So go.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.250
It's time for you to make your evil plans.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.750
Yeah. See you later.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.180
Askeladd.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.390
How is your leg?

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.310
Well, I've been hit by a lot of arrows.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.110
But, well...

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.150
It's good enough for me to hold a sword.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:47.860
I see.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.580
Then tomorrow.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.830
Okay.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.830
Tomorrow.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.880
We've been outwitted, Floki.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.970
I apologize.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.310
Askeladd? He's doing well.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.980
He's laid a curse on this town.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.530
The prince got killed?

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.820
No! It was a double.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.030
It's so dangerous out there.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.250
We can't sleep in peace at night.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.630
What I don't understand

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.800
is why the assassin was targeting the prince?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.380
Well, he's an important person!

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.300
Of course someone would want to kill him!

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.600
But King Sweyn is here!

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.230
If they were going to go after someone, it would be him!

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:58.850
Oh, you're right.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.810
And there are two heirs.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.610
So the fact that they went after the younger brother 
must mean that...

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:06.740
You there!

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.280
I have some interesting information regarding that.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.950
Well,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.750
it's only a rumor, after all.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.460
Only a rumor?

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.210
That's perfect.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.710
It's better not to offer definite proof.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.920
We should leave the king with some room.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.350
So you're the one who hired the assassin?

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.100
You performed a part in your own play?

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.100
It was some good acting, right?

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.060
Spreading rumors isn't enough.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:47.360
That acting made the rumor seem real. 
That's how the rumor will spread.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.860
Everyone knows of the dispute over succession 
within Denmark's royal family.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.160
Now, there's been an assassination attempt, 
and the rumors will spread.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.990
Well then, everyone.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.080
How is this going to affect tomorrow's meeting?

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.500
I see.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.630
He won't be able to issue any orders 
that would put me at a disadvantage.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.590
That's right.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.470
If he took Thorkell away from you,

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.010
or sent you to a warzone, it would only feed the rumors.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.390
The king depends on public favor.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:22.690
If he gets a bad reputation among the military, 
he won't be able to ignore it.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.110
Especially if they found out he murdered his own child.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.070
You're so cunning.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.570
Where did you learn how to do it?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.080
Brute force isn't the only way to fight.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.490
Did you learn something new?

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.790
The king might not strike

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.920
for the time being.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.380
It's a good way to buy time.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960
But

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.220
I won't let you use a double for me ever again.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.680
Yes. I apologize.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.930
I'm so impressed, Askeladd!

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.770
I feel like I have a force of ten thousand on my side!

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.110
Thanks.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.360
Well, it looks like our discussion is wrapping up.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.450
I'm going to run some errands now.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.410
Wow! Having him here is so reassuring!

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:20.740
Your Highness.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.330
You must not trust Gunnar.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.080
He's probably communicating with King Sweyn.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.090
Why do you think so? Tell me your reason.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.550
It's my gut feeling. But I'm sure about it.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.640
Then wasn't that bad just now? 
He'll find out about what we were talking about.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.050
I don't care.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.470
I've only talked about things that are superfluous.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:47.150
If Gunnar is on their side, then he's going to 
tell them tonight about what he just heard.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.480
I asked Thorfinn to follow him to make sure.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.860
What are you going to do if Gunnar is a spy?

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:55.650
Are you going to kill him?

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.450
Let him work.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.700
We'll use him to tell the king

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.960
that we don't want a short-term battle.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.670
If he hears it from his spy, he'll believe it, and relax.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.510
In order to avoid conflict for now, it's necessary to have 
an understanding from both sides.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.430
My plan is complete now.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.310
You're unbelievable.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.690
I'm looking forward to seeing 
the king's reaction tomorrow.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.490
That's the king's house.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:42.910
Now, we know for sure.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.880
Everyone's obsessed with deceiving each other.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.090
Is that what a warrior is supposed to do?

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.550
There's only one thing

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.260
I'm supposed to do.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.810
Do we really have to do this before the Imperial Council,

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.350
Thorfinn?

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.320
Wouldn't it be better to wait 
until your right arm heals?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.740
Well, I'm fine with it either way.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.830
I shall be the witness.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.460
The duel is over when I tell you to stop.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.130
You both agree with that?

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.670
Fine with me.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.670
But please wait a moment, Your Highness.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.300
I have a previous engagement.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.600
I will return later.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.520
Sorry, Thorfinn.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.780
We'll be done soon.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.280
Understood. Begin.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.760
Askeladd.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.480
You're strong and smart.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.810
I look up to you.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.190
Even though

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.860
you hate me from the bottom of your heart.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.910
Hey, Askeladd.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.540
I'm not the only one.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:51.660
You hated

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.750
our friends who died...

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.670
and even yourself.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.920
Aren't you lonely?

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.390
Rejecting everything

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:08.470
like that?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.140
I...

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.190
wanted...

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:18.270
Wanted...

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.490
to be friends with you.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.180
Sorry! I missed the vital spot! I'll put you at ease.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.560
Askeladd...

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.770
I wanted to be friends with you...

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.700
Yeah. Bjorn...

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.200
You're

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.410
my only

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:13.700
friend.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.510
Send me off.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.460
Well, then. Sorry to keep you waiting, kid.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:02.210
Come.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:08.970
I'll play with you.
