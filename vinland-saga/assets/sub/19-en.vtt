WEBVTT

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.020
Hey! Are you okay?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.190
Who's that?

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.650
He's big.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.320
What about the duel?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.660
What did he say? Duel?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.330
Duel? This isn't the time to be sleeping!

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.750
He got up!

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.880
He's still alive!

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.300
Looks like you can still fight.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.210
UNITED FRONT

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760
I'll give you a minute to recover.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.180
Don't underestimate me! Come on! Attack me!

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.390
No. I can't fight you when you're like that.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.140
Shut up! I don't need your sympathy!

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.600
I was right. See?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.400
Hey! Old man! Stop!

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.650
Let him do it. Someone, bring a chair.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.160
Let me see.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.830
Stay away, baldy! Go treat your own wounds.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.870
Just let me see.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.290
Don't touch me!

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.460
Don't get so mad. It's a bad habit of yours. 
Use your head.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.760
What do you think you should do right now to win?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.800
I haven't had that much fun in a long time, Thorfinn.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.640
I'll tell you, just like I promised.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.970
About your father,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.730
Thors.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.160
You know who the Jomsvikings are, right?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.990
Thors and I were both commanders.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.330
Thors was particularly strong.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.880
The Jomsvikings don't accept average warriors.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.340
Thors was so good that they nicknamed him 
"The Troll."

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.220
Their leader, Sigvaldi, liked him and gave him 
one of his daughters.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.930
She's your mother, Helga.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.270
The leader of the Jomsvikings is my grandfather?

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.230
That's right. He's also my older brother.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.280
In other words, that means I'm your great-uncle.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.950
He's related to the captain? No way!

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.450
Our last battle was the Battle of Hjörungavágr in Norway. 
We lost that battle.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.210
During the naval battle, Thors fell into the sea 
and didn't come back up.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.920
I cried.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.590
I wanted to beat him someday. With my own hands.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.100
But Thors wasn't dead.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.850
The last time I saw him was in Jomsborg.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.190
987 BC 
JOMSBORG HOME BASE OF JOMSVIKINGS

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.020
It was three months after his funeral.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.770
Then he got scared and peed his pants.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.070
Seriously?

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240
The patrol just left. Let's go.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.450
Hey!

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.210
Are you guys thieves?

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.130
Did you know this house belongs to Thors, 
a leader in the Jomsvikings?

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.210
Thorkell.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.130
I usually leave thieves alone, but...

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.180
I just lost one of my friends.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.230
I've been in a bad mood these days.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.070
Thors? You-- What?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.700
Come on! Where have you been?

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.080
We held your funeral!

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay, okay. Calm down, Thorkell!

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.090
Sorry for making you worry.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.750
It's Helga!

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.130
What's wrong? You guys are both dressed 
in shabby clothes!

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.720
Excuse me, Uncle Thorkell--

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.350
I knew it! You'd never die over something 
as little as falling into the sea!

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.310
Excuse me, Uncle. We--

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.230
Have you seen my brother yet? No? 
All right! I'll go wake him up for you.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.600
Thorkell.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.900
Listen to me.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.230
Okay! Let's catch up inside.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.360
What's wrong?

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.040
I'm not going to see the leader.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.040
We're leaving here.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.580
To do what? You can leave tomorrow! 
You just came back.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.750
I'm leaving...

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.010
this town and the Jomsvikings.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.470
Please forget that you saw me tonight.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.640
What? Is this a joke?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.980
Just pretend that I'm dead.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.560
Please, Thorkell.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.320
I don't understand. What are you talking about?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.410
I've decided.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.000
I'm not going to fight anymore.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.330
I said I don't understand!

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.250
You're not scared because you almost died, right?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.170
My brother is considering you as his successor.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.380
Sorry.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.100
You're tired, right? Just eat something 
and go to sleep for today.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.100
Now I understand.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.610
I understand what a real warrior is.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.110
So, I can't stay here anymore.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.500
You know the rules, right? Anyone who leaves without 
the leader's permission will be sentenced to death.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.930
This is the capital of warriors.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.640
You don't know how to do anything except fight. 
Where are you going?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.220
Somewhere, but not here.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.230
Thors.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.650
It'll be okay. Stay back.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.110
Take care, Thorkell.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.700
Where's your sword?

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.530
I don't need it.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.380
When I woke up, Thors was already gone.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:39.180
Fifteen years later, I found out that 
Thors had really died.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.390
I thought about him for 15 years.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.980
I realized that whether the body is still alive 
or not doesn't matter.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.150
What's important for a warrior is where their soul is.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.910
His soul had gone somewhere far away.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.240
I don't understand it yet.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.830
Somewhere I can't reach yet.

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.960
Somewhere, but not here.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.590
He probably became a real warrior there.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.260
Thorfinn. How did he spend his time in Iceland?

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.550
Tell me.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.640
I don't want to.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.020
I told you what I know!

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.600
Shut up! I don't care.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.730
You cheapskate! It's not that you don't want to tell me. 
You actually don't know.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.570
I can tell by looking in your eyes. You don't have 
that same mysterious sparkle he does.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.490
What did you say?

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.580
You didn't learn anything from Thors. 
And you're embarrassed that I'd find out, right?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.540
Wait.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.580
Let go! I'll kill everyone starting with you!

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.040
You'll lose if you fight like you usually do.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.170
See?

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.640
Whether you win or lose will decide whether I live or die.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.180
That's why I'm going to tell you

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.180
how to defeat that monster.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.850
Don't bullshit me, baldy!

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.770
If you knew how to beat him, why didn't you fight him?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.110
Battle isn't the same as Shogi.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.950
It's not over just because you beat their captain.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.540
But this is different. He said if you win, he'll let us go.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.120
He values honor. He'll keep the vow he made 
before the duel.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.750
Remember the reason you fight.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.960
It's to beat me in a duel, right?

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.260
Let me be your advisor, just this once.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.230
So that the two of us can survive this situation.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.660
I wanted to see the captain's duel.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.040
If I die, I want to die in a duel with the captain, too.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.540
I'd be proud in Valhalla.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.710
He's on a different level. I bet he's a reincarnation 
of Thors, the god of lightning.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.710
If the captain is Thors, then does that mean 
Prince Canute is Freyja?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.260
She's a goddess!

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.350
It's a reincarnation of Freyja!

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.970
Take this!

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.810
Does that hurt, Thorfinn?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.860
Why don't you just forget about Askeladd and surrender?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.290
You bastard!

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.580
Don't run away!

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.290
You don't know when to quit!

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.800
Look at you! Fight to the end with pride!

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.800
Are you trying to disgrace the name of Thors?

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.680
Damn!

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.800
Bear it for now, Thorfinn.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.600
Get him to come closer.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.940
Was it the Battle of Maldon?

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.610
It was a fierce battle.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.070
Even Thorkell was severely wounded.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.450
It was only a moment.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.080
It was only a moment, but I saw it.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.380
I saw the moment that Thorkell the Invincible collapsed.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.560
That was good. Make him think that you've used up 
everything you got.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.980
What's wrong, Thorfinn? 
Are you tired of running away now?

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.520
I'm so disappointed.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.650
I thought you had more spirit in you.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.860
You're in a good spot. Good job, Thorfinn.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.870
That was over fast.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.030
Pathetic.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.330
He ran away the whole time.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.910
That's right, Thorkell.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.870
Come finish him off.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.460
All that's left is...

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.920
for you to let your guard down for a moment.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.180
His weakness is...

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.750
Captain!

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.210
You idiot! You don't have a weapon!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.510
Thorfinn! On your right!

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.760
Kill that kid!

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.010
Damn!

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.270
Die, kid!

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.060
Stop, you fools!

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.650
You bastards... How dare you humiliate me!

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.570
Captain!

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.780
How dare you tarnish my duel!

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.830
Asgeir, you...

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.630
What about your honor as a warrior?

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.590
I don't care if you hate me for it. 
I'm going to kill that kid.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.470
If you want to kill me, then kill me!

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.470
But you must live!

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.760
No one else

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:55.770
could unify these 500 beasts!

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.520
Stop right there.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.570
You must not fight anymore.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.490
Whoever dies in this fight

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.620
will die in vain.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.830
Impossible...

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.710
They've been annihilated... Askeladd's army has been...

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:32.760
Brother!

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.770
You're alive!

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.520
Who are you?

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:46.610
Brother...

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.410
How can you kill each other without end? 
Don't you tire of it?

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.540
I don't care if you're royalty. 
You have no right to spoil the duel.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:59.790
Stay back, little girl.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.790
It doesn't look like a duel anymore.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.800
If you're a leader, you should show your men 
pride and honor.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.260
Silence! I don't need you to tell me what I already know!

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.950
Let Thorfinn go. I lost this duel.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.620
Captain! You haven't lost! We just got in the way!

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.530
Shut up, you idiots!

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.330
I lost. I should preserve my dignity.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.250
Asgeir...

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.380
Do as the captain commands.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.010
That was unpleasant.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.100
I've been alive for 50 years, but I've never 
had a day as bad as today.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.470
Booze!

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.350
Hey, baldy! Let's get away right now!

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.690
If you want to go, then go. I'm staying.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.650
What? What do you think I went through all that for?

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.110
Just shut up and watch.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:21.950
So? Who do you think you are, prince? 
Did you just stroll over to break up the fight?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.620
I wish to have your sled and your supplies.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.000
And Thorfinn and Askeladd are my followers.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.040
I'm taking them.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.090
Are you stupid?

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.970
What kind of a hunter would let his prey get away?

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.180
You intend to use me to bargain 
with King Sweyn.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.270
Is that what you're thinking?

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.480
Yes, prince.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.900
You're bait. You're a hostage. 
And you're a source of money.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.690
Forget about the prince! Don't get greedy!

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.150
Just watch!

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.410
Stay back, lout. I won't run away.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.790
You matured a lot in a short amount of time. 
What happened?

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.210
I found Ragnar's corpse in the village 
I stopped by yesterday.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.800
Thorkell.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.800
I have no value as a hostage.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.390
The reason being...

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.770
my father

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.310
doesn't love me.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.030
My father is going to give the throne 
to my brother Harald.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.650
I'm just second to my brother.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.280
However, that caused the vassals to start fighting,

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.830
and endangered the foundation of the kingdom.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.500
My existence

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.920
is a source of distress to the king.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:00.340
In other words, King Sweyn is hoping that I'll kill you?

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.930
It'd be better to have me die in battle 
than to assassinate me.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.810
It would allow my father to avoid killing his own child.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.400
If I did let you go right now, where would you go?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.110
To the main camp in Gainsborough.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.280
To fight my father, the king.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.870
You think you can win? Congratulations.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.830
I'm doing what should be done.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.170
My life isn't valuable anyway.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:47.810
I've seen lots of men who said 
they didn't care about their life.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.190
But most of them cry and beg for their life as soon as 
they get hit, even if it's just a light punch.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.190
You're just like them, right?

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.420
I hate that look in his eyes. I've seen it before.

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.890
What are you looking at with those eyes?

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.640
What happened? They got quiet.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.520
Men.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.780
Even I have one thing I regret.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:44.780
I regret not following Thors back there.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.120
If I had followed him then,

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.250
I would have learned 
the secret to being a real warrior.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.090
Well, I'm going to end up fighting King Sweyn anyway.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.590
All right! I've made my decision.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.430
I'll help you fight.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.560
I'm going to follow you.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.940
I'm going to watch what you do from now on, 
and who you'll become.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.190
But if you do anything soft, I'm going to kill you.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.570
Good. From today on, you, too, are one of my followers.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.660
Then what about us?

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.460
Well, the captain says he's going to follow him, so...

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.170
What's wrong with him? 
What's he still doing here?

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.110
Your Highness Canute.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.740
I'm the one who killed Ragnar.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.110
Please kill me.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.580
However,

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.410
if you let me live,

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.040
I shall help you,

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.250
even if it costs me my life.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.890
Work on his behalf, too. 
That's how you shall mourn his death.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.140
Certainly.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.150
If you want to come with me, then come.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.940
We're going to drag King Sweyn down from the throne.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.110
What are you doing? Don't copy me.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.910
I'm not. I'm the one who became his vassal first.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.950
Anyway, let's be friends.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.080
I killed most of your men, 
but it's water under the bridge, right?

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.010
Letting it be water under the bridge 
is the only thing you can do.
