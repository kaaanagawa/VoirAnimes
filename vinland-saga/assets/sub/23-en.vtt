WEBVTT

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.570
1014 A.D. 
NORTHUMBRIA REGION, YORK

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.370
DAY OF THE IMPERIAL COUNCIL

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.620
What's in there?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.670
It's wine.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.840
-There's so many soldiers here. 
-Of course there are.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.210
Miscalculation

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.760
The elders are going to gather here today.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.510
Wow, the elders are going to eat all this?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.960
What do you think?

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.380
That's not true.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.420
Anyway, when he was about to get stabbed, 
he didn't even notice!

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.270
What do you think about what happened the other day?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.780
Do you mean the assassination attempt 
on the prince?

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.700
I know it's awful to say this, 
but we can't ignore the rumors.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.700
I guess this means the king 
has chosen Harald, not Canute.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.160
Surely Canute's supporters are upset.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.710
You're talking too loudly!

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.590
It's still just a rumor.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.260
It looks like we must reconsider our plans.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.640
No. Thorkell has joined Canute.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.260
This more than compensates for the loss of Ragnar.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.140
Thorkell doesn't know how to govern.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.560
He's too much for Canute to handle.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.030
By the way, there's someone else who joined 
Canute, too.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.280
His name was Askeladd, "covered in ash."

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.070
Well, I've never heard of him.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.490
Lords!

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.450
Rise!

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.330
His Highness the king and His Highness the prince 
are about to enter the room.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.360
Well, lots of good food!

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.990
Where's Thorfinn?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.740
Well...

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.120
There's no need to feel worried for your safety.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.920
No one here is so foolish 
as to shed blood in this place.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.200
Hurry up and walk! Don't drag your feet!

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.510
You're a stupid kid.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.690
Whoa, hey!

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.420
Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.730
What? It's just a kid.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.270
Hey, wait!

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.900
How dare you touch me 
with those dirty hands of yours!

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.360
What's wrong with this kid?

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.320
Hey! Don't ignore me.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.080
Hey! Say something!

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.040
Hey, hey!

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.040
Are you making fun of us?

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.290
Pay up, you!

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.600
Hey, you--

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.070
Out of the way! Let us through!

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.450
You idiots!

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.080
You again!

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.420
You will be notified of your punishment later!

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.210
What a time to cause trouble!

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.550
Are you sure this is okay?

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.260
I heard he's the prince's guard.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.060
The prince is attending 
the imperial council right now.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.270
There's no way his guard would be 
walking around town.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.450
Elders of Denmark...

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.830
thank you for gathering here today.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.830
My long-awaited wish has finally come true.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:30.460
This land, England, 
has finally come under my control.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:35.550
This achievement is all thanks to your 
valiant efforts in battle.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.390
In addition, my old friend Thorkell...

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.730
and my son, Canute

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.570
have returned to us, 
thanks to the protection of the gods.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.940
This is an unexpected stroke of good fortune.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.820
I'm glad you've returned, Canute.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.240
Your father is happy.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.340
I'm going to put Mercia, part of our new territory, 
under your rule.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.010
Let's make this land a good country together.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.140
Thorkell.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.520
Support my son.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.180
This is my wish.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.100
Yeah.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.230
Mercia?

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.150
That's the most prosperous land within England...

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.150
Maybe the rumors were just rumors after all.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.780
No. You don't know that for sure. 
If the rumors really are true,

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.450
then of course he'd say that.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.620
I shall reward you as well in accordance with 
your achievements in battle.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.710
Let us continue to fight with valor 
in Ireland, our next battleground.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:58.140
Ireland is the land 
where our previous king, King Harald,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.220
was humiliated by Brian Boru, that insolent tyrant.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.690
Victory is mine!

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.610
The king is reacting just as I had expected.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.150
This proves he has no counter to my strategy.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.110
If it's a battle of wits, I'll come out ahead.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.660
Floki, I like that look on your face.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.250
Sorry, but I'm going to have you 
draw a losing ticket this time.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.420
I'm the one who's going to be in control of this fight.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.880
I have all the pieces. I can do it!

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.720
However...

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:49.310
this land still harbors impudent fools 
who show no respect for their king.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.190
I wanted to let you know about this matter.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.360
I sent a messenger to urge them 
to become my vassals.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:05.200
However, despite that, they refused twice.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:11.250
If they are sowing seeds of rebellion 
that would threaten our new territory,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:14.420
then we must do everything we can 
to nip it in the bud!

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.050
Wales.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.890
We shall show the inhabitants of Wales

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.980
the power of the true king.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.230
We shall attack in the coming spring.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.230
Be prepared.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.050
Get up.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.010
Do you hear me?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.390
Get up!

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.680
You have a visitor.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.640
Is it one of Canute's men?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.770
Send him away.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.360
What?

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.150
It's not one of the prince's messengers.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.820
It's just a sailor.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.620
Thorfinn.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.690
I heard from one of the traders

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.060
that someone who looked like you was taken away.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.900
I was in a panic, Thorfinn.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.740
It's none of your business.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.290
So, it's been 11 years?

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.840
How hard it must have been for you...

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.840
It's just as you say.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.340
I don't understand.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.390
As long as that man is still alive,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.690
your heart will never be at peace.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.860
If you say it's still not enough...

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.570
then you're probably right.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.160
But...

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.960
I still remember it as if it were only yesterday.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.880
The sound of the crackling fire in the hearth.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.510
The delicious smell of the soup.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.840
Thors.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.300
Helga.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.430
Ylva.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.270
And...

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.060
the smile on your face when you were a kid.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.990
I was telling you the story 
of how I got trapped in an ice floe

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.030
a long time ago in Brattalihd.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.540
I had run out of food 
and my ship had been destroyed.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.380
My six friends had all died.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:58.560
But I still kept walking across the ice.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:02.520
Do you know why?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.330
No matter how stormy the sea is,

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.910
no matter how frozen the sea gets...

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.270
a sailor is always fighting a battle against the sea.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.270
Just like a warrior...

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:50.110
with their own honor at stake.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.870
When Thors died...

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.500
when you disappeared,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.500
I swore on my honor.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:11.930
So, Thorfinn, I'm not saying this for you.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.340
I'm saying this for myself.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.760
No matter what happens,

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.560
I'm going to bring you back to Iceland, your home.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.100
It's my responsibility to Thors.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.820
Next, the lords of Schleswig.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.280
Son of Eirik, Ivar.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.830
Come forth.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:46.750
In appreciation of your achievements on the 
battlefield, the king is granting you silver and land.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.800
Accept his offering with gratitude.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.800
But he looks normal.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.560
Just now. It was only for a moment.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.730
He turned pale when he heard Wales mentioned.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:09.900
There might be something in Wales 
that turns out to be his weakness.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.280
Please take note.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.210
Don't be such a pig.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.330
What a disgrace.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.340
Shut up! I'm expressing my gratitude 
towards the god of harvest.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.670
Do you intend to get bigger 
than you already are? Unbelievable.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:36.970
Damn.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:42.520
What is it? What's going on, King Sweyn?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.350
Do you know about the connection 
between me and Wales?

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.230
No. That's not possible.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.360
I've never told Floki about it.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:57.320
Even if he did know, he wouldn't mobilize 
his entire army just to piss me off.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.910
So, it must be a coincidence.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.830
No. It doesn't matter.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:09.000
The real problem is that Wales 
is going to turn into a sea of fire in the spring.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.210
Damn.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.840
Think. I don't have time.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.640
How can I solve this before spring?

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.680
Should I lead a revolt with the prince?

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.770
No. Thorkell's army of 500 men 
are the only ones who I could count on.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.520
Our army doesn't have enough men.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.780
It would take some time to convince 
some of the generals to join me.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.070
I could instigate a rebellion among the English again.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.370
No. Wales would end up 
becoming the main battlefield anyway.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.740
Stop trying to think of a plan that involves a fight.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:48.250
One of the king's assassins might try to go after 
Canute in the midst of the confusion.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.970
Home.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.350
Don't talk to me about home now.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.570
Far, far to the west, across the sea...

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.740
there lies a new world 
where the trees are laden with fruit...

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:28.250
and grassy plains cover the land.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.720
It's Vinland.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.760
Thorfinn.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.470
It's Vinland!

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.150
After you go home and things have settled down, 
let's head for Vinland together!

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.240
Why?

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:05.070
You said it too, right?

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.830
You said that Thors wanted to go, too.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.540
Thors came to Iceland to escape battle.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.000
If he were still alive...

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.100
I'm sure he would have tried to go there, too.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.520
A place without slaves or war,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.400
where everyone can live in peace.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.320
A warm and fertile land.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.150
Let's build a country like that.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.080
If it's in Vinland...

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.330
If it's in Vinland, I'm sure we could do it!

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.060
By the way, speaking of Wales...

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.070
that's where you went when you were 
running away from me, right?

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.410
What was your trick?

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.160
Why did the people of Wales help you Danes?

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.550
My mother's grave is there.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.380
That land...

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.260
is my home.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.390
It's my country.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.730
The land is poor but the people are full of pride.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.980
It's the country my mother loved.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.570
I see.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.290
Well, you know, sorry to hear that.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.790
That information is just between us, tell no one.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.000
I know.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.800
His Highness Canute's vassal.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.800
Askeladd, son of Olaf.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.090
Come forth.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.020
Now what?

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.880
Why...

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:08.130
is luck never on my side in the 11th hour?
