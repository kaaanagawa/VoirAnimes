00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.980
Child of a Hero

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.830
My mother will die soon.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
She said she wanted to return to her hometown.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.630
I brought her here.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.860
NOVEMBER 1013 AD 
WESSEX, SOUTH OF ENGLAND

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.490
Our main army 
defeated the resistance at Wessex.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.910
It is only a matter of time until we conquer the land.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.250
If all goes well, everything will be done before winter.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.340
What happened to London?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.590
And Canute,

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.930
where is he?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.220
Yes.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.970
The besieging army that Canute was leading 
was attacked by Thorkell.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.980
We haven't heard anything since.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.940
I heard rumors they engaged in battle at Marlborough.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.480
It's possible they joined the local soldiers.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.150
However, we are not yet sure 
whether they got away safely.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.700
He's my dear son.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.290
As soon as you find out more, tell me immediately.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.500
Yes, sir.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.350
What?

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.100
We're surrounded!

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.310
It can't be.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.480
See? I told you so!

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.110
Damn!

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.360
Calm down, men!

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.280
Listen well! Don't return fire. Don't touch them!

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.700
Messengers of Brycheiniog!

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.210
What a rough welcome!

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.920
So you speak our language, you barbarian.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.340
I heard that you Danes were just like beasts 
that can't talk.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.220
Withdraw your troops, Asser.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.180
Making trouble with the Danes 
is of no benefit to Wales.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.680
Gratianus!

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.400
I respect your concern 
for the future of the kingdoms of Wales.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.490
But our values are different from yours.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.280
What promise are you trying to make 
with the prince of the Danes?

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.580
They're just barbarians! They have no morals!

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.750
What is he shouting about?

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.620
Are we going to fight or not?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.960
No. This isn't going to turn into a battle.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.210
Do you understand what he's saying?

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.760
No, I don't.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.510
But they could have killed one of us with their first shot 
if they wanted to.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.220
They were trying to intimidate us

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.850
so that they could control the negotiations.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.520
I see.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.770
You beasts!

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.990
I watched your war with England closely.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.110
You entered three cease-fire agreements 
in the last ten years,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.910
and violated them all!

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.410
We will not make the same foolish mistake as England!

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.170
We shall capture the prince and use him as a shield!

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.300
Even the king of the devils 
must still love his own child!

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.670
Sorry, Askeladd.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.340
No. It's just an act.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.180
He's just making trouble to see how we'll respond.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.770
These days, a sheep must wear a wolf's skin to graze.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.230
I feel sympathy for them.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.730
Are you going to tell them about your plan?

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.570
I could...

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.660
but if they want to put up an act, 
I can go along with them.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.170
Look closely!

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.250
The man standing here

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.590
is none other than the son of King Sweyn of Denmark,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.090
His Highness Canute.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.600
His Highness will now address you.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.020
Be silent and listen!

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.480
All right, Your Highness. Say something spirited.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.570
It can be anything. Like, "I'm going to boil you 
alive and eat you."

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.070
Make those rude scoundrels uncomfortable.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.620
If it comes from you, their balls will shrink 
and they'll let us through.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.590
Your Highness!

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.510
His Highness dislikes talking in front of other people.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600
I shall do it instead--

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.970
No, Ragnar.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.350
What?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.190
He may be young, but he's still a prince.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.230
He has responsibilities he must live up to.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.610
Everyone standing here now

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.650
is acting for the prince.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.530
He is a gentle person.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.240
He doesn't like unnecessary fighting.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.120
That's exactly why

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.710
I'm asking him to do this. 
To avoid an unnecessary fight!

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.750
Do you think you can handle succeeding

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.550
King Sweyn with your mouth clamped up like a clam?

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.840
Silence!

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.930
You could never understand His Highness!

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.810
The palace is a fox nest where parents, children, 
and siblings eat each other!

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:05.610
Do you have any idea how hard it was for 
the frail and sickly prince to survive through that?

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.280
He silenced his heart, silenced his breath,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.610
and made sure he didn't stand out. 
That's how he survived!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.700
And even after all that, he's still approached

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.290
by bastards like you who want to use him!

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.630
Don't step out of line.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.630
It's not your place to try to control how he acts.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.100
What's wrong?

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.600
What are you arguing about?

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.860
What does Canute say?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.530
Gratianus.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.740
I'm going to tell them the plan.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.580
Very well. I shall go too.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.500
Guys! Wait right there.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.500
I'm going to go talk to their leader.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.170
Okay.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.000
Ragnar.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.760
You are correct.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.050
I was worried about the prince,

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.890
and ended up overstepping my bounds.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.140
Your Highness, please forgive me.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.670
You loser. Are you really the same age as me?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.760
That man is named Ragnar, right?

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.260
Yes.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.310
He doesn't know that fledglings all leave 
the nest someday.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.150
What he's doing is actually bad for the chick.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.570
There are many things you have to do 
to put your plan in motion.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.200
The first is to make the chick leave the nest.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.200
Yes. I know.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.840
Stay back. I don't need any guards.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.050
But...

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.050
Don't make me say it again.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.680
It would bring shame to our king if they thought 
I can't talk without guards.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.230
More! Get five times further away!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.900
Tell the others too!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.070
All right.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.660
You said your name was Askeladd, right?

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.120
I understand your situation, 
but you're putting me in a hard spot.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.330
I heard that he's already agreed.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.750
You're asking for permission for passage 
through our country and supplies for your men.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.590
I can't agree immediately.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:24.050
We may be small, but our king also has a reputation.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.560
What's in it for us if we help you?

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.810
I need to confirm that this is a transaction between 
two parties of equal standing.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:38.240
Or else my men will think that the king is scared 
of only 100 Danes.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.740
You're right.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.080
It wouldn't look good for you 
if you just agreed to our demands.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.910
I apologize for not showing more consideration.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.380
I'm the one who wrote the letter to your country.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.040
I thought I wrote in the letter that I can't give details

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.420
about your reward 
in order to maintain secrecy.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.300
Yes. I read that.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.010
Then may I ask about that secret?

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.640
Can I ask you something?

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.480
Depending on the reward I offer you,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.400
would you consider joining us in the war, Asser?

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.740
Don't be silly!

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.200
I know that a small country like us

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.410
is no match for the king of Denmark!

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.290
Pardon me. I was just checking.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:39.840
He's a weird guy.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.510
-Who? 
-Askeladd, of course.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.640
I didn't know he could speak Welsh.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.730
I guess there's some things even you don't know.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.810
Idiot. There's lots I don't know.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.030
All I know is that he's from Denmark.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.610
He's such a pain.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.160
We've been together for decades, 
but he never tells me anything.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.240
Are you sulking about it? I thought you're a grown man.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.910
Shut up! Are you trying to start a fight?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.460
Calm down.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.590
Who cares? He's a good leader.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.550
And luck is on his side. 
As long as he lets me make money,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.470
I don't care where he's from. I'll follow him.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.310
That's hard to believe.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.770
But it's too unbelievable to be a lie.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.110
He's Lydia's child.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:50.160
Askeladd has inherited the blood of the great leaders 
of the Roman Celts.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.910
Then you're not a Dane?

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.580
I'm of mixed Danish and Welsh blood.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.590
My father Olaf conquered the coast of Wales 
in the past

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:06.510
and carried away Lydia as his concubine.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.930
I was their child.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.770
I had heard that the bloodline of the war gods 
of Old Britannia had gone extinct.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.560
Are you saying you're a descendant of Artorius?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.990
Artorius

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.320
was the commander of the Britannia army,

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.450
a country of native Celtic inhabitants of England

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.830
in the fifth and sixth centuries.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.960
In 516,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.370
he defeated the invading Saxons

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.750
and the English

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.630
at the Battle of Baden Hill

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.300
and brought peace to Britannia.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.640
Legends about him were passed down.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.890
He was the person that the legend of King Arthur 
was based on.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.940
Do you have any proof

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.980
of your story?

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.230
It's me.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.650
When he was 14,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.120
he visited Wales with Lydia and met me for the first time.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.290
She was an unlucky person.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.090
She was kept in my father's bedroom for a long time.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.260
After she became sick, she was kept in the stable.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.930
That's terrible.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.260
But who would ever imagine

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.270
that the last remaining survivor of the great bloodline

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.560
is mixed with Danish blood?

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.810
That's exactly it, Asser.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.900
It's because I'm of mixed blood...

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.690
I blend in with the Danes.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.160
In other words, Wales is going to have

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.660
an insider in the army of Denmark, me.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.620
If I can make that rich boy into the next king of Denmark,

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.960
then I can claim a high position too.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.500
If that happens,

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.220
I can conclude a treaty of non-aggression with Wales.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.300
I won't let them...

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:20.020
take even one step into this land.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.940
My goodness! That's so bold!

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.320
You almost had me!

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.160
-Asser is laughing. 
-He's confident.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.290
I have one concern.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.880
You were raised among the Danes.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:55.680
Are you sure the blood of Artorius is stronger 
than the blood of the Danes within you?

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.770
You'll just have to believe me.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.310
Regardless of my blood...

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.990
I hate the Danes.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.450
Put your swords here.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.700
You'll give them back, right?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.210
I refuse.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.670
I can't let go of my weapons!

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.500
We're just pretending to be their prisoners

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.380
while we pass through their country.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.350
They'll return our weapons when we get to the border.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.310
That way they won't lose face.

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:49.310
That's strange. 
Why do your men follow your orders?

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.480
It's amazing, right?

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.110
That's because my men trust me.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.160
Hey, Thorfinn. You too.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.570
Don't mess with me, baldy.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.830
You said trust?

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.160
He's different. You damn kid.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.920
Don't get the wrong idea, conehead.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.800
I'm not one of his men. I'm an enemy.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.800
An enemy?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.590
Fine. So be it. You two don't have to obey.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.720
It's only the two of you. I'm sure they'll allow it.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.390
All right! Let's start marching again!

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.360
Danes?

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.490
I heard Asser captured them!

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.750
-I heard they eat humans! 
-They look evil!

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.210
Asser is amazing.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.590
Let me try throwing a stone.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:54.750
Stop, you idiot!

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.340
They piss me off.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.260
They're treating us like animals.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.970
You better not look at us!

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.680
We're going to eat you!

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.440
Don't look, princess.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.990
If there's something you want to say, 
say it yourself.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.280
Don't you have a tongue?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.330
I...

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.420
I...

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.210
The reason I don't talk isn't because 
I'm a coward.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.840
I-- I'm cautious.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.100
I have to be cautious.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.850
I'm the prince.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.850
I'm different from you.

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.730
My words have political repercussions.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.030
Especially in a foreign country.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.910
Without permission from my father, the king,

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.370
I can't enter a treaty of non-aggression,

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.160
or say words to make them uncomfortable.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.550
I'm cautious.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.340
Not bad for an excuse.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:27.310
It looks like you're smart enough, princess.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.430
How dare you!

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.480
This is the first time!

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.360
No one's treated me like this before!

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.780
Then it was a good experience, right?

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.200
Take it back! It's not an excuse.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.950
You don't understand how hard it is to be 
from the royal family!

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.200
Stop barking. Sit down.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.240
I'm not barking!

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.540
I'm just declaring that I'm right!

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.210
Okay, I understand.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.460
What's wrong with your attitude?

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.590
I can't believe His Highness is talking to someone 
other than me!

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:02.920
I'm not your servant.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:45.840
Snow.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.600
Askeladd! Can't you go any faster?

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.520
We're going to be trapped in the snow!

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.110
Enough already. He's such a pain.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.870
We're going to cross the northern edge of Mercia

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.780
and head for the main army in Gainsborough.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.040
We'll arrive in one week.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.870
You mean we'll go through enemy territory?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.460
If we get trapped in the mountains of Wales in the snow, 
we'll be stuck.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.420
What's wrong? Don't worry.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.680
We're far away from the enemy's main camp.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.390
But how are you going to get supplies?

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.310
The lords in the countryside aren't going to 
help out a Dane!

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.180
It'll be fine.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.640
I've thought about that already.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.190
Men! We're changing directions! With haste!

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.950
-What? 
-Really?

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.200
We're changing routes all of a sudden?

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.790
Don't worry! Askeladd's decision isn't wrong!
