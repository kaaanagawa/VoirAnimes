00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.790
Thors.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.710
Helga.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.180
Thors.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.420
YEAR 987 HJÖRUNGAVÁGR

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.300
Why were you just standing there? 
Are you feeling unwell?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.420
Sorry. I dozed off.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.600
We're too spread out. We won't be able 
to hold off their second wave.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.850
Thorkell, when Floki approaches, 
bring up the frontline.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.360
You mean that blockhead?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.150
I don't mind. What about you?

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.400
I'm going to stop the enemy.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.030
Stop? What do you mean?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.370
How are you going to get there?

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.790
I see. You're nimble.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.420
Wait. You're sneaking off alone?

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.960
Maria. Sorry...

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.520
SOMEWHERE NOT HERE

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.590
YEAR 1002 ICELAND

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.610
Thorfinn, can you feed the sheep and milk the cow?

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.690
Okay.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.820
After leaving Markland,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.870
our ship sailed further south.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.290
"There are better lands."

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.710
That's what the wind was telling us.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.800
And then we found it.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.220
The new continent.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.070
A new world where fruit grows 
and grassy plains cover the land.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.700
I named that land.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.460
The name of that land is Vinland.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.970
So how about it, boys? 
Have a better opinion of me, Leif Ericson, now?

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.720
You're amazing, Leif.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.930
What happened next?

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.850
Was anyone there?

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.760
Was it warm?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.850
Was it bigger than Iceland?

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:45.810
Yeah. It was much bigger than this place. 
There was grass growing everywhere.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.490
We saw some Natives too.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.490
We couldn't understand each other, 
but we became friends.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.620
This feather headdress and pipe are gifts from them.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.040
Listen. See this thing here?

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.920
Only true warriors are allowed to wear it.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.090
Well, you know...

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.050
That's amazing.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.270
What? The kids are still awake?

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.270
Can I touch it?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.690
Sorry. I wanted them to hear Leif's stories.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.690
A true warrior? You really are amazing.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:36.780
Right? You're a good boy, Thorfinn. 
Why don't you come sail with me when you grow up?

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.570
What? I want to sail with you now.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.200
Now?

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.080
Something's not right, Leif.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.580
My grandfather told me

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.750
that Jormungand lives in the west, 
and eats any ship that dares approach.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.210
And beyond that, there's nothing.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.470
That's exactly why you should realize 
how amazing I am.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.890
See? This is the proof. I'm a true warrior.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.600
Leif, you're not a warrior.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.850
What? You don't know anything.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.560
The battlefield isn't the only place 
where warriors are found.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.690
Sailors fight against the sea. They're amazing.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.070
I knew it.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.990
Yeah.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.110
What?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.330
Everyone says you're just like a kid with a beard.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.080
You're always going on adventures, 
and you're useless in battle.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.420
You just can't think for yourself. 
Thorfinn, you believe me, right?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.800
Do you mean I'm just a wandering old man 
who can't fight?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.720
You don't believe me?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.470
Well, it's true that my father is a warrior...

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.320
Thors. These kids think I'm a fool. 
Beat some sense into them.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.530
All right. That's enough for today.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.320
Ari, send them home.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.870
Yes, Thors.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.700
See you later.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.870
Bye.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.930
I see. Several people froze to death in Greenland.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.440
Yes. The cold wave will be severe this year. 
A lot of livestock will die.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.020
The problem is that it gets harder 
to endure the cold as you get older.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.570
It's so cold.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.240
Thanks.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.580
These two are the only ones getting weak.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.250
You must be cold, Ylva. I'll warm you up.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.460
You pervert.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.840
Mother, go to sleep. You'll catch a cold again.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.590
-I'm fine. Can you help me tie up the sheep? 
-Okay.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.760
Looks like life is tough here too.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.350
Yeah.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.600
Someday we might get a winter so cold 
that no one survives.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.480
Back in my country, 
my brother is making plans to emigrate right now.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.820
It's far, right?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.150
What?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.490
I made the round trip.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.540
Go. Vinland is near.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.960
-Captain Thorfinn. 
-What?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.960
It's Jormungand.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.920
Bring it on, you monster.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.010
That hurts.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.900
Sister. Sleep in your own bed. 
There's not enough room.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.690
What? I don't want to.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:02.320
That's not fair. I'm the one who warmed up this bed.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.740
They're still talking.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.080
Don't pay attention to them. Worrying is for adults.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.960
Come over here. I'll give you a hug.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.560
Hey, Father. Why can't we get a slave?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.900
Mother's health is poor. 
And now I have to help with the chores.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.020
That's not what we do. 
Stop asking the same thing every year.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.740
You're so weird.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.120
Ylva.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.750
I thought I was going to die.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Are you hurt?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.130
I'm fine.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.380
What's wrong?

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.920
There's something under here.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.630
Ylva?

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.330
Hey, old man. 
How much of your story yesterday is true?

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.330
What are you talking about? It's all true.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:46.840
Then take me on this ship. 
I'll believe it if I see it with my own eyes.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.840
Idiot. That's not what it means to believe.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.600
If you want to ride a boat, then go ask your father.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.940
Our warship is sitting over there. 
Our village has been using it for many generations.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.770
I'm sure your father would be happy to lend it to you.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.820
My father's so stingy. He always says no, 
no matter how many times I ask.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.280
He's not being stingy.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.530
The ocean here is scary, Thorfinn.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.540
I got trapped in an ice floe once, when I was young.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:24.750
I had just moved to Greenland. I was careless.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:30.380
We ran out of food in no time. 
We ate ice to make us forget our hunger.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.050
Our boat was finally crushed by the ice.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.060
We were left with no choice but to walk on the sea.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.650
And then one day, I noticed I was the only one left.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.820
My six companions were all dead.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.200
Why?

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.290
Why do we live so far north, 
if we have to go through all this?

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.760
Helga. Boil some water. Ylva. Bring the fur blanket.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.800
Okay.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.130
Oh, no. What happened?

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.760
He was buried in the snow.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.650
That looks like it hurts. What happened to him?

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.530
Add more wood to the fire.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.730
Okay.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:36.320
Hey, Father. Isn't he already dead? 
His hands and feet have already rotted.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.450
That guy's dangerous.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:47.040
He's not from our village. Poor thing. 
Why was he outside in the blizzard?

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.590
Why?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.430
He's a runaway slave. 
You'll get in trouble if you hide him.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.230
We ran away.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.600
My ancestors used to live much further 
to the east, a long time ago.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.610
In a land called Norway.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.450
It's warmer than here. The sea doesn't freeze.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.030
It's a good land, protected by many coves.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.830
But one day, a powerful man named Harald appeared.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:28.960
Harald's forces conquered our villages 
like a raging fire.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.130
He proclaimed himself to be the first king of Norway 
and became its ruler.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.630
He forced the people to choose

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:42.810
whether they would obey the king, or leave Norway.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.900
Many people hated Harald's tyranny.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.770
They moved to a faraway land, 
away from Harald's reach.

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:54.150
They came here, to Iceland.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.530
You're lying.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.870
You're a liar.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.250
My father and my ancestors would never run away.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.750
Stupid old man. You wandering old coot.

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:20.470
Father.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.730
Father. Listen to me. Leif said...

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.570
Welcome back, Thorfinn.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.240
Who is he?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.240
He's someone else's slave. He ran away.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.290
He came back to life.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.420
Hey, you. Can you say your name?

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.380
I'm so cold.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.340
The fire. Ylva, get the fire going.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:58.760
Oh, okay.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.510
Where did you come from?

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.230
Are you going to make me go back...

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.520
to Halfdan's household?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.190
Halfdan? You came from the other side 
of the mountains?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.820
I hate it there.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.780
I hate it.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.870
But...

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:25.740
I don't...

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.870
have anywhere else to go.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.800
Thors. Come. Halfdan is down at the harbor.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.800
Those guys came to pick a fight again. 
You're the only one who can handle him.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.850
They said something about a slave. 
They forced their way onto shore.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.980
Leif is trying to intervene, 
but I'm afraid he'll start a fight.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.860
Just come.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.160
Chains are the only type of necklace 
that looks good on a human.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.240
Not gold. Not silver.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.700
An iron chain.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.420
A chain around a man's neck 
is the only way to make him half decent.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.510
Don't you agree?

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:27.260
Last night, one of my slaves cut his chain 
and ran away.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.140
Do you know anything about this?

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.850
Stop trying to pick a fight with us.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.610
You're just trying to drag up old fights again.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.820
-We've had problems with him before. 
 -What a bunch of sissies.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.990
-We had a mediation the other day. 
 -You think your numbers scare us?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.450
You brat. I remember you.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.870
You cut off my left arm during that one fight.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.250
How dare you cut off my brother's leg?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.630
Stop, Ari.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.250
My brother will never be able to walk again. 
I'm going to chop off your leg.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.180
Bring it on. Who cares about the law? 
Who cares about the town assembly?

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.810
Halfdan...

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.890
I'm going to tie you up, you bastard.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.070
I won't let anyone get away with breaking the law.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.660
The law is a chain.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.080
The only way to make a heretic a human is 
to bind him with the law.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.750
Don't forget.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.510
The runaway slave is a young Slav.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.340
Have you seen him?

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.140
Where am I?

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.820
I've never felt so peaceful before.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.280
Hang in there. Hey, you.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.410
Stay awake. Or you'll die.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.490
Thors.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.420
Dad.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.670
Mom. Sister.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.220
You were all here.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.890
I was worried about you.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.510
We all got sold to different places.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.060
Where am I?

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.310
Why am I...?

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.360
Far, far to the west,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:50.660
across the sea, there's a land called Vinland.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.700
It's warm

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.910
and fertile.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.380
It's a faraway land, 
without slave traders and without war.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.920
What do you think?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.220
Come live there with us someday.

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.680
Vinland...

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.560
I see...

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.980
This land is called Vinland.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.670
I found him. Pardon my bad manners, Thors.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.550
I'm the rightful owner of that slave.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.130
Give him back to me.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.130
Father...

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.550
Come, Thorfinn.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.760
Halfdan.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.390
You know...

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.680
We weren't trying to hide him.

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.690
We saved your slave when he was about to die.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.980
Halfdan. How much did you pay for this man?

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.030
Father, it's rude to ask that.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.160
Two sheep. Both young ewes.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.910
I'll give you three sheep. I'll buy him.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.660
What do you think, Halfdan?

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.420
I'm bringing him back.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.210
I have to torture him in front of the other slaves 
to make sure they learn their lesson.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:35.680
Then I'll give you four sheep.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.930
You bastard. Didn't you hear what Halfdan said?

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.020
Shut up.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.100
What if I said I want twice that many?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.030
I'll pay. I'll give you all ewes. Under 3 years old.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.410
Eight sheep for a man who's good as dead?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.960
That was a good deal.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.300
No way. The deal's closed?

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.300
I bet you think you freed him from his chains.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.850
Where are you going to take him now?

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.400
I'll be the one to choose the sheep.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.830
Sister. Are you sad?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.000
Of course I'm sad. He cost eight sheep. 
But he died right afterwards.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.760
Father, you idiot.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840
Father.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.970
Did we run away too?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.890
Leif told me...

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.940
that our ancestors fled here from the east.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.690
He said they ran away and came here.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.950
Yes. That's what they say.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:22.950
Then...

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.380
Then where does everyone 
who wants to run away from here...

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.880
go?
