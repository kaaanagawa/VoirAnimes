WEBVTT

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.490
Hey. Don't we have any more booze?

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.700
It's my painkiller.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.120
Damn.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.160
Aren't we there yet?

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.580
That place where they're supposed 
to give us the money.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.120
Don't be in such a hurry. 
We're almost there.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.340
The Troll's Son

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.900
Damn.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.410
Damn it.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.380
-My whole body hurts. 
-I want to find me a nice girl.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.840
ENGLAND 
VICINITY OF HUMBER RIVER

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.510
Who's going to watch the ships?

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.590
We're just here to rest our bones.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.640
We're not going to stay here for long.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.200
Get up.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.320
Hey. Don't run away. 
I'll kill you if you move.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.410
Don't let anyone get away. 
We're going to have trouble if this gets out.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.330
Two on the right.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.430
And then the guy ate it. 
He didn't even know what it was.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.340
-My head hurts. 
-I drank too much.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.600
What happened? 
Did you have a hard time falling asleep?

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.980
There was a noisy little fly in my room.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.110
A little fly?

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.610
Who's that? A survivor?

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.740
No. It's the son. The Troll of Jom's kid.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.990
He's still alive?

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.410
Too much trouble for the early morning.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.460
This is revenge for my father.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.250
I challenge you to a duel.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.040
Impressive, kid.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.880
I'm so scared.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.010
What are you going to do, Askeladd?

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.390
What a pain.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.760
Come on.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.480
You should have cut off my head 
while I was asleep.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.020
I'm the son of Thors.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.030
I'd never do something

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.490
so cowardly.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.990
Wow, I'm so scared.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.000
-Did you hear that, Askeladd? 
-Kill him, kid.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.120
Get him.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.540
So, you think you're a warrior?

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.170
All right. Come at me.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.850
Yeah. Just like that.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.360
Someone dig him a grave.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.110
Damn. Damn.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.320
You can't let your sword 
swing you around like that.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.660
You're so brutal.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.710
Maybe he's dead already.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.920
Come on.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.560
We confirmed it.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.980
Here's your money.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.730
Thank you very much.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.740
Say thanks to Floki for me.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.290
I can't get too friendly with the villagers.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.420
By the way, I have a message for you.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.290
A message?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.550
"How was Thors's final moment?"

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.970
It was nothing special.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.350
He just died a normal death.

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.820
What? You're still alive?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.320
You look terrible.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:19.530
Want some?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.330
It's not healthy to deprive yourself.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.460
What's wrong with him?

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.220
We were only trying to help.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:46.350
Damn.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.140
Damn it.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.940
Damn it all.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.030
He died an honorable death.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.410
Thors sacrificed himself for us.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.710
I'm sorry, Helga. Ylva.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.290
My words cannot express how sorry I am.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.550
He's already dead. 
No one can do anything about it now.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.760
Crying about it will just make you hungry.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.150
Time to get back to work.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.400
Helga.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:21.610
Thorfinn...

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.740
I'm going to find him, no matter what.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.330
No matter how many years it takes.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.750
Well, I never thought he'd live a long life anyway.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.880
It's hard having a strange dad like him.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.880
Your little brother is missing, too, right?

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.840
Are you okay, Ylva?

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.890
I'm so busy, now that the men are all gone.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.600
Ylva.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.020
Yeah.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.560
You're crazy, Ylva.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.940
Mother, how are you feeling?

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.200
Yes. I feel much better.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.160
Sorry to rely so much on you, Ylva--

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.070
Okay, okay.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.740
It's okay. Don't get up.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.790
Oops, I forgot about the sheep.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.840
Okay, okay. Sorry I'm late.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.220
I must shear the sheep when spring comes too.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.070
Yeah.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.820
I got the first hit.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.990
I'm so busy.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.580
We don't have enough people to pitch in.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.370
Maybe I should get a husband.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.550
Thanks.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.840
Let's go to sleep.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.930
You can go to sleep first.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.800
I'm going to finish this.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:15.980
But it's dark already.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.810
You'll make a mistake.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.310
Ylva.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.950
That's enough.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.120
Get some rest.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.740
But I'm almost done.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.830
I'm okay. I'm not tired.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.360
I'm going to kill him.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.240
I'm going to kill him, no matter what.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.800
Hey.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.470
You're working hard.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.550
You.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.430
How is it?

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.470
Have you gotten used to using a sword?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.440
You. It's your fault.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.270
You used me as a shield.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.440
That's why my father...

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.190
You coward.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.570
Your father really was strong.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.370
But he was naive.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.700
That's all there is to it.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.580
Don't make fun of my father!

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.930
Well. You're just weak.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.770
Hey.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.940
I ran into that kid in the forest.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.070
What? He's still alive?

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.740
The blood of the Troll of Jom runs through his veins.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.950
He's not going to die that easily.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.630
Like father, like son.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.830
You can't let your sword 
swing you around like that.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.380
Damn.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.990
We ended up staying here for a long time.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.490
I feel great now.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.540
What a comfortable village.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.620
Someone's coming.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.720
I'm Thors' son, Thorfinn.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.590
In the name of Odin, the Almighty,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.850
I challenge you to a duel.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.850
Come on. You're so annoying.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.640
You're pretty brave.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.730
Accept the duel, Askeladd.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.150
It's decided, then.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:01.200
It's the leader's job to meet his men's expectations.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.660
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf, 
swear in the name of Odin

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.830
that I accept your duel, 
because I have no choice.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.760
Come on.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.340
Are you that eager to go meet your father?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.970
It's over.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.510
He can't win.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.310
Come on.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.390
Have you finished?

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.810
How boring.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.440
Get up.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.820
This is a duel.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.320
I think that's enough. He's going to die.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.580
What's wrong? 
You're the one who told me to kill him.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.560
That's it. I've had enough.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.730
I don't enjoy killing kids.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.190
Why?

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.530
What do you mean?

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.200
I'm busy too.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.410
Wait.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.370
I haven't lost.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:13.830
Fight. You coward.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.160
You're persistent, kid.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.920
It's not over yet.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.960
It's not over until I kill you.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.590
I swear, I will kill you.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.760
Try achieving something great on the battlefield.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.970
You're a Viking, right?

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.730
Then...

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.270
I'll reward you with a duel.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.280
That's a promise?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.030
Right. A promise between warriors.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.540
I'll achieve something in no time.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.210
And then...

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.670
you'll die...

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:09.180
by my hands.
