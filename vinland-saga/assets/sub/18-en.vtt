00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.480
I can see it.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.190
I'm fine.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.910
I can dodge it if I watch closely.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.540
If I don't get hit, 
it doesn't matter what weapon he uses.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.630
Yeah!

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.130
Nice, kid!

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.300
You can do it!

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.390
That kid's pretty good!

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.640
He was able to hit the captain.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.890
Quick guys like him are tough!

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.600
This could turn out to be a good fight!

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.480
Damn! I can't cut him. 
He's wearing chain mail underneath.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.070
Too bad, I liked these.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.620
So, you're not afraid of my ax?

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.450
You have a lot of guts. You're just like Thors.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.960
You big bastard. Who are you to my father?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.590
He didn't tell you? That's so cold of him.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.890
I heard he's descended from a jarl. 
He was of noble origin.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.930
Helga's the one from a family of jarls.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.850
Thors rose through the ranks 
because of his skill with the sword.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.100
What?

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.360
Do you want to know more?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.610
Do you?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.280
If you want me to tell you,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.870
you'll have to entertain me some more.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.240
All right, Thorfinn?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.250
I can entertain you.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.790
But it's going to be hard holding back enough 
to make sure you can still talk.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.380
Do you know what you're saying, kid?

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.760
My stomach hurts!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.430
Holding back on the captain? You?

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.430
Go easy on us!

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.970
You're an idiot! You're an idiot!

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.190
Was that funny?

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.270
I consider Thorfinn to be a warrior.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.530
Don't laugh!

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.910
Thors was stronger than me.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.950
Prove to me that you really are Thors' child,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.330
Thorfinn!

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.310
That stupid kid. He came back here to die.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.230
What happened to the prince?

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.280
Hey! Over there! Go!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.150
Hold down his leg!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.410
OUT OF THE CRADLE

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.570
Do the same over there!

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.040
I can hear the sound the of battle nearby.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.750
Stop it already!

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.880
Don't you have anything better to do?

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.260
Be quiet!

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.970
I don't want to open my eyes.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.640
I want to stay asleep...

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.560
like this... forever.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.940
Your Highness... Your Highness... 
Your Highness Canute.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.450
Ragnar! You're still alive--

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.090
This is a dream, isn't it, Ragnar?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.970
Yes. I came to say goodbye.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.440
Are you going? You'll leave me behind?

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.570
Are you telling me to live alone in a world like this?

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.580
Do you think I can survive?

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.880
I...

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.630
failed as the person tasked 
with your education.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.890
I was supposed to raise you as a jarl. 
But I raised you as a normal child,

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:37.430
like a farmer would raise his own child.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.650
Even though I knew that's not what the king wanted. 
Please forgive me.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:54.280
What's wrong with that? You understood my feelings 
better than my father, the king!

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.290
I never wanted to be born into the royal family.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.880
If I had been...

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.220
If I had been born as your son,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.770
everything would have been better.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.770
Your Highness.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.480
I'm so happy, Your Highness.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.200
Don't go. I love you.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.710
There are some things that you only realize 
once you've experienced a loss.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.220
You've noticed already.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.140
Ragnar...

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.350
I'm just a dream.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.260
Wait...

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.640
The time for you to awake has come.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.100
No... Ragnar!

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.440
Come back!

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.480
Come back!

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.780
I wish you well, Your Highness.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.160
Ragnar...

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.560
Don't be afraid! Attack together!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.480
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.330
Those men are fighting over you.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:01.160
The winner is going to take you.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.960
You're a priest. Aren't you going 
to stop them from fighting?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.550
Is there a way to stop them? It's better 
to let those who wish to die, die.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.890
I had a dream.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.520
It was a dream about Ragnar.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.480
He said goodbye.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.690
He was a faithful man, even in death.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.910
In this world...

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.040
there's no one who loves me anymore.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:52.380
You've found enlightenment. But you're wrong.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.050
Was the emotion that Ragnar felt towards you love?

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.100
In order to keep you safe,

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.390
he watched as 62 innocent villagers were killed.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.770
Your Highness.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.270
Love...

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.520
What is it?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.740
But you know, these guys weren't that good.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.290
It's not easy to find strong opponents.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.200
We'll never get to Valhalla.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.340
Is the captain's duel still going on?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.420
No way. He should have killed him instantly.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.960
Then what are they so excited about?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.010
I'll go check.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.050
Me too.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.640
Hey! What's going on?

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.850
Kill him!

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:45.770
Captain!

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:46.890
You kid!

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.140
Stop running away!

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.450
Impossible!

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.450
How could the captain...?

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.200
He's getting beaten up by that kid!

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.660
Nice, Thorfinn!

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.040
I don't even have five men who'd be a match for you!

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.760
It's the same chain mail as before.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.220
I should aim for tendons in his arms and legs.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.100
I tried to go after his vitals in London, 
and I paid the price.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.930
I can deliver the final blow once I stop him from moving.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.860
However, I know you're strong, 
but your swordsmanship

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.940
is, well, only average.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.740
There's still something missing 
before you achieve perfection as a warrior.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.370
If that's the case, then, 
why are you having a hard time?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.000
Good point.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.920
I'm missing something, too.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.340
I thought perhaps I could learn it from you, 
since you're Thors' child.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.130
Hey, Thorfinn.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:02.720
What do you think?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.600
What does it mean

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.560
to be a true warrior?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.650
Are you asking what love is?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.450
Are you saying that Ragnar didn't love me?

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.950
Yes.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.660
Then let me ask you.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.920
If what Ragnar felt wasn't love,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.210
then who can embody love correctly?

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.420
He's right there.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.300
See?

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:55.480
When he died, he became more beautiful 
than anyone among the living.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.690
He's love itself.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:05.410
He'll never hate others or steal anymore.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.910
He was abandoned there.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:14.660
He's going to give his body with generosity 
to the beasts and the insects.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.170
He lies exposed to the wind and the rain,

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:22.420
but won't speak a single word in complaint.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.130
Death...

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.140
perfects a person.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.360
Hey!

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.190
Do it! Come on!

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.070
Damn!

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.070
So, you don't know?

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.280
Don't worry about it. 
I wasn't expecting you to know anyway.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.370
That was dirty!

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.000
Are you saying that death is the essence of love?

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:06.090
Yes.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.220
Then what is the feeling when parents 
care for their children,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.850
when a husband and wife care for each other, 
and when Ragnar cares about me?

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.310
It's discrimination.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:23.110
It's no different from fawning over a king 
while hitting a slave with a whip.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:30.570
To Ragnar, you were more important 
than anyone else, Your Highness.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.790
Probably even more important than his own life.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.590
His tender feelings towards you were discrimination.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:53.180
I see.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.810
I'm beginning to understand.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.190
I feel like

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.400
the fog has lifted.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.530
What?

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.200
Come on!

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.410
He's done with you!

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.870
Hey...

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.300
Damn... It's still too shallow.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.430
I'm beginning to understand.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.890
This snow...

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.440
is love, right?

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.190
That's right.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.440
The sky.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.150
The sun.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.030
The wind.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.950
The fog.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.240
The mountains.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.380
But then...

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.960
I can't believe it.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.010
The world.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.390
The creation of God is so beautiful. 
But then why...

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.890
is there no love...

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.900
in the hearts of men?

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.740
They say that the reason we turned into 
creatures like this

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.290
is because our ancestors disobeyed God

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.040
and committed a sin long ago.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.340
We were...

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.550
expelled from paradise.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.270
What?

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:07.690
Where did he go?

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.730
Hey. What's that?

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.110
He dampened the shock with his legs. Nice move.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.170
Over there!

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.790
Wow!

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.000
He must be dead now!

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.090
Impressive, captain!

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.130
Damn.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.590
I've lost all hope now.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.790
It looks like the battle is over.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.880
But

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:15.300
this is no good. That man has gone insane.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.050
Your Highness. You had better run away.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.350
Sane?

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.730
Is anyone sane in this world?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.280
Everyone's the same.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.780
Everyone's the same.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.160
No one knows how to love.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.250
No one knows the meaning of life.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.080
No one knows the meaning of death.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.630
No one even knows the reason they're fighting.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.300
Your Highness.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.890
I've had enough. I'm sick of it.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.530
What we lost in exchange for wisdom...

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.910
The most important thing... It's something

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.080
that we'll never get back as long as we live.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.630
We'll never attain it.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.300
Yet, even then...

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.890
You still tell us to seek it?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.640
Father in heaven!

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.900
Miserable warrior.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.990
You're the farthest from love.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.990
You, who have been expelled from paradise.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.340
Isn't there any way to end the suffering 
from your punishment other than death?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.220
Are you saying that we only exist 
so that we may be tested and endure?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.180
Father in heaven!

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.440
This man's soul cannot be saved 
through the trials you set for him!

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.670
Father.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.840
I no longer seek your salvation.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.130
If you will no longer give us salvation,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.010
then, with our own hands,

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.970
on this earth,

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.850
we shall create our own paradise.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.270
What? Prince?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.740
Ow!

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.660
Prince! Are you okay?

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.620
Stop, you fools.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.910
Don't fight futile battles anymore.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.910
Futile?

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.920
Your wounds are deep. Are you okay?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.800
Damn. I slipped up.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.340
Don't move. Your stomach is cut. Willibald!

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.470
Treat his wounds.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.390
I'm going to catch the horses.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.930
You. Help him.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.440
Your Highness, I've seen a miracle.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.320
Be quiet and treat his wounds.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.700
Hey! Prince! Where are you going?

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:12.040
We're going to give you to Thorkell! 
Or else my buddies--

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.500
I was already planning to see Thorkell.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.210
We won't be able to transport the wounded 
unless we borrow their sleds.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.340
What? You're talking nonsense!

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.180
Do you have any idea why I'm in 
such a mess right now? You idiot!

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.300
If you get captured by Thorkell, 
then there will be no meaning to any of this!

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.850
Meaning?

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.560
Did you say meaning?

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.940
The meaning of your battles?

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.320
There is no meaning to a battle like this.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.820
So, don't die.

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.820
Warriors. Become my vassals.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.000
I shall teach you about when you must fight, 
and against whom.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:02.540
I shall give meaning to your battles. 
To your life and death.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:05.960
That's what...

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.340
the duty of a king is.
