WEBVTT

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.430
Sorry!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.150
I missed the vital spot! I'll put you at ease--

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.610
Askeladd...

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.820
I wanted to be friends with you...

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.370
Yeah. Bjorn...

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.700
You...

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.790
You are my only...

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.210
friend.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.010
Send me off...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.040
Well, then, sorry to keep you waiting, kid.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.500
Come.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.090
I'll play with you.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.280
LONE WOLF

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.910
Damn.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.540
He's acting different than usual.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.800
So? Who do you think is going to win, prince?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.710
Want to make a bet?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.760
I don't care who wins.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.840
I'll stop the duel before someone dies.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.760
You're no fun!

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.890
You don't get to see duels 
between such skilled warriors every day.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.860
Well, then, which one do you think is stronger?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.360
Me? Well...

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.080
I guess Askeladd. I bet one pound of silver on him.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.660
I'm not going to make a bet. 
Why do you think so?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.420
Just a feeling. It's his aura.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.630
Thorfinn defeated you.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.670
Is Askeladd even better than that?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.340
You. Prince. Who do you think I am?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.180
There's no way that I'm the weakest one 
out of us three. Right?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.730
It's not that simple to tell who's stronger 
and who's weaker.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.360
Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose. 
It's not easy to rank people. That's the fun part.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.110
I'm not interested.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.910
You must be a woman.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.620
What's wrong, Thorfinn? Come.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.000
I want to finish this before the snow gets worse.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.800
I have no choice.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.390
Look. Now, it's easier to attack me, right?

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.810
Come, boy.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.830
Right?

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.170
You still don't understand why it turns out like this?

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.530
I take back what I said just now. 
This isn't a duel.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.950
Askeladd knows Thorfinn's habits. 
He can see through his cover.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.910
These two must have dueled many times. 
What's the reason for the duel?

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.460
I don't know. No one told me.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.130
Unbelievable.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.260
You never learn, kid.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.340
Did you get full of yourself after you beat Thorkell?

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.270
I'm sick of you.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.440
Stop! That's enough!

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.450
Did you think you could beat me 
with only one arm?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.200
Come on.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.120
Today, I'm feeling damn good.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.290
Stop!

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.260
Stop. He's passed out.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.930
You win.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.520
You're really going to stop them?

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.140
Thorfinn! Hey! Thorfinn!

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.740
Do you understand? The duel is over.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.450
You lost.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.040
Enough. It's over now.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.290
You bastard!

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.790
You passed out.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.540
He already delivered the deathblow.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.300
Start over again once your right arm has healed.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.890
It will end the same way 
even after your arm heals.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.020
It's not because of your wound.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.690
You're an idiot who loses because he's an idiot.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.190
Normally, you know how to think while you fight.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.320
But once you lose your temper, 
it all goes to waste.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:59.620
I can tell from where you're looking 
that you're going after my neck.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.790
Losing your temper, shouting loudly,

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.130
and waving your sword around 
is how an idiot fights.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.800
Unbelievable. Everyone's the same.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.130
There's no beauty in it.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.430
Bjorn is right.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.020
I hate warriors.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.060
Especially Norse warriors, Vikings.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.740
The first man I ever killed was also a Norse warrior.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.360
He was not a beautiful man.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.660
He was my father.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.250
Kid...

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.920
I'm going to tell you something for future reference.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.300
I'm going to tell you how to kill someone you hate.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.360
All right!

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.900
-I'm getting old. 
-Watch out behind you.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:20.990
My mother was a slave.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.500
My mother was sick and couldn't work.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.840
So, ever since I was old enough to remember,

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.460
I was working in the blacksmith's shop and the stable.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.430
My body was always covered in

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:46.020
ash, coal, or horse manure, 
and was always white or black.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.100
They gave me the nickname "Askeladd."

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.190
It means "covered in ash."

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.690
Olaf has returned!

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.700
He was victorious again!

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.710
My father was from a powerful family in Jutland.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.290
-Olaf! 
-Welcome back, Olaf!

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.710
He loved booze, women and killing people.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.220
He was a Viking, 
just like those you'd find anywhere else.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.050
I heard he had lots of kids like me 
with random women here and there.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.850
But he only named the older kids 
he had with his legal wife.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.480
He probably didn't even know 
what his other kids looked like.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.490
I heard that my mother

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.870
was one of my father's favorite slaves 
when she was younger.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.870
But after she fell ill, he treated her like a dog.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.880
For me, life had always been hard.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.050
But it was different for my mother.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.640
My mother often told me about 
the hero Artorius, one of our ancestors.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.440
She told the same story many times.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.900
The legend was about a general 
who protected my mother's homeland

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.440
from being invaded by savages 500 years ago.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.530
My mother believed the legend's prophecy 
that the hero would be resurrected.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:31.080
She believed that he would return 
to free her from illness and enslavement.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.250
She kept repeating it.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.340
So, I started to believe it, too.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.050
She said that far to the west,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.180
in a land across the sea 
where ordinary people cannot reach,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.350
there lies a paradise where the hero Artorius lives.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.110
A paradise, where peace, 
prosperity and eternal life is promised.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.040
The hero is still there now, healing his battle wounds.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:18.670
Someday, he will come 
leading an army to slay the savages

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.000
and conquer the world.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.130
My mother's family kept waiting for him.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.770
They waited for 500 years.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.150
The hero hasn't appeared yet.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.740
But just think about it.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.490
If our ancestor really was living in such a nice place,

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.740
he'd never choose to come back to a world like this.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.670
When I was 11, my mother's heart finally snapped.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:12.850
Mother!

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.740
Of all the things that could happen, 
she thought that my father, who was just passing by,

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.660
was the hero Artorius.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.090
I realized in an instant.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.470
If Artorius wasn't going to 
come save my mother in that moment,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.430
then he's never going to come.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.730
Do you understand, kids?

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.230
Someone must do it.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.030
A person, not a hero, and not a god.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.340
It's weird.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.880
I had never used a sword before 
but it felt right in my hands.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.220
I knew how to swing it.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.680
I thought of it as proof that I had the blood of 
that damn bastard flowing through my veins.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.730
I'm so ashamed.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.850
It makes me want to cry.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.120
You.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.410
Are you her child?

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.670
Are you my child?

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.210
Yes.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.480
You have potential.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.350
You live in the hall starting today.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.530
I knew he wasn't someone who an 11-year-old could kill.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.200
But I succeeded in getting my father to notice me.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.040
I behaved myself in the hall.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.580
I didn't slack off in my training 
for the military arts or horsemanship.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.960
I even got along well with my half-brothers.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.260
Good job, Askeladd.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.480
I always made sure I showed respect to my father.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.750
I was a loyal son and didn't forget 
that he saved me from my life as a slave.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:28.960
Before long, everyone 
started to accept me as my father's son.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.050
I worked on it for two years.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.030
I was after two things.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.910
I wanted to catch him with his guard down, 
and I wanted the right to inherit his property.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.410
I wish you could have seen it.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.290
His face had this look, like he was asking, "Why?"

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.510
I used my brother's sword.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.840
I chose someone who didn't 
get along with my father and stole his sword.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.680
My other brothers thought 
he was the one who did it and hanged him.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.100
They're so simple-minded.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.110
They're stupid and filthy.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.690
The have nothing except for their own greed.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:43.950
People without beauty like them 
started popping up everywhere

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.290
and throwing their weight around.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.670
There's no end to it, no matter how many I kill.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:55.130
I don't care whether it's Artorius, Ragnarok, 
or the Last Judgment.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.510
If you're really going to come, 
then you'd better hurry.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:06.140
Well, when that happens, I bet they're not going to 
let me keep on living either though.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.820
Well, that was a long story. Anyway, Thorfinn...

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:19.110
you still can't even kill me 
even though it's been 10 years.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.240
That means you're an idiot.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.160
Shut up!

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.290
I'm...

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.790
I'm going to kill you, no matter what happens!

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.590
I'm going to kill you, no matter what!

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.260
Come on.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.890
You're still saying that? Right after what I told you?

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.140
You're just like a dog chasing after food.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.360
I really am thankful for all your hard work.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.110
All I have to do is put on an act 
having these duels with you.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.910
And then you'd go run off 
and even fight someone like Thorkell.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.490
You're a useful kid.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960
Unbelievable.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.670
I must thank Thors, too.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.560
Wait.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.640
Wait!

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.980
Stop.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:37.650
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Be quiet!

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.320
Now is the time to heal your wounds.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.950
I said wait.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.370
Won't you stop?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.580
How pathetic.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.970
Oh, dear. You're stiff now, Bjorn.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:15.690
Why me?

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.690
You're the hero's descendant, Askeladd.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.900
And you're quick-witted.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.620
Don't you want to become the king yourself 
and change the world?

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:34.750
You're joking, right?

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.870
Weren't you listening just now?

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.720
You're more suited to be the king.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.880
More than me or King Sweyn.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.390
I can tell by looking at your face.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.060
I'm just a Viking.
