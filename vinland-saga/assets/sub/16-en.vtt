WEBVTT

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.050
He put up a valiant fight

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.510
against a group of English soldiers.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.300
But he was stabbed from behind with a spear, 
and tragically...

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.140
Please accept my sincere condolences, 
Your Highness.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.480
We were eating rabbit stew,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.530
and then he left suddenly.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.120
That's weird.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.450
Just now...

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.580
But...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.750
We shall leave immediately.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.830
Get ready.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.420
Thorfinn.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.380
Don't leave him alone.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
What? You're kidding me! I don't want to!

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.090
Hey! Wait!

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.970
Guarding the prince is your job!

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.260
No!

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.740
He's paralyzed with fear.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.450
Is that weakling of a prince going to be okay?

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.240
I think your plan backfired, Askeladd.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.990
Maybe you shouldn't have killed Ragnar.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.410
HISTORY OF BEASTS

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.120
Don't talk so loudly.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
Most of the men don't know what really happened.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.420
The English are the ones who did it.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.630
Don't let the secret out.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.880
I wonder...

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.010
Everyone knows you didn't get along with Ragnar.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.510
He may be weak, but he's going to realize 
what happened.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.390
As long as there's no proof, it will be fine.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.100
The reason the prince is so weak

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.390
is because Ragnar spoiled him.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.560
I had to make Ragnar disappear.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.270
Otherwise, he'd cause me grief.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.530
The fact that he's weak is a good thing.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.150
It makes him easy to control.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.530
He can be used as the perfect stepping stone 
to achieve greatness in the world.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:08.700
Bjorn.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.830
Why have you served me for all this time?

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.880
Well, it's...

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.960
because I wanted to.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.840
I'm the same.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.300
I choose my own lord too.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.590
My lord

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.850
must be the type of man that makes me want 
to serve him.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.600
Just kidding.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.650
I'm making a gamble, Bjorn.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.190
If we get lucky,

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.400
that prince might completely change.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.570
What are you going to do if you don't get lucky?

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.330
He might 
get depressed and never recover.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.040
If that happens, I'll abandon him.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.910
He wouldn't deserve to be my lord.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.930
How's it going? Is he going to crack?

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.470
He pisses me off.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.430
He won't even scream.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.020
He thinks he's a martyr.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.140
This is why I hate Christians.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.060
You didn't kick him hard enough.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.730
I'll show you how to do it.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.610
This is how you kick!

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.030
Like this!

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.240
Good job.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.780
You're bad at kicking too.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.040
Kick him in the jaw.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.080
Wait! It's my turn next!

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.120
Stop!

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.580
Come on!

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.170
Don't overdo it, you guys!

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.130
If you kill him, we can't get him to talk!

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.010
Go ahead and kill me.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.260
The Lord sees everything.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.060
He's seen all the evil things you Danes have done.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.930
He still has some fight left in him.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.100
Do you have any shears?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.610
Go find them.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.270
What?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.690
Shears, right?

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.150
Well, then.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.620
I'll say it again, English captain.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.450
There are three things I want to know.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.410
How many reinforcements do they have?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.420
And how long until they get here?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.920
Lastly, how did they find out we're here?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.460
If you tell me, I'll let you live.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.220
You beasts!

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.850
You bastards.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.810
You shall be punished.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.430
A death befitting of you bastards

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.390
awaits you...

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.940
Hey. Will these shears work?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:46.740
Yeah.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.490
Captain.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.330
Your fingernails are long.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.500
Long fingernails are dirty.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.290
You should cut them.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.670
Oh, sorry!

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.130
I cut too deep.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.380
Hold him down.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.720
There are three things I want to know.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.430
I'll skip the rest.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.600
Oh, I cut too deep again!

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.690
I did it twice!

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.110
That's so nasty.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.360
What's he holding out for?

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.280
Go to hell, you Danes!

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.410
You bastards!

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.620
If you bastards hadn't come...

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.750
You bastards burned down my village!

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.790
You tortured my wife and daughter and killed them!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.170
You beasts!

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.130
This is our land! Leave!

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.180
I see.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.390
We're beasts?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.760
You guys are ignorant.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.100
Let me teach you some history.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.350
You should thank me for sharing this,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440
you Saxon.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.860
Or is it the Anglos who live in this area?

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.400
Well, they're the same thing.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.240
This land

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.570
didn't belong to you originally.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.620
The first inhabitants were the Celts.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.790
They lived in the forests and worshiped the spirits.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.460
They were the ancestors of the people 
who live in Wales now.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.880
Then one day, the Romans came.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.920
They were the rulers,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.220
but they lived on this land alongside the Celts

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.260
and gave them their knowledge, technology and culture.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.180
The Romans left,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.190
and then you Anglos and Saxons arrived.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.270
It happened 500 years ago.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.440
You didn't give anything to the Celts.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.780
Instead,

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.530
you drove out the Celts from these fertile plains

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.280
and forced them to live in the wastelands.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.410
You're lying!

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.580
I'm not lying.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.830
If the Danes are beasts,

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.670
then you Anglo-Saxons are beasts too.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.590
You stole these lands using violence.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.930
We Danes are going to steal these lands 
from you using even greater violence.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.890
You have no objections to that, right?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.600
Shut up!

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.560
I don't believe you, you savages!

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.150
Teachers hate kids that don't listen.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.490
What?

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.070
Captain.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.320
Now that I've got a good look at your face...

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.240
Your nose is long.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.790
Askeladd!

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.760
How many are there, Ear?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.970
I'm not sure. But there's a lot.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.590
They're coming from the south!

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.100
Enemy reinforcements?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.890
In the middle of the night?

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.440
The English are attacking at night? Impressive.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.020
They're here!

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.400
It's too late! You bastards are going to die!

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:18.280
I can't wait to see you Danes eat each other alive!

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.620
-Danes? 
-I'll tell you what's happening.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.780
Thorkell's coming!

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.700
Not a bad match, right?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.330
It's Thorkell!

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.120
Did he say Thorkell? What are we going to do?

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.960
Hey.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.540
Did he say Thorkell?

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.300
Who knows? I thought that's what he said.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.800
If it's true, we're in trouble.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.800
Thorkell?

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.300
Did you say Thorkell?

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.310
No way!

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.850
Really?

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.520
Thorkell's coming!

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.610
Is that the village?

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.490
That's what it looks like.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.450
All right! We're going to surround them!

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.030
Vali and Ingolf's units, take the left!

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.660
Oddr, take the right!

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.580
I'm going to take the middle.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.000
Kill anyone you see!

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.040
But don't kill the prince.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.000
And there should be a kid with a knife.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.470
Don't kill him either.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.890
He's my playmate.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.430
Thorkell's coming!

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.020
Let me go, you buffoon!

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.980
Are you going to disobey my orders?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.480
I can't leave Ragnar behind!

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.940
I'm not going without Ragnar!

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.530
Forget about it, Your Highness.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.830
We only have three sleds. 
We don't have room for a corpse.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.910
Then let's hold a funeral for him.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.830
Pay your respects to the death of a warrior! 
This is an order!

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.670
We don't have enough time for that either.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.960
You bastard!

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.470
No! I'm not going!

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.970
Ragnar! Ragnar--

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.230
Ragnar is dead. He won't come even if you call for him.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.030
You bastard...

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:30.450
Askeladd!

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.210
They're deserters. They were planning to join Thorkell.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.630
They were hiding in the straw.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.430
Ragnar was right!

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.850
Luck's not on your side right now.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.730
We're not the only ones.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.940
Everyone knows we're in trouble.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.860
We're in big trouble this time. You're...

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.990
Thorkell has you by the tail.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.330
Go ahead.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.630
Listen, men. Follow whichever leader you want.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.800
If you're going to leave, then leave! 
I won't blame you.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.920
If you're going to come with me,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.130
then march!

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.640
We're going to march until we lose Thorkell!

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.310
Walk while you eat, and walk while you sleep!

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:37.690
Listen, men!

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.110
If you can't keep up, then you're dead.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.470
Wait, Thorkell!

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.480
We're not like Askeladd.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.980
We want to join you--

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.700
So, your leader's name is Askeladd?

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.870
Oh, what a nice sword.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.290
-It's mine now! 
-Oh, nice.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.340
The fact that some of their men deserted

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.970
means they must be really worried.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.880
Poor things.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.340
You should've just let them join us.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.310
It's okay. They're worthless.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.640
I don't need cowards who surrender 
without putting up a fight.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.650
Men, to the east! We're going to chase down the prince!

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.820
Give it everything you got!

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.700
Yeah!

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.410
The right! You're too far to the right!

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.080
Move it back.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.670
No! I meant my right.

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.000
JANUARY 1014 AD 
UPPER SEVERN RIVER, EARLDOM OF MERCIA

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.630
-That's right. Keep going. Go slow. 
-Heave ho!

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.800
Hurry up!

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.550
You're holding us up back here!

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.520
Torgrim. Atli. Come with me.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.730
-Okay. 
-Okay.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.940
Destroy this bridge. You guys take the lead.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.900
-Hurry. 
-Okay.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.360
We're going to take the bridge apart.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.570
Pitch in if you have an ax!

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.070
I'm so tired.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.450
Is Thorkell nearby, Ear?

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.450
They're being too loud. I'm not sure.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.040
We might have enough time to destroy the bridge.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.470
Hey! Hold on! You, there, priest!

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.010
What are you doing?

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.140
Do you have any booze?

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.980
Even if I did, I wouldn't give you any.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.400
We don't even have enough for ourselves.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.400
I don't have any booze for you.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.980
Can't you tell we're in a tight spot right now, priest?

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.420
The water's really cold.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.460
Hey! This river's pretty shallow.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.590
They'll be able to cross it on foot!

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.510
What's the point of destroying the bridge?

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.140
But we can't just leave it here.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.440
Maybe it'll piss them off at least.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.730
Looks like Askeladd ran out 
of those bright ideas of his.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.120
Bjorn! Thorfinn!

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.170
-What's wrong? 
-Come over here.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.170
What's going on?

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.640
Bjorn. Move the prince over to this carriage here.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.470
You be the driver.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.060
Thorfinn, you ride with the prince. Be on standby.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.640
What?

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.060
Hey!

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.980
Askeladd!

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.820
Are you serious?

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.820
It's my special talent.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.070
I can tell what a man is like

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.580
just by looking at his face.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.120
Whether he's an important man, or a nobody. 
Smart, or dumb.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.500
I can tell that 
there are some traitors among the loyal.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.590
What?

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:16.630
Take the prince? Are you crazy?

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.590
Idiot! Don't say it so loudly!

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.390
Atli.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:23.060
This army is done for already.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.770
Let's join Thorkell's army 
and give him the prince as a gift.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.850
More than half of the other men are already on our side.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.020
We'll be able to convince the other half easily.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.940
You're going to betray him?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.360
Betray Askeladd?

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.540
Don't call it a betrayal, Atli.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.370
He's a good leader. He's done a good job.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.540
That's why we're going to make him 
take responsibility as the leader.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.710
We'll be fine! We'll be able to escape!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.960
We've always been able to escape, right?

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.090
Well, up until now.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.340
But what about recently?

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.180
He's made the wrong call, one after the other.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.010
He's run out of luck.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.890
And Thorkell found us, 
even though we thought he was beat.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.060
Don't look at me like that.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.570
Well, you're right. He's a good leader.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.990
Then why did he mess with Thorkell?

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.410
Brother...

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.200
I'm not happy about this either.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.870
But we can't help it.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.870
Askeladd made a bet, and he lost.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.960
That's all.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.890
Good job.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.140
They're going to have a hard time getting their 
sleds and cargo across.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.480
What if they abandon their cargo and keep chasing us?

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.320
Then they're going to lose time finding food.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.940
They won't be able to follow us very far without eating.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.700
All right! Resume the march!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.830
They're here!

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.380
Oh, I saw a flash!

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.320
I...

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.070
found you!

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.630
-Unbelievable! 
-No way...

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.460
-A spear? 
-Three of them? That's impossible!

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.880
No! There were four of them!

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.720
-This is bad. 
-Damn! This is bad!

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.300
-This is really bad! 
-All right!

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.680
Calm down, men!

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.350
He's still far away.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.930
And we destroyed the bridge. 
Forget about that spear just now.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.640
Bridge?

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.480
What about the bridge?

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.520
They'll be able to cross that river on foot!

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.530
Destroying the bridge was useless!

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.110
Is that what you think?

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.700
If that's what you think, 
then we're leaving right now.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.870
Every minute is precious.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.410
Not again!

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.830
You keep saying march, march, march!

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:35.920
Don't you know any other words?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.420
You!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.800
We can't win against Thorkell.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.090
Just bear with it for one more day.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.430
Destroying the bridge will start to pay off then.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.810
They can only march as fast as they can 
carry their cargo.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.060
They're going to have trouble getting their cargo across.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.060
If they leave their cargo behind to chase us, 
they won't be able to replenish supplies.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.150
They'll only be able to march for one day like that.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.820
Understand, men?

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.450
If you understand, start marching!

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.070
There's no guarantee we'll be able 
to survive one more day!

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.880
Oh, really? Then this is where we say goodbye.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.050
I'm in a hurry. Excuse me.
