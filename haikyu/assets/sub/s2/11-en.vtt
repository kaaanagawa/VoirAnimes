00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.740
Akaashi...

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.000
Don't set for me anymore today!

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.780
Okay.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.870
Huh?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.940
But in exchange, please calm down.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
I don't know what's going on,
 but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well!

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.590
Let's keep it up!

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.600
Yeah!

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.600


00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.540
I keep running as I run out of breath

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.450
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.450

If I come to a standstill

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.220
People ask me why I find joy in this

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.800
But I don't understand it myself

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.690
Running is the only thing on my mind

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.860
Even if nothing goes right in the future

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.490
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.790
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.870
And draws the line on me

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.810
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.300
So what?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.920
Whatever the future may bring

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.630
So what?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.420
However people are supposed to act

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.160
So what?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.860
It doesn't really matter

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.790
So I'm a believer

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.570
So I'm a believer

Nice spike!

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.370
Yeah!

Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.130
M-Maybe I'm just imagining it, 
but it doesn't seem like Fukurodani is fazed at all.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.220
Yeah...

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.330
Here's a chance!

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.640
Here.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.350
<i>Right now, there are two attackers up front for Fukurodani.</i>

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.520
<i>Will they do a fast attack from the middle,</i>

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.770
<i>a back row attack,</i>

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.070
<i>or will number four finally come back?</i>

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.240
A setter dump!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.370
Fukurodani's back in the lead!

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.200
Karasuno                   Fukurodani

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.200
Karasuno                   Fukurodani

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.200
And the ace hasn't even scored once!

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.420
Bokuto may look like the eldest son of the family, 
but he's actually the youngest.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.420 line:20%
Nice, Akaashi!

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.920 line:20%
Thank you.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.880
Though he <i>is</i> the strongest individually.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.420 line:20%
Nice receive!

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.510
<i>We're used to Bokuto's slumps.</i>

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.760
<i>The smallest thing can make him happy or depressed.</i>

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.760 line:20%
Left!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.010
<i>What are we gonna do with him?</i>

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.310
All right!

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.850
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.850

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.100
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.180
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.180
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.470
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.470
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.980
Fukurodani's on match point!

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.560
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.560
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.980
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.980
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.270
Just one more point!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.400
I guess Fukurodani isn't a team that Bokuto leads, but one where the team leads the way for him.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.450
I touched it!

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.580
<i>I understand now that Fukurodani isn't a one-man team of Bokuto.</i>

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.290
<i>That said...</i>

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.920
<i>He's definitely the scariest person on their team.</i>

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.790
Totally shut out!

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.130
All right! Just one more point for a deuce!

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.590
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.590
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.340
Wow...

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.840
Well done.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.060
<i>If I mess up the serve here, the match will instantly end.</i>

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.140
<i>I'll...</i>

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.230
<i>definitely make this one land!</i>

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.440
Komi!

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.150
Yeah!

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.440
Nice receive!

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.150
<i>I'm sure Karasuno's figured out 
what kind of team we are by now.</i>

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.610
<i>Which means their attention is off of the ace.</i>

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.200
<i>And he wants to spike so bad that he's getting fidgety!</i>

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.210
<i>We'll let you have the spotlight.</i>

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.790
<i>So...</i>

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.880
<i>pick yourself back up...</i>

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.190
<i>ace!</i>

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.890
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.890
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.020
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.020
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.140
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.230
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.230
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.520
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.520
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.600
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.600
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.230
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.230
Karasuno                     Fukurodani

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.740
<i>Please.</i>

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.700
<i>Leave it to us.</i>

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.830
Nice job, ace!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.210
That was awesome!

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.830
In the end, it just <i>has</i> to be the ace!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.810
Oh no! It's a raptor!

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.590
Your hair's like a great horned owl!

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.510
I'm truly the best!

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.520
Hey, hey, hey!

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.480
Hey, hey, hey...

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.020
He's able to pick himself back up so quickly.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.440
So that's what you call simple-minded.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.530
<i>The weakness of their ace draws out the strengths of the other members.</i>

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.780
<i>And at the same time, it becomes
 the root that holds the team together.</i>

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.990
<i>I guess that's another form of strength.</i>

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.750
To be honest, I was thinking we might be okay if we 
were able to stop Bokuto, but I guess that was naïve.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.630
I bet he's allowed the freedom to do 
whatever he wants without them caring

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.430 line:20%
Aren't I awesome, Akaashi?!

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.180
because they have complete faith in one another.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.590 line:20%
For sure, Bokuto.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.510
Our team just isn't at the point where any of them can be that selfish yet.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.270
I'm sorry!

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.520
That last serve was a total meatball because I chickened out!

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.110
If you can realize that all by yourself, you're doing just fine.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.740
What determines whether you can win or not is 
how aggressive you can be in situations like that.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.580
Nobody wants to end a match
 because of a mistake they made.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.790
He's talking about you.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.210
Shut up!

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.670
But nobody will blame you for trying to hit a serve to take the win, either.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.760
Yes, sir!

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.260
Anyway, that was one hell of a losing streak we went on.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.470
Though one thing is for certain.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.020
Your offense will work against the top teams in the country!

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.030
Right now, your serves and combo attacks are no match for our opponent's.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.370
This is no surprise since you guys started practicing them way later.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.870
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.830
Don't think that you've reached your limit.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.380
You know how when you mix colors, they become muddled and dirty?

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.890
But once you finish mixing, you get the
 color which no other can overtake—black.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.310
Please make our team black, a fitting color for crows.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.060
Oops! Was my metaphor too difficult to understand?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.310
No! Thank you very much, sir!

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.900
Thank you very much, sir!

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.490
All right, time for our last penalty of the training camp!

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.360
One lap of diving drills!

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.780
Yessir!

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.390
Asahi!

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.500
There's still a little time left, 
so could you hit some of my sets?

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.000
Sure thing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.040
Noya! Let me hit a few too!

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.980
Sounds good, Ryuu!

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.500
Oh, me too.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.130
You'll throw them up for us, Suga?

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.050
That'll be perfect!

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.510
Um, not exactly.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.640
I'm gonna spike.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.470
Damn it.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.690
If we'd practiced our fast attack just a bit more, 
we might've been able to take a set off of Fukurodani.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.940
But we have a way to fight them now.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.360
Even if they can predict our moves or catch up to us...

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.320
we can fight!

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.990
That all depends on my sets.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.040
It's fine. You'll get there eventually.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.290
Don't tell me what I'm gonna do!

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.580
Are you saying you won't?

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.420
Of course I'll get there eventually, moron!

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.840
So I <i>was</i> right!

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.630 line:20%
Let's go practice that fast attack!

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.840
It's a good thing being that stupid isn't contagious.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.840 line:20%
Yeah!

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.970
We head straight into the spring tourney prelims as soon as we get back.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.890
Yeah. The next time we'll come back to Tokyo will be after that.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.190
I hope it won't be as hot then.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.150
Nah, it'll probably still be warm.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.810
What's his problem, Suga?

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.070
If we don't make it through the prelims,
 the three of us won't be able to come back.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:57.590
Oh look, it's Mr. Gloomy Goatee!

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.150
Wh-What...

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.420
Of course we'll be coming back, moron!

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.580
You're right. Sorry.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.580 line:20%
Begone, gloom!

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.370
Actually, you sounded like Kageyama just now.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.540
Moron! Hinata, you moron!

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.130
It's perfect!

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:12.830
Do it again!

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.010
I-It feels like I'm getting an extra scolding somehow...

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.050
What?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.850
Hell yeah! It's meat time!

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.470
I could eat an entire cow!

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.890
Take the plates over to where Miyanoshita is.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:30.190
Sure.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.520
There we go.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.350
So even Bokuto has slumps.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.460
Yeah.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.900
He sometimes self-destructs in bizarre ways.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.950
On the other hand, he doesn't care how good our opponents are, so it works out in the end.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.500
When everyone else on the team loses hope, he's usually still pretty energetic.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.330
Despite everything, he's pretty reliable.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.440
Bokuto!

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.460
W-We're not gonna lose in an actual match!

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.830
Oh yeah?! Bring it on, then!

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.850
Before spring nationals,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.820
we need to have our meat war, Hinata!

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.560
Ahem.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.270
Thank you for all the hard work
 in this week-long training camp!

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.980
Tasty food smiles at the sound of hunger.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.700
Feel free to repair your muscles as much as you wish!

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.370
Thanks for the food!

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.500
So then, Kenma...

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.710
Stop right there!

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.050
Don't steal my food, you bastard!

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.800
Have some rice balls too!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.850
Oh, thank—

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.760
What?!

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.770
Do you understand, Ryuu?

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.940
Of course.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.860
Tora?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.860
Yes, Master.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.070
Do not allow for any dudes to use these 
good spirits as an excuse to approach Kiyoko!

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.570
As you wish!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:10.910
Go!

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.450
You go!

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.010
Why is Nishinoya the master?

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.310
Apparently, it's because he's the only one to have been slapped by Shimizu.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.350
I see...

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.890
Tsukishima!

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.770
You need to eat more!

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.600
There's no way I can eat that much.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.980
C'mon! Eat some veggies too!

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.890
Kenma! You eat some too, damn it!

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.190
Eat some rice!

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.610
You mean meat! Eat some meat, Tsukki!

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.320
You won't grow big otherwise!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.160
Are they, like, some pushy uncles?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.450
And he's the young, defiant nephew who can't stand them.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.700
The generals totally see that and are having fun with it.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.370
Hey, Suga.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.660
One of your managers is acting really strange. Is she okay?

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.480
<i>Th-This is like...</i>

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.760
<i>a jungle of giants!</i>

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.680
<i>The meat smells so good... I wanna eat some...</i>

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.310 line:20%
Is this done already?

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.520
<i>But if I carelessly rush in there, they might eat me by accident!</i>

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.520 line:20%
Hey, I was planning on eating that!

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.150
<i>Or worse, barbecue me!</i>

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.190
Can you reach? Would you like me to get you something?

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.610
I promise I don't taste good!

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.030
Er, I mean, I'm fine! Thanks!

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.550
I was thinking about eating this.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.000
I-It's delicious.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.210
It tastes like real life...

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.040
Yacchan? The one you just ate looked really charred. Are you all right?

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.460
Want some tea?

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.260
There's water too.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.930
Doesn't that look a bit sketchy to you?

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.470
Yeah...

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.180
They'd probably get the cops called on them if this was in the city.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.220
I definitely wouldn't want to be surrounded by them.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.360
I'd much rather have them surround me.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.200
Karasuno's third-years seem like they have their act together.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.290
Our managers are all quite beautiful,

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.750
but with Karasuno joining us,
 I think it has gone up one notch further.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.010
What do you think?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.040
I cannot argue.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.420
Our ace is pretty weak-willed, though.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.960
What? Really?

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.050
He sure <i>looks</i> scary.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.510
That's probably better than having such a simple-minded ace.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.240 line:20%
What?!

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.430 line:20%
You're in the nation's top five?!

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.260 line:20%
That's awesome!

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.180 line:20%
Right? Right?!

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.280
Ushiwaka from your region is in the top three, you know.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.100
Top three?!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.980
Hey! That really hurts, you know?!

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.920
Three? Who are the other two?

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.160
Ushiwaka from the Tohoku region,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.660
Kiryuu from the Kyushu region,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.330
and Sakusa from the Kanto region.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.670
Those are the three best aces in the country this year.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.090
One of those three is in Miyagi of all places.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.890
Hey, Tsukki!

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.590
You practiced a ton against my spikes!

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.890
I won't allow you to be intimidated by Ushiwaka!

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.810
Could you please not call me that?

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.730
Besides, just because they're the best doesn't mean their teams are the top three teams in the country.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.810
Yeah! Exactly!

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.980
Though Sakusa's team, Itachiyama, 
is the odds-on favorite to win spring nationals.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.820
Then...

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.750
...if we beat them, we'll be number one?

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.080
Strong words coming from the
 top two at sucking in the country!

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.120
Hinata must be number one.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.540
Kenma said that my serves and receives were better!

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.620
D'oh!

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:49.750
Coach Nekomata.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.550
Again, thank you very much for inviting us.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.010 line:20%
In the end, you couldn't stop my spikes, Tsukki!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.510
It appears their change happened because we came here.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:02.310
No thanks needed. We got some good motivation too, 
so it was mutually beneficial.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.930 line:20%
Lev, you got a cat out of a tree?

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.730 line:20%
Kenma's arms were too short, so he couldn't reach.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.650
Six months from now, not one team here will be the same team as it is now.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.240
The members will change, forming new teams.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:15.820 line:20%
Man, I'm stuffed.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.660
They haven't yet played a match without any regrets.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.660 line:20%
Oh, so the prelims are later in Tokyo.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.160 line:20%
Well, we have a lot of schools.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.160
Not that I've seen, anyway.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.210
Still, I'd like them to play a match where they have no regrets.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.080
All we can do to achieve that is give our very best.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.340
Right.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.600
I hate being bad.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:42.970
Huh?

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.730
But the fact that there are a lot of people up above me...

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.940
makes me really excited!

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:57.860

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.000
Bring it!

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:42.680
That was a good serve, Yamaguchi!

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.510
It was hard to get!

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.560
Oh, right...

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.480
What are you concentrating so hard on?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.730
Oh, Ukai.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.820
Well, I was thinking that while our first-years are amazing, there are tons of other amazing first-years too.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.490
Yeah.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.390

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.080
I'm home.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.090
Whoa, Kei. You grew even taller.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.700
You totally passed me by a long time ago.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.260
Big Bro.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.340
Hey. Long time no see.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.770
It's really been a while since we've gotten to talk.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.810
Has it?

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.450
Even when I come home, 
you usually never leave your room other than to eat.

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.730
Is that so?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.540
You look a bit different.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.700
You went to that training camp, right? Was it rough?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.480
It was fine.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.510
You've got "rough" written all over your face!

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.420
You still play volleyball, right?

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.870
Yeah, I'm on a team.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.290
Do you enter tournaments?

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.590
Yeah, we do.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.590
You want to know why I'm still playing after what happened in high school, am I right?

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.520
I'm still playing...

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.980
<i>because</i> of what happened in high school.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.440
I still really regret it when I think about it.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.730
I can't take anything good from the experience at all.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.740
What you saw was such a disgrace.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.990
I didn't do anything in high school.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.790
I didn't get to experience the
 enjoyable parts of volleyball at all.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.040
But I've already experienced them.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.380
I know how good it feels to land a spike,

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.840
and how proud the roar of the crowd makes me.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.130
<i>That one moment existing is the difference.</i>

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.680
I want to be somewhere I can give it my very best until I'm completely satisfied.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.520
Right...

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.960
I see.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.110
Ukai

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.070
You guys have a tournament starting tomorrow, don't you?

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.540
You should wrap it up soon!

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.730
One more! Just one more!

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.500
We'll finish after this one!

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.870 line:20%
Please!

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.420
You know, this is the first time I've seen the tall boy.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.420 line:20%
Just one more.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.420 line:20%
Thanks!

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.380
He said he didn't get enough practice today
 and begged to use our courts until we started.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.460 line:20%
All right, Hinata! We're going to nail this!

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.300 line:20%
Yeah!

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.920 line:20%
Let's do this, Kageyama!

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.300 line:20%
I know!

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.260
It seems he's the setter from Shou's school.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.390
Is that so?

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.730
Here we go!

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.600
I've been watching for a while, but they keep messing up.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.740
Whoa! Aone, have you gotten even taller?!

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.500
What's this? Dropping by again, Kamasaki?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.300
Nothing better to do?

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.540
Having trouble finding a job?

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.140
Aren't your sleeves rolled up too far?

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.180
Futakuchi, you punk! You should be more appreciative of your—

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.170
Hey, Kunimi.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.880
Was that story Oikawa told for real?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.130
Seemed real to me.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.720
I mean, he does pretty reckless things.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.640
What? Torino?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.170
It's Karasuno.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.480
Where's that? Never heard of it.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.690
If we can defeat Shiratorizawa, 
no one else in the prefecture stands a chance.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.160
Simple as that.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.290
Better too big than too small

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.290
Better too big than too small

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:34.160
We climb the mountain in our way

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:40.730
Losing more than just time in the process

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:46.740
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:52.800
And notice the feelings welling up inside

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.200
It's almost in our reach

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.290
The closer we get, the more it shines

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.080
And stretches out in front of our eyes

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.450
That panorama created just for us

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:11.710
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:17.970
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.830
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:30.990
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.990
That special moment

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.970

<i>Sometimes just having a super-tall guy can be the difference between victory and defeat!</i>

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.580
<i>I'm not tall enough that you need to add "super."</i>

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.880
