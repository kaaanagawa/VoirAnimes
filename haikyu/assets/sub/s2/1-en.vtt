00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.510
<i>The view from the summit—</i>

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.220
<i>it's something I'll never be able to see alone.</i>

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.790
<i>But...</i>

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.590
<i>if I'm not alone...</i>

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.770
<i>I just might be able to see it.</i>

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.320


00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.300
I keep running as I run out of breath

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.210

But I don't understand it myself

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.450

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.630
And draws the line on me

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.570
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.060
So what?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.680
Whatever the future may bring

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.550

Yeah!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.310

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.360

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.730

Rolling... Thunder!

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.530

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.280

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.440
Huh?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.610
Please!

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.120
Guys, playing until you drop isn't the answer.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.740
Captain, you need to tell these guys—

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.180
Sure.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.100
You guys are still gonna practice?

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.060 line:20%
Hey! We've still got to clean up, so that's enough for today!

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.310

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.980 line:20%
Hey, make sure you cool down properly.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.020

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.770
Ow!

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.900

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.950
Take?

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.240
You okay?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.350

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.420
Where?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.910
Your nose is bleeding!

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.120

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.500

Gross!

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.900
Here! A tissue!

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.640
A practice match?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.810
Yeah!

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.730
But we won't be playing just Nekoma this time.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.860
The Fukurodani Academy Group.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.600
It's a group of schools from the 
Kanto region that includes Nekoma.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.330
Apparently, they hold practice matches regularly.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:56.790
Thanks to Coach Nekomata, 
we'll be able to take part this time.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.630
Groups like that are created through relationships built up over years,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.450
so it's not easy to get in without connections.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.720
We'll have to make sure to thank Coach Nekomata.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.850
And Mr. Takeda here,
 who I'm sure kept persistently asking him.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.020
No, I didn't really...

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.060
Coach Ukai's name helped a lot.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.190
Thank you!

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.780
Over the years, we've lost connections with other schools in the prefecture that we used to be friendly with.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.210
There are many schools where the coaches that were once close to Coach Ukai are now gone.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.330
We shouldn't pass up this opportunity.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.790
Yeah!

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.180
I'm going to be able to see that setup up-close again.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.260
Maybe I caught a cold.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.310
I'm getting chills.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.640
Hey! We have a tournament soon!

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.100
This time, I'm gonna protect us 'til we win!

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.820
Yeah... It might actually be a little cold today.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.110
You too, Yaku?!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.440
We're gonna take down that City Boy Alliance!

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.910
City Boy...

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.870
...Alliance?

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:17.330
I'm feeling hot! I'm burning up!

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.330 line:20%
Yamamoto, shut it.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.670
I'm gonna break through their blocks this time for sure!

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.470
Um, the only thing is, their prelims for the interhigh start this weekend, so it won't be right away.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.680
Also, at this point, we've only received the invitation.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.110
There are some things we have to work out, but I'll give you the details another time.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.320
Anyway, it seems like you all...

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.150
Of course!

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:49.900

Oikawa's featured in <i>Monthly Volleyball</i>, 
and it even has his picture.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.070
Well, he <i>is</i> one of the best in the country.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.290
So, what does it say?

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:18.410
Let's see here...

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.700
"Oikawa's favorite food is milk bread.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.420
His favorite saying is, 'If you're going to hit it, hit it until it breaks.'"

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.700
What the hell is that?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.050
Why would anyone care about such pointless information?!

Third-years Remain to 
Take Down Shiratorizawa

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.600
Looks like Seijou wants to take down Shiratorizawa,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.010
so most of the third-years who were starters are staying on the team!

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.890
Come on and bring it, Seijou!

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.190
Bring it!

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.100

Simply put, he's representing Japan in the under 19 age group.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.680
Hey. Don't get lost.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.430
I won't!

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.490
We've lost sight of Ushijima!

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.760
Then we're lost!

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.900
This looks like it might be the volleyball team's gym.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.860
Yeah.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.250
Hey, can you see Ushiwaka?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.960
Shut up! And stop pushing me!

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:44.420
Huh?

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.850
Isn't that another school?

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.130
Is it a practice match? Who're they playing?

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.830
Aren't those college students?

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.900
College?!

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.770
Well, no other high school in the prefecture stands a chance against Shiratorizawa.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.260
They'd have to go outside the prefecture or have a 
college team come in for it to even count as practice.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.810
Curse you, Japan!

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.320
Took you long enough.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.770
I'm Kageyama from Karasuno High School.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.400
Would you mind if I had a look?

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.030
Kageyama...

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.120
From Kitagawa First, right?

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.210
Yes.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.840
I applied to this school but wasn't accepted.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.900
That's not surprising.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.380
I remember seeing one of your junior high matches.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.800
We have no need for setters who can't devote themselves to their aces.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.300
It's true. You're not the type that'd be devoting!

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:34.970
What?!

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.580
But the same would go for the Great King too, wouldn't it?

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.640
And he's the best setter in the prefecture.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.190
Oikawa has nothing to do with this!

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.710
Oikawa...

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.730
He is an efficient player.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.650
He should have come to our school.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.610
By that, do you mean Oikawa would be able to devote himself to you?

00:17:55.370 --> 00:18:00.960
No matter where he is, Oikawa is a setter that can bring out the absolute best in his team.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.100
If the team's absolute best is still bad, there is nothing more to be done.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.290
If it is good, he will make it as good as possible.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.970
That is where his abilities lie.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.400
A sapling must have good soil in order to grow strong.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.010
Good fruit cannot be harvested from barren soil.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.400
Barren soil?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.730
What do you mean?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.280
Other than Oikawa, everyone at Aoba Jousai is bad.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.010
Bad...

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.450
If Seijou is barren soil,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.190
does that make us concrete or something?

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.700
<i>He usually gets intimidated by tough-looking 
opponents when he first meets them, and yet...</i>

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.180
I apologize if I hit a nerve,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.830
but someone on a team that cannot even make it to
 the prefecture finals because they lost to Aoba Jousai

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.400
can say all they want, but I will make nothing of it.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.410
<i>He...</i>

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.000
I'm Hinata Shouyou, from the concrete.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.480
I'm gonna crush you

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.680
and go to nationals.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.500
Hey, are you from another school?

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.790
You're not allowed to be here.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.430
Thank you for showing us around.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.580
Excuse us.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.280
Um...

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.260
If Oikawa's the best setter in the prefecture,

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.620
then I'll be the one to surpass him for that title.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.070
Excuse us.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:42.660
<i>Stamina, speed, agility, jumping, the will to fight...</i>

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.900
<i>Hinata Shouyou.</i>

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.090
<i>Kageyama Tobio.</i>

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.970
Well, in reality,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.680
it's true that we can't beat Seijou, who can't beat Shiratorizawa.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.270
It doesn't matter if we can defeat them both.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.190
Glad to see we're on the same page.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.870
That's why we're going to Tokyo.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.690
To get better, it's best if we play a lot against strong teams, right?

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.960
Let's see here...

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.540
Ahem.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.000
About that trip to Tokyo...

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.250
For now, we're planning to have it next month.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.760
For trips like this, we'll need 
permission from your guardians.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.000
I'll pass out the paperwork later.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.630
As for consent from the school, it's basically all good.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.760
However,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.930
as I'm sure you are aware,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.010
you have final exams starting next month.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.450
You <i>are</i> aware, right?

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:03.030
So, and I think you know what I'm getting at,

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.780
if you fail any subjects,

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.130
supplementary classes will be held that weekend.

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.030
Which means you won't be able to go on the trip.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:15.420


00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:33.960
We climb the mountain in our way

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.530
Losing more than just time in the process

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:46.540
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.600
And notice the feelings welling up inside

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.000
It's almost in our reach

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.090
The closer we get, the more it shines

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.880
And stretches out in front of our eyes

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.250
That panorama created just for us

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:11.510
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:17.770
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:23.630
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:30.780
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.790
That special moment

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.770
Come to us climbers

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.510
Come to us right now

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.470


00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.840
<i>What happens if we skip our final exams?</i>

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.510
<i>You retake them.</i>

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.700
<i>What happens if you skip those?</i>

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:50.580
<i>Retake the retakes?</i>

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.640
<i>I know! We'll just take the tests after the away games!</i>

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.770
<i>If you fake being sick, you can't go on the trip either.</i>

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.440 line:20%
You have my condolences.

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.480
