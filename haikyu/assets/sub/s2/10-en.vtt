WEBVTT

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:09.510
Man, it's crazy how we played more than 60 sets and only won three.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.280 line:20%
Manabu! Come on, drink up.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.280
We've walked quite a difficult road.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.900 line:20%
No, thanks. If I drink any more, I'll definitely feel it tomorrow.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.900
That's for sure.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.990 line:20%
It won't affect us!

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.870
Though if they played like they did in the Seijou match, 
we could've won a few more sets.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.100 line:20%
Manabu, are you saying you're too good for my sake?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.370
The team's offense was focused around Hinata and Kageyama's deviant fast attack and their bait routine,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.840 line:20%
No, um...

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.910 line:20%
I'm just kidding!

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.340
and they executed it well.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.800
But the limits of that strategy were in sight.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.800
And they hit that limit when they lost to Seijou.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.550
That's why they started changing things up.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.260
I know.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.980
Right now, they're each making their own gear.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.230
It's still a work in progress, and they stand no 
chance against a powerhouse team from Kanto.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.190
But if those gears all line up...

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.400
Hey! Don't think that you'll win against Nekoma that easily!

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.830
Easily? I would never think that!

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.540
But we'll be eagerly looking for the chance to win!

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.140
You sure talk big now, Takeda.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.170
You too, Ukai!

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.760
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.760
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.150
This is the final set.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.180
We've been losing this entire training camp.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.640
Let's try to rip at least one set away from the most powerful team at this training camp, Fukurodani,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.390
before going home!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.870
Yeah!

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.410
<i>I'll show you the results of this training camp!</i>

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.440


00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.430
I keep running as I run out of breath

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.340
With dreams on my mind and a fire in my belly

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.940
If I come to a standstill

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.110
People ask me why I find joy in this

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.690
But I don't understand it myself

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.570
Running is the only thing on my mind

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.750
Even if nothing goes right in the future

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.370
I won't stop trying to find the best version of myself

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.680
Even if someone tells me that this is as far as I go

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.760
And draws the line on me

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.700
I'll say no, thank you, and surge on ahead

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.190
So what?

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.800
Whatever the future may bring

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.520
So what?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.310
However people are supposed to act

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.050
So what?

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.750
It doesn't really matter

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.680
So I'm a believer

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.460
So I'm a believer

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.490

Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.790
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.790
Let's have a good match!

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.520
Let's start off strong!

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.510
Yeah!

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.220
All right! Bring it, Karasuno!

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.510
Give us a good serve, Asahi!

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.230
It's a bit off!

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.650
Bokuto!

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.190
Right!

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.610
Left! Number four!

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.440
Tighten up for the straight spike.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.150
It'll get through if there's even the tiniest gap.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.780
It's out!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.700 line:20%
Yes!

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.040
Damn, it went out of bounds.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.910
So close!

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.160 line:20%
Don't worry about it, Tsukishima! You almost had it!

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.370
It really pisses me off how you
 guys keep improving day by day.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.790 line:20%
Right.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.960
Left, left!

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.460
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.460
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.590
Whoa, he got it!

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.590
But it's way off course!

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.430
A fast attack from there?!

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.390
Even if the receive is a little off, 
they confidently pull off a fast attack.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.350
Their setter's pretty skilled too.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.480 line:20%
Give us a good serve.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.690
Stop them here!

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.190
Their number four is up front now.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.770 line:20%
Now I can finally hit up front.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.230
Give us a good one!

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.440
Nishinoya!

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.950
Nice receive!

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.740
Nice, Saru!

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.160
Let me finish it off!

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.950
Our current rotation has the tallest wall of blocks in the front row.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.160
Make sure you stop the ball!

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.340
That's an insane cut shot.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.970
A strong hit that cuts in front of three blockers is very difficult to execute.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.800
It can be hard on your shoulders if they're not flexible.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.220
All right!

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.140
Did you see that, Akaashi?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.190
Hey, did you see my awesome cut shot just now?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.480
I did. It was amazing.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.570
It was pure luck, though!

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.070
Bokuto is so annoying.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.820
That's amazing, even if it was luck.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.110
I'd love to hit a spike like that.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.330
Bokuto from Fukurodani is a truly strange player.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.040 line:20%
Hey, can I try hitting that again?

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.910
Even when he's your opponent, 
you kind of want to cheer for him.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.080 line:20%
I wanna do it again!

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.210 line:20%
The other team's completely on to you, Bokuto.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.670
Though I think that might be because he's on a completely different level.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.960 line:20%
Oh crap! My bad.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.420 line:20%
Maybe I'll go for a straight spike, then.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.080
Yeah...

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.970
He might just be a player who lifts the spirits of both his teammates and his opponents.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.300
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.300
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.930
Yeah!

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.430
Give us a good serve, Tsukishima!

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.180
<i>A special attack?!</i>

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.890
<i>Yep!</i>

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.860
Listen closely. This attack is best described as something born from upsetting the balance of stillness and motion.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.030
Whoa! Whoa...

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.440 line:20%
There he goes, trying to sound all cool again.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.650
Do you have any clue what he's talking about?

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.070
I have an idea.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.740
This attack isn't something you 
use to run away from the enemy.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.870
With perfect timing, a perfect set, a perfect position for spiking...

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.340
Just when everyone thinks a powerful spike is incoming...

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.880
And more than anything, the moment when you think 
you can land a powerful shot is the perfect opportunity!

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.720
I got this!

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.340
Nice receive!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.770
<i>Like you're laughing at them, really go for it!</i>

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.980
Hinata just...

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.440
tipped it over!

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.740
When the tip succeeds, there's a great feeling 
that's totally different than when you land a spike.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.910
You know how a few people will dive for the falling ball?

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:36.990
Yeah.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:44.090
You're usually eye level with them or higher, but when they try to reach for the ball, miss, and then look up...

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.220
<i>It's the best feeling.</i>

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.390
A tip?!

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.600
You're the one who taught it to him.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.730
You actually used your head?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.150
You're gonna get a fever.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.450
You're the only one who doesn't get to say stuff like that to me.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:11.450
Hmph!

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.240
I won't let them score another point!

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.370
I think it's impossible to completely shut them out.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.660
Back me up once in a while, Akaashi!

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.660
Damn you, Shorty!

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.750
We're not gonna lose!

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.340
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.340
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.340
Number two!

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.840
All right!

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.800
Ready, and...

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.220
They all seem to be enjoying themselves.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.970 line:20%
I touched it!

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.930 line:20%
Got it!

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.510
I wonder if Bokuto has something to do with it.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.940
Wow, a setter dump!

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.190
Kageyama is doing well too!

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.980
His jump serves have been on point.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.950
Yeah, he's really calm and collected today.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.280
It's scary like the calm before the storm.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.950
Give us another good serve, Tsukishima!

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.960
<i>I feel like everything I ate this morning is gone from my stomach, yet I'm still not hungry.</i>

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.960
<i>My body's more responsive than usual,
 and I can clearly see what everyone else is doing.</i>

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.720
<i>Even I can tell I'm playing well today.</i>

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.100 line:20%
All right!

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.180
<i>The same goes for everyone else.</i>

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.180 line:20%
Nice, Daichi!

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.140
<i>Is it because of the barbecue?</i>

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.230
<i>Hinata's doing well too.</i>

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.770
<i>He's making no unnecessary movements.</i>

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.480
<i>We just might</i>

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.570
<i>be able to do the new fast attack.</i>

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.240
<i>But...</i>

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.870
Nice receive, Asahi!

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.660
<i>Is he planning on doing the new fast attack?</i>

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.710
<i>If we mess it up, we could destroy the good mood the team has developed.</i>

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.630
<i>We should hold off until the chance of success is higher.</i>

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.880
<i>You're not gonna do it?</i>

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.020
<i>The ball comes...</i>

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:11.980
<i>and then...</i>

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.190
<i>it stops.</i>

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.960
Wait! What the hell was that?!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.420
If we're gonna do that, tell me beforehand!

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.510
I just felt like we could pull it off! Didn't you feel it too?!

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:38.340 line:20%
I did, but it was too sudden!

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:38.340
What the hell? Is that weird fast attack back?

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.430
Not quite.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.220 line:20%
I've gotta mentally prepare and stuff!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.930
That was different from the fast attack they did before.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.310 line:20%
It's fine since we totally nailed it, right?!

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.310 line:20%
Wrong!

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.600 line:20%
C'mon! Let's do it again!

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.560
The first gear

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.780
is in place.

All right!

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.850
What the heck was that?! It was awesome!

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.810
Nice job, Hinata, Kageyama!

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.900
Hey, Akaashi. Was it really that amazing?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.650
Could we do it too?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.780
That's something we should never try.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.870
Hinata hit it like it was nothing,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.580
but I think that set is really hard to hit unless you're used to it.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.750
Not to mention,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.960
making a set float at the point of 
impact is incredible. I couldn't do it.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.680
<i>You're not gonna do it?</i>

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.920
<i>He dragged me along again. Dammit.</i>

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.920 line:20%
What? You wanna start somethin'?

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.630
That was awesome! So cool!

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.010
It stopped right before my eyes!

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.390
It was like, "shoop"!

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.600
I was totally sure it was gonna finally work!

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.890
But when it actually stopped in front of my eyes, it freaked me out!

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.560
You really <i>are</i> amazing!

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.650
Wh-What're you saying, you moron...

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.570
Amazing! You're so amazing!

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.240
The look on Kageyama's face defies description.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.570 line:20%
You're so awesome, Kageyama!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.540
What's up with his facial muscles?

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.530
It's not often that Hinata praises Kageyama in a straightforward manner.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.120
I'm glad we actually believed in this and waited.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.790
Yeah.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.750
Anyway, next time, make sure you—

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.750 line:20%
You did it!

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.710
You did it! You did it!

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.380
Nice spike, Hinata, Kageyama!

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.170
<i>They finally succeeded after three weeks.</i>

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.140
<i>Ever since that fight, Hinata and Kageyama haven't been on speaking terms.</i>

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.180
<i>Yet they both worked hard on improving.</i>

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.310
<i>And now...</i>

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.420
<i>the deviant duo is back in action!</i>

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.530
One more time!

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.240
I'm so jealous!

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.790
Let me look cool too!

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.000
We can't let them beat us.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.120
Let's keep it up!

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.120
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.210
Don't get cocky, you guys!

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.250
Hey, hey, hey!

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:19.550 line:20%
All right!

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.550
Shouyou...

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.730
always does something new.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:28.700
If Shorty was on our team, 
would you be a little more motivated?

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.930
It'd be impossible to be on the same team as him.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.230
Huh? Why?

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.560
I wouldn't be able to keep up with him 
unless I kept coming up with something new.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.490
No matter how cleverly I ditched practice, I'm pretty sure he'd notice.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.320
That first-year setter prodigy hesitated for just a second and Shouyou figured it out.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.200
That'd be exhausting.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.990
I see.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:58.460
Then would you be properly motivated 
if he was your opponent during practice?

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.460
What do you mean?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:06.260
Because when you watch him play, 
your face looks like it does after you buy a new game.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.510
No, it doesn't.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.140
Actually, what does that face even look like?

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.310
Really excited.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.350
What the heck? I don't know what you're talking about.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.190
I don't make that face.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:17.100
You do.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.270
I do not.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.650
You do.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.650
I do not.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.400
U-Um, Ukai?

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:30.740
To be honest, at first glance, I can't tell the difference between that and the old deviant fast attack.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.370
Oh.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.410
In the previous fast attack, the set would 
go right through Hinata's point of impact.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.960


00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.960
Point of
 Impact

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.380
Conversely, with this new fast attack,

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.000


00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.000
Point of
 Impact

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.590
they're trying to make it so that the spiker's highest point of impact is in the same place as the ball's point of arrival.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.640
Once the ball's forward momentum dies,

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.180
there's a brief moment that you wouldn't
 have if the ball was going straight through.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.940
That one moment existing is the difference.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.650
It means Hinata has more options while mid-air.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.650
Oh!

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.400
I gotta bring the old man to the spring tourney prelims.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.700
I'll show him their fast attack up close!

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.290
Nice receive!

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.850
<i>Kill the ball's momentum.</i>

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.000
<i>Kill it!</i>

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.340
<i>Shit! And everything looked the same as last time too!</i>

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.220
All right!

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.350
Oh my.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.970 line:20%
We got lucky!

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.310
Did he lose his incredible concentration from earlier?

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.560
Shake it off, Kageyama!

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.060
That <i>really</i> pisses me off!

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.480
Why's that? Besides, what else was I supposed to say?!

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.780
Well, it's not something you can always expect to go perfectly...

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.780
And what better time...

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.490
...for the upperclassmen to shine!

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.450
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.450
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.450
One blocker!

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.950
I touched it!

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.370
Got it!

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.660
<i>There's that weird sound again!</i>

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.790
<i>But a double hit wasn't called.</i>

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.050
The libero's set...

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.510
leads to the ace's back row attack!

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.930
The second gear

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.560
is in place!

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.690
It's out?!

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.820
That was so close!

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.220
Sorry, my set was a bit low! Damn it!

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.900
I-It was great!

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.620
I think that was more a mistake on my end.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.120
Please say it sucks if it sucks!

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.540
Oh, okay...

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.350 line:20%
I-I'd be so happy if the set was a bit higher.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.350
They changed this much in a week?

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.960 line:20%
I know that!

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.960
Terrifying.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.750
That's it! Keep it up!

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:55.800
<i>We still lack the experience to be able to go head-to-head with a powerhouse school while they're on guard.</i>

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.810
Got it!

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.760
Left! Left!

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.310
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.310
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.430 line:20%
Two blockers!

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.310
<i>In order for us to win,</i>

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.270 line:20%
We have a chance here!

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.230
<i>even if we suck...</i>

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.230 line:20%
We can score!

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:03.600
Got it!

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.610
<i>...all we should do is hone our new weapons!</i>

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.320
Now!

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:12.950
<i>Multiple spikers almost simultaneously 
make their approach from several directions!</i>

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.910
<i>A synchronized attack at first tempo!</i>

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.370
<i>The blockers can't narrow in on a target!</i>

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.870
<i>Everyone dives in, believing that the set will come to them!</i>

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.220
All right!

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.680
I nail spike... Seriously feel good...

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680
He's crying.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680 line:20%
All right!

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.100
He's babbling.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.690
I mean, it's been a while since nailing a spike has felt this satisfying.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.900
Dammit, they're attacking from every which way...

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.570
Nice set, Kageyama!

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:52.650
Thank you!

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.860
Nice spike, Tanaka!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.200
Thanks!

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.450
Keep coming up with something new, huh?

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.040
Stay focused!

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.370
The third gear

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.700
is in place!

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.790
That was a synchronized attack at first tempo.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.330
It went so smoothly!

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:08.840
Yeah.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.100
Against their three blockers, our attack had four people advancing at once if you include the back row attack.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.430
They couldn't follow all of them.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.930
Is something wrong?

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:21.640
No.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.850
There's just something I want to try out now.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.410
Damn it!

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.370
Yes!

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.750
Karasuno's at the top of their game.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.590
The messy attacks they were trying 
on the first day are finally succeeding.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.300
All right!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.010
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.010
Karasuno               Fukurodani

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.010
This is going great.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.470
We're actually neck-and-neck with 
Fukurodani at the end of the match.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.220
Yeah!

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.260
Don't get overconfident.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.600
The real battle begins now.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.680
Yes, sir!

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.020
It's true that you shouldn't let your guard down.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:11.820
But it's also true that the gears you guys have 
created are starting to mesh with one another.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.110
In the course of fighting out this set, 
please work on honing them even further!

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.490
Yessir!

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:24.490
Also, our plan of not letting their ace have free reign is going well.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.290
Well, except for that ridiculous cut shot.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.000
But that was because Tsukishima got a hand on a spike earlier.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.380
Oh, right.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.710
If we can keep number four under control, 
then victory is in sight.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.590
Let's finish this!

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.600
Yessir!

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:46.060
We're having a difficult time, but let's stay calm. We can't let Karasuno's attacks faze us.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.680
Yeah!

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.180
Right.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.100
Were you listening, Bokuto?

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.230
Yeah, of course I was listening!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.440
C'mon, let's do this already.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.040
Do you think that's...

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.660
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.660
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:08.660
All right!

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.670
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:12.540
That was our chance to turn things around too!

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.920
Don't worry about it!

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.250
Nice try, Noya!

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.340
All right, I'll leave them in the shadows with my serve!

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.800
Give us a good one, Bokuto!

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.460
Bokuto, stay calm.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:24.220
I <i>am</i> calm!

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.430
This isn't good. He's losing his temper.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.980
All right! Here I go!

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.530
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.030
Just calm down.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:39.900
Don't worry about it.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.110 line:20%
I'm sorry!

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:46.620
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:46.620
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.070
Hey, Karasuno caught up with them again.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.070
Yeah.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.620
Are they actually gonna turn the tables at the eleventh hour?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.450
Their number four can spike from any point on the court.

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.290
Let's aim for him with our serves to restrict his movement a little.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.330
Got it.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.250
<i>Crap! I aimed for the corner too hard!</i>

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.670
You jerk!

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.380
<i>Whoa, it barely made it in. I'm so lucky!</i>

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.300
Give it to me!

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.300
I'll finish this in one hit!

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.350 line:20%
There are few outcomes when setting to Bokuto while he's a bit angry.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.270
Seconds

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.270
Seconds

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:30.410
Seconds

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:30.410
Seconds

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.310 line:20%
A: If he scores normally, then there's no problem.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.600
All right!

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:22.400 line:20%
B: If he messes up or gets blocked again, he may start to feel even worse.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.320 line:20%
C: If I don't give him the ball...

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.820 line:20%
Hmph! I don't care anymore!

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.490 line:20%
...he may become uncooperative.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.950 line:20%
C is the most annoying.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.790
Bokuto!

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.370
Three blockers!

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.670
All right!

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.700
Got it!

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.170
Give it to me again, Akaashi!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.880
Here.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.170
All right!

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:44.470
Let's stop him this time!

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.550
Ready, and...

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.350
All right!

00:20:53.850 --> 00:21:01.070
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:20:53.850 --> 00:21:01.070
Karasuno                 Fukurodani

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.770
Wow, Karasuno turned it around!

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:00.230
Isn't this the first time they've been in the lead all week?

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.070
I think you're right!

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.280
W-Was that a block?

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:10.450
No. It didn't go over the net, so it was a failed spike.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.570
<i>Does this mean what I think it means?</i>

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.590
<i>Oh boy. It's happening, isn't it?</i>

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.010
<i>Really? This quickly?</i>

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.840
<i>Wow, already?</i>

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.170
<i>That was fast.</i>

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.590
<i>Jeez, here it comes.</i>

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.800
Akaashi...

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.230
Don't set for me anymore today!

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.060
<i>There it is. Bokuto's depressed mode.</i>

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.560
What the...

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.150
Okay.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.110
Huh?

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.240
But in exchange, please calm down.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.410
Could this be our chance?

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.580
Yeah, we can take this set!

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.910
I don't know what's going on,
 but their ace doesn't seem to be doing well!

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.120
Let's keep it up!

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.420
Yeah!

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.880
Hinata, we're gonna use that fast attack again.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.340
I'll give you the set you want, so have faith in me and jump.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.220
Okay!

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.550
<i>We're going to take our new weapons</i>

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.140
<i>and defeat Fukurodani!</i>

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:15.520


00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:34.060
We climb the mountain in our way

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:40.630
Losing more than just time in the process

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:46.640
Tasting freedom makes us want to fly

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.700
And notice the feelings welling up inside

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.100
It's almost in our reach

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.190
The closer we get, the more it shines

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.980
And stretches out in front of our eyes

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:05.350
That panorama created just for us

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:11.610
Until I reach the top and come back down, my lungs will keep breathing

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:17.870
But now I've been possessed by the desire to climb that summit once again

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:23.730
We cast aside all our doubt and set flight to the skies

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:30.890
Our flailing hands reach out and grab hold of the moment

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.890
That special moment

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.870
Come to us climbers

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.610
Come to us right now

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:45.570


00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.570
<i>It looks like we can finally win against Fukurodani!</i>

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.360
<i>Their ace was saying stuff like, "Don't set for me anymore!"</i>

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.570
<i>Do you think the winner gets to eat more meat?</i>

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.030
<i>Wait, won't that mean we get to eat less if we lose?!</i>

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.580 line:20%
We're absolutely gonna win this!
