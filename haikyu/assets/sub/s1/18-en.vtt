WEBVTT

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.010
Chance ball.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.460
All right.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.400
Nice kill.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.110
Nice kill.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.830
Dateko                         Karasuno

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.830
Tsukishima, one more. Nice serve!

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.050
If this give-and-take continues,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.810
Nice receive.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.080
#7's coming.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.070
Right.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.670
Karasuno could win the first set.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.340
But to totally get ahead...

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.680
That's it!

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.760
Nice one-touch!

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.970
Counter!

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.180
Chance ball.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.890
C quick!

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.850
Don't underestimate us!

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.270
That's the first time two blockers 
went up against Hinata-kun's quick.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.610
Karasuno                        Dateko

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.240
Amazing.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.870
It's our set point against Dateko.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.090
Haikyu!!

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.130
Episode 18: Guarding Your Back

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.260
Nice receive.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.130
Karasuno's on a roll.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.590
Give me a toss!

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.390
All right.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.480
Karasuno                        Dateko

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.110
Wow. Karasuno won it, for real.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.760
As expected, Karasuno's scary 
when they get on a roll.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.120
They might take the second set
 if they keep it up.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.380
Kunimi, you dolt!
 Move your feet, or you can sit out!

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.790
But I doubt we'll see 
a repeat of that first set.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.510
Because Dateko's giant, #7, will no longer
 be surprised by those quicks.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.530
Bummer, Aone.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.590
We'll take the next one. We will.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.180
That tall #7 and lastly that #6

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.540
managed to touch Hinata-kun's quick.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.480
Yeah. Amazing.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.790
The cornerstone of our offense
is that freak quick.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.980
We can't let them start 
blocking it, like Nekoma did.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.660
Tanaka               Kageyama            Tsukishima

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.660
Hinata                 Sawamura              Azumane

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.160
So, we're going to start the second set 
with our second rotation.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.990
The first rotation

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.160
directly matched up Hinata 
and no-eyebrows #7,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.220
so we'll shift that over
 two places to start.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.460
I see. That means Hinata-kun

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.890
won't get marked by #7 
like he was in the first set.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.770
But we can't completely avoid that.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.440
All we're doing is shifting players around.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.600
While Hinata won't get marked,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.950
but other players will get marked instead.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.900
We can't let Hinata 
shoulder all of our burden.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.620
When Hinata's at his best,
 we're at our best.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.450
I'll do my part as the ace.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.080
Asahi-san, you're awesome!

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.920
You've grown, Asahi.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.130
What are you, my relative?

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.040
Me too!

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.230
I can't back attack like you, Asahi-san.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.140
So I'll score as many points 
as I can while I'm up front.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.350
I'll be the best decoy ever!

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.850
Yeah, I'm counting on you.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.600
And you can count on me, too.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.750
Yes.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.030
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.030
Iron Wall of Date

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.750
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.740
The second set is about to start.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.750
I don't envy you, Tsukishima.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.000
You'll be facing #7 a lot more 
 than in the first set.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.240
Nah. No one expects me
 to beat their #7 head-on.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.460
It's Hinata's job to steal the spotlight.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.430
It's my job to keep trouble from happening

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.320
while Hinata's rotated into the rear guard.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.650
It's the usual situation, isn't it?

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.140
Besides, that blocker has already 
locked on to you, Azumane-san.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.110
Tanaka, nice serve.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.400
Nice receive.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.500
Karasuno made a double rotation.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.090
Left.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.080
I wonder if they're trying to avoid 
a match-up between their #10 and Aone?

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.130
It doesn't matter what the match-up is.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.170
The spiker in front must be blocked. 
That's all there is to it.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.560
We're usually cocky problem children...

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.550
So at least during the tournament, 
we should act like good underclassmen.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.140
Kageyama.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.550
All right.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.820
He was lured in for a moment by Hinata's move,

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.030
but he's already on the left...

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.020
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.820
Nice, Tanaka.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:33.850
Nice receive.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:34.820
Open.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.860
Here comes #3.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.910
The long-haired guy had the
 target area covered on that one.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.900
Our shrimp is the only 
player who can do a quick

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.420
when the receive goes awry.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.980
Nice, Aone.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.390
Okay, let's block the next one, too.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.850
Nice, Sawamura.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.560
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.140
All right.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.480
Karasuno's #10 is vanguard now.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.280
Bring it.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.960
It's up, nice.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.250
Kageyama, cover.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.240
Bring it here.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.620
He's so damned fast when he's in front.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.340
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.750
What a monster.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.420
All right.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.380
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.970
Even after Karasuno
 shifted their rotation,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.680
their quicks are still surprising,
 don't you think?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.840
But as time goes on, 
they'll begin to lose effectiveness.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.360
If Dateko wins this set
 and takes it to the third set,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.950
Karasuno will find themselves 
at a disadvantage.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.450
Karasuno must find ways to battle Dateko's #7

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.550
while their #10 is in the rear guard.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.550
The deciding factor will be 
how they deal

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.400
with the iron wall 
without #10 to act as decoy.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.040
Hinata, nice serve.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.810
I heard Karasuno's #10's quicks are amazing.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.040
Nice receive.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.870
Open.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.080
Where?

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.510
Oh, he's rear guard right now.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.970
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.450
Hey, Tsukishima.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.800
You said it's your job to keep trouble

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.540
from happening while Hinata's 
rotated into the rear guard.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.960
You're doing that against Dateko.
I say that's quite awesome.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.160
It's true that our offense relies on 
Hinata and Kageyama,

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.450
but it's also essential 
to augment their attacks.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.330
Just as spikers can't score 
without strong receivers to help,

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.270
playing our parts now 
will let us win the match.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.510
Sorry. Kageyama, cover.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.540
All right.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.390
The balls come to the ace 
when the going gets rough.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.050
Open.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.930
Azumane-san.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.640
Coming from the left.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.810
So what if it's an iron wall...

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.520
I'll blast through it.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.050
Iron Wall of Date

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.180
All right.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.490
Dateko's blocking is awesome.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.310
Asahi-san, one more.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.210
Although he's only middle blocker,
 it's like #10 is their real ace.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.870
Don't worry, don't worry.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.100
#7 is the best blocker in the iron wall.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.670
Things will get rough for his team
 if he doesn't rotate to the rear soon.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.500
Let's do another one.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.020
Will Karasuno's ace hold up?

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.100
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.150
Daichi-san, nice receive.

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.770
All right.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.940
#3, #3!

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.820
I won't let them break me again.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.740
One touch!

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.030
Counter!

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.240
Karasuno...

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.540
...has a wall, too!

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.050
All right.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.960
Whoa! They blocked the quick.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.220
After all, Karasuno's #3 and #11 
are their two tallest players.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.210
Nice block, Tsukishima.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.440
Thanks.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.300
All right! Block point!

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:21.820
Good. If Dateko scores,
 their huge #7 rotates to the rear.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.790
Next, next.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.760
One more!

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.930
Okay.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.480
Keep gaining on them!

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.940
Dateko                      Karasuno

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.620
Whoa, he's up. Karasuno's #10.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:32.690
All right.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.030
Only six more points to go.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.450

Get 'em while you can, shrimpy.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.560
#12, #12!

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.450
It's up. Kageyama, cover.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.040
Yes.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.620
Bring it.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.200
He's awesome.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.170
Usually they'd let the left handle 
that one, but he used a quick instead.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.760
Take that.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.220
We're going to stall them.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.820
Nice, Kamachi!

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.680
Iron Wall of Date

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.680
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.680
We just can't seem to pull ahead.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.890
Persevere. Go at it carefully.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.010
Nice, Asahi-san.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.000
Chance ball.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.190
Give me a toss!

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.360
Crap...

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.420
All right.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:23.420
Nice keep.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.410
One more!

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:28.620
One more to match point. 
Go! One more point!

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.660
Nice receive.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:36.500
Dateko's big guy is in the rear, 
and shrimpy's still vanguard.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.030
Nice receive, Noya-san.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.130
Chance ball.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.220
This is our chance to gain on them.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.410
Kamasaki-san, you're 
hiding in Aone's shadow.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.210
Are you intimidated or something?

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.010
Huh?

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.610
Cut the crap. All of us are...

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.270
The iron wall!

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.770
All right.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.480
Damn it.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.120
We'll score the next one.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.740
Sorry.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.960
And now it's #7's turn as vanguard...

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.540
We're counting on you.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.160
Don't worry.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.660
The freak quick will still work.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.620
But...

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.690
Nishinoya.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.660
Nice receive.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.040
Bring it.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:21.710
All right.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.250
That was too close for comfort!
 It barely got sucked in.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.220
At least it's match point now.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.550
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.510
Go! One point!

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.380
All right.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.720
You can block the next one. I know it!

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.460
We've only just begun.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.400
It's Karasuno's match point,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.860
but #10's in the rear guard now.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.050
And Dateko's strongest
 blockers are up front...

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.470
Nice serve.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.090
S-Sorry!

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.090
Nice judge.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.260
I'm sorry.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.260
Lucky, lucky!

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.780
Don't mind. Don't worry about it.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.540
Hinata, you lousy airhead!

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.010
You know what you did wrong,
so don't beat yourself up.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.950
Don't, you idiot.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:03.970
Yes.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:10.430
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.230
It's deuce if Dateko scores two more points.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.410
That's a very possible, 
given their current rotation.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.380
If it's deuce while #10's in the back, 
Karasuno will be in trouble.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.290
We'll get the next one. Don't worry.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.840
Dateko's #7 is amazing.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.800
Yeah. I thought he had me 
blocked that last time.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.320
But at least we have 
Asahi-san playing vanguard.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.860
Bring it, one point!

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.240
Asahi.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.370
Azumane.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.900
The ace is there. We'll be okay.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.600
Tsukishima.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.220
Nice receive.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.190
Here comes a quick.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.480
We're doing well, but they're wising up.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.280
#7! #7!

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.460
Cover! Cover!

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.200
Azumane-san.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.780
Yeah.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.240
What kind of ace am I,
 if I can't score this last point?

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.990
We've defeated this spiker once already.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.170
We're no Iron Wall if we can't do it again!

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.120
Moniwa-san, nice block.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.330
Crap, the rear is wide open.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.120
He saved it.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.310
Cover for me!

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.170
Spike it. Keep spiking as 
long as tosses keep coming.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.010
Left! One more!

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.470
Azumane-san.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.940
That toss is too close to the net.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.480
A joust.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.440
Get 'em, long-haired guy.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.640
It's too far...

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.930
So close!

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.480
Awesome.

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.140
He's incredible.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.600
One more!

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.310
Nishinoya, nice follow!

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.770
Get back! Get back in position!

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.780
I need enough distance to get up to speed.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.790
I must jump with all my might.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.400
As many times as it takes!

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.630
Don't lose concentration.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.700
Don't stop running.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.870
If I lose momentum, the ball will drop.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.980
Kageyama, cover.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:35.410
Yes.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.620
One more!

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.080
One more!

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.830
I won't stop 'til I score.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.750
Asahi spikes best when 
he's slightly away from the net...

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.460
...and has a high toss.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.870
Kageyama-kun's tossing to him again?

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.350
It's fine.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.060
Huh?

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.360
That was the best he could've done, Sensei.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.150
Go, Asahi!

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.650
Blast through, Asahi!

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:05.610
Go!

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:06.570
Go!

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.230
Go!

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.530
Dateko                        Karasuno

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.890
All right!

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.130
We did it!

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.690
All right.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.080
They did it! They did it!

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.790
Let's line up.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.760
Thank you very much.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.690
Karasuno

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.690
You did it, Asahi-san.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.330
Asahi-san. You went,
 "Boom!" past Dateko's blockers.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.670
And they went like, "Argh!"

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.710
And I was like, "Ka-blam!"

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.190
Speak Japanese.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.620
I'm the ace,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.180
but you guys are heroes.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.060
Heroes!

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.430
I like that.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.730
You did great against 
their freakish quicks.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.190
Spring tournament!

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.350
That's right, Moniwa-san.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.650
We'll get our revenge in the 
spring tournament preliminaries.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.870
The preliminaries are in September.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.670
We'll go back and start 
strategizing right away.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.430
We'll beat Karasuno if we play 
them in the spring preliminaries!

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.500
The third-years will be gone 
by the spring tournament.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.900
Why? Because they can't be bothered with us?

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.280
What are you talking about?

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.070
I've told you this over and over.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.170
The third-years' season ends
 after the Inter-High.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.210
But...

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.250
You guys are strong.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:46.770
Iron Wall of Date

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.510
They say we're a powerhouse,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.040
but they've also said our 
third-years are duds.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:46.770
They said we're a bad crop.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.990
We were able to maintain our reputation
 as the Iron Wall because of you guys.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.140
That's why, by the time
 you guys are third-years,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.690
you have to make it
 to the spring tournament.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.960
You'll have a new team and a new strategy.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.630
We lost in the preliminaries
 this year, but next year...

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:06.700
Aoba Johsai, Shiratorizawa, and Karasuno...

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.160
You'll conquer them all, 
and go on to nationals!

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.500
But...

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.430
Understood?

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:14.630
Yeah.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.630
We can't hear you, Futakuchi.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.840
Yeah.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.760
Sawamura! Sugawara! Azumane!

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.480
Congrats on winning your second match.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.340
Michimiya! I knew I heard 
the girls' voices behind us.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:34.560
You didn't notice them?

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.820
Aya-senpai.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.900
You got your revenge.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:45.370
Yeah.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.880
And we're gonna keep on winning.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.160
Um, Ukai-kun.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.900
That last toss.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.340
What did you mean when you said
 it was "the best he could've done"?

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.170
When a receive goes awry and 
we can't make an offensive play,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.140
the last ball always goes left,
 to the ace's position.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.380
I wanted him to know what it feels like 
to be the last resort

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.150
Thank you very much.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.100
and to wrestle a point away from that wall.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.500
Thank you very much.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.960
I see.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.670
That'll boost his confidence 
for our next match.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:24.760
From what I've heard, Azumane 
got beaten pretty badly by them before.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.390
But I'm sure he's fine now.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.540
He fought tenaciously against them, 
even without our decoy.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:38.370
It's also a matter of pride when 
the ball gets tossed to the spiker.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.380
Because it means he's earned 
the setter's trust.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.780
He's had two setters put their trust in him.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.740
That's got to give him confidence.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.470
I must admit,
 Dateko's blocking was downright scary.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.730
Right?

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:00.930
I wonder how they decided when 
it was appropriate to use

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.200
the first-year duo's crazy quicks.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.730
Come to think of it, they didn't
 use any signals during the rally.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.160
They didn't notice our signals, huh?

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.750
Yeah. They should be effective for a while.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:19.840
Your brains are made of muscle, 
so I'm amazed you thought them up.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.200
It wasn't us that thought them up.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.130
Oh, no wonder. Who did the thinking for you?

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.650
Sugawara-san.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.370
We did it. We got our revenge.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.270
Yeah.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.060
But then again...

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.000
I do wish my tosses could've 
played a part in the victory.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.530
Sorry about that. 
Please don't repeat that.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:48.580
I'm glad.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.980
I'm glad you still want to fight.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.000
I'm glad.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.870
Tomorrow's another match. We'll win again.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.510
Yeah.
