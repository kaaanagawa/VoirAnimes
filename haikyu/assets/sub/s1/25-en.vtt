WEBVTT

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.040
Haikyu!!

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.990
Episode 25: The Third Day

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.580
Intense Force 
 <font size="12">Shiratorizawa Academy</c>

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.300
Shiratorizawa!

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.480
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.910
Rule the Court 
 <font size="12">Aoba Johsai High School Volleyball Team</c>

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.190
Push it, push it, push it!
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.660
Shiratorizawa!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.090
I'm going to crush you today.
 You'd better be prepared, Ushikawa-chan.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.520
Stop calling me that, Oikawa.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.550
Aoba Johsai              Shiratorizawa

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.110
So hungry!

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.350
Let's go to the cafeteria.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.650
Hinata, let's go eat.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.340
By the way, I heard it was 
a close match yesterday.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.140
We lost last week in our third game, too.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.940
So the team that beat us 
ended up in nationals...

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.250
What's wrong? You're not gonna eat?

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.580
Bathroom.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.030
The first day that Hinata and Kageyama 
came to the volleyball club,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.430
Daichi-san said we'd be 
going to the spring tournament.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.530
The spring tournament...

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.280
Aren't the first-round preliminaries in August?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.900
We said we were going once more.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.160
We can't keep thinking about a match we lost.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.360
I think it's best that we back out here.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.470
Huh?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.760
I wanted all of us third-years to be able 
to compete in the spring tournament,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.370
so I wanted us to hang in there until 
then and go to Tokyo to fight.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.250
But...

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.960
After watching the first and second-years,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.820
I think it might be better 
to hand the club over to them.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.870
Their futures are so full of promise,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.600
that it might be better to let them start
 as the mainstays of a new team.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.130
That way, the team will—

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.130
Daichi,

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.930
do you really mean that?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.820
It's true that, as captain, you're responsible
 for thinking about the team.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.240
But I don't think you need
 to completely remove yourself.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.820
If you've already made your decision,
 I won't object,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.340
but if that's not the case,

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.580
then at least see things through to the end.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.050
As I already said, I'm staying.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.210
If the first and second-years 
asked me to leave,

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.380
then I'll think about it.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.770
And I'm staying even if you and Asahi leave.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.340
I already said I'd stay yesterday!

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.410
I'm not planning on going to college.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.240
If the first and second-years 
asked me to leave,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.420
I'd feel really bad.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.960
I...

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.750
Of course

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.980
I want to keep playing!

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.070
I want to keep playing 
volleyball with you guys!

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.380
Takeda-sensei,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.750
may I talk to you for a moment,
 in regard to to the volleyball club?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:00.730
Yes?

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.650
Karasuno High School Volleyball Club

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.360
You got to be in the game.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.590
How was it?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.570
Was it fun, Tadashi?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.460
No...

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.030
No!

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.990
I can imagine.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.370
Your body won't move right.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.030
The ball won't fly.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.380
Of course that's not fun.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.800
Up until junior high, I thought it 
was fun just to play with everyone.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.680
That was what volleyball was to me.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.110
But that's not it...

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.090
That's not it...

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.520
I want to be like the others, and...

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.030
I want to be able to make my body move right!

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.190
I want to control the ball!

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.990
I want to play on the same level 
as the other, better players!

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.750
To enjoy competitive activities, 
you need to be good.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.830
Coach Ukai...

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.970
I mean, his grandfather.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.000
He used to say that to me all the time.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.210
Of course, I wasn't the ace, 
or even a starting member.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.300
Practices were tough,
 and I thought about quitting.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.510
But...

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.730
The first time I managed a service ace 
at a match, I thought,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.150
"Man... How many hours did 
I practice just for this one shot?"

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.060
"If I can savor this one shot, 
this one moment, again,"

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.270
"I can survive those tough practices."

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.370
All right. Let's do this.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.270
There isn't enough time before the next match.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.590
Tsukki, let's eat!

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.430
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.100
I'm sorry, Tsukki! Tsukki!

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.480
Faculty Room

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.190
Sugawara and Sawamura are both on track 
to move on to higher education,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.950
but they've said that they intend to continue
 club activities even after the Inter-High.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.160
Especially Sugawara...

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.020
Pardon me...

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.880
Sugawara.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.400
I understand how you feel,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.250
but you should concentrate on your studies.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:33.030
To be honest, I don't see any merit 
in continuing your club activities.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.030
Sensei, I'm not playing volleyball for merit.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.930
Sugawara doesn't play regularly 
in matches, does he?

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.620
R-Right...

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.130
His chances of becoming a professional
 athlete are low, as well.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.860
Their grades are good, but I don't 
know if they'll be able to keep that up.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.240
Could you talk to the third-years?

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.600
Not about what they're doing right now, 
but with regard to their futures.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.020
Words from adults shouldn't 
be excuses for them.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.020
Those guys...

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:12.670
What's up?

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.200
I'm sure

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.130
they're pretty bummed.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.790
I canceled our morning and 
after-school practices today,

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.660
considering everything 
that happened yesterday.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.270
Aoba Johsai was strong, weren't they?

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.970
They were strong...

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.650
Ridiculously strong.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.350
This time, we were able to play 
a good game against them,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.040
but the next time we play 
against them, I don't know

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.340
if we'll be able to have the 
same level of enthusiasm.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.910
But Seijoh will probably come at us
 with the same level of power.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.330
Did you see them during their time-outs?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.170
Yeah...

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.750
The meetings were just the team's members.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.810
I'm sure the coaches have their backs,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.220
and they're giving them advice, but...

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.140
The players are constantly thinking and

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.600
figuring out what to do during the game.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.640
No matter what we throw at them,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.790
they quickly figure out how to counter it.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.850
And they won't break easily...

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.610
That's gotta be stressful.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.530
But...

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.180
Even in the face of Seijoh's power, 
they still managed

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.500
to steal away points by force.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.880
That must be what Shiratorizawa's like.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:46.320
All of our practices, experience, 
and strategies are being broken by force.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.310
Well, I guess the actual path
 to victory doesn't really matter.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.690
The one that lets the ball 
fall on the court loses.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.800
That's everything.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.060
If you guys try too hard and 
end up hurting yourselves

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.560
badly enough to affect your futures,
 but still want to play,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.410
we will probably stop you.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.640
There are times where it's 
not best to act based

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.380
on how you're feeling.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:32.230
However, if you're able to keep challenging 
yourselves, there are choices.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:33.780
That's what I think.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.300
Of course, I'm not saying that scoring
 poorly on an exam is nothing.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.340
To overcome difficulties, you need effort, 
endurance, and sacrifices.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.530
The hours you're putting into the club

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:52.060
are hours others are putting into 
studying and securing their futures,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.780
which will give them an obvious lead over you.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.150
You all might end up regretting that.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.110
Please choose wisely.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.040
Choose the path that you will not 
regret in five, or even ten, years.

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.910
Your back's too high.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.650
Yeah...

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.980
The finals should be wrapping 
up, shouldn't they?

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.150
Yeah.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.140
The ones who win are going 
on to the nationals...

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.860
They're gonna play a lot of games.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.320
Yeah...

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.830
Damn... it!

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.970
Damn it...

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.790
Damn it all!

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.030
I wanna win!

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.660
I won't apologize anymore.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.300
I won't throw any more tosses that I have

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.790
to apologize for.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.640
The only ones who'll remain on the court...

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.560
...are the strong.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.230
There's no time.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.190
There's no time to stop.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.070
But you need to eat your lunch.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.740
K— Sa—

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.480
Sh-Shimizu-senpai!

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.020
Also, stop shouting.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.330
I could hear you all the way 
in the club room.

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.170
Right!

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.080
Kiyoko-san!

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.560
You're beautiful as ever, Kiyoko-san!

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.590
We've come to see you!

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.970
We'll follow you forever!

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.720
Don't get hurt!

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:27.110
I thought you all had today off.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.320
Then why are you here?

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.740
Heya.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.490
Hey.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.870
Now, we're just waiting 
for the third-years.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.840
But there isn't club today in the first place.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.160
Hey, hey, hey.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.100
There's no way the third-years 
are going to quit.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.130
Huh? What do you mean the third-years...

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.320
The third-years are staying, right?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.530
They're still going to the 
spring tournament, right?

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.520
Crap, hurry.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.190
Yeah, we are.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.400
You're late!

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.860
Let's go to the spring tournament!

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.800
All right!

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.750
The day's finally here...

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.540
I wonder if some of those 
weirdos actually showed up.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.030
Nice job!

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.100
Nice job!

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.600
Thank you!

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.320
You guys are in good spirits.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.810
Please continue to coach us!

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.780
Please!

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.380
We lost in a match that decided 
our superiority or inferiority.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.480
Seijoh was strong and we fell to them.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.610
That is our reality right now.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.380
As for today's finals for the Inter-High...

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.300
The winner was...

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.350
Shiratorizawa.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.810
Shiratorizawa                   Aoba Johsai

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.470
Seijoh...

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.270
...lost?

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.780
There are teams stronger than Seijoh, 
even in our prefecture.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.650
That just means we have to get stronger.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.660
I'm pretty sure you know what 
our next goal is, but...

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.130
It's the spring tournament.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.120
For the third-years who will be participating,
 it will be their last battle.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.290
The spring tournament!

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.960
The stage on which the Little Giant stood.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.990
Well, then, let's have the 
captain pump us all up.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.390
It's the stage that Karasuno has been to
 just once in the past...

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.100
Tokyo.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.810
The Orange Court.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.860
We're going to go there one more time!

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.290
All right!

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.840
Take a break!

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.090
Right!

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.260
Kageyama.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.160
We're definitely going to win it next time.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:21.840
All of us are.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.600
Yeah.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.590
All right, break's over!

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.700
Right!

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.650
A tall, tall wall looms in front of me.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.820
Let's begin spiking practice!

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.240
Right!

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.040
Here we go!

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.460
Beyond that

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.500
is something

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.480
that I'd never be able to see on my own...

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:02.250
Next, Hinata!

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.010
Please!

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.810
Bring it!

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:18.940
That's...

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.010
The view from the top!

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.000
Thank you for your support!!
