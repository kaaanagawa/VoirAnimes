WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Hm?

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.270
Just one more time...

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.020
At the very moment Hinata is at 
the highest point of his jump,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.530
to set the ball at the
 optimum spiking level...

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.240
Then I will take aim...

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.450
...and swing!

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.100
Haikyu!!

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.540
Episode 13: Rival

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.750
The toss was a little too high.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.420
Captain.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.550
Nice save, Daichi-san.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.610
It's in.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.880
Front, front.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.270
Nice, Inuoka.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.600
Bring it.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.600
Tora.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.800
Let's do this, Hinata. One, two...

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.890
All right.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.060
Kai-san, nice cover.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.160
Wow, the supporting players 
on both teams are doing a good job.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.680
They're not flashy, but they 
keep the ball in play.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.530
There wouldn't be a match
 without them.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.910
Kenma.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.870
One more!

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.820
Even if I'm only average on offense,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.480
I'm still Nekoma's ace!

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.490
All right.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.500
Damn.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.420
Taketora-san is more fired up than usual.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.220
Karasuno's team has a a similar kind of guy. Maybe that's why.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.680
Or maybe he got inspired by the 
battle between Inuoka and #10.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.770
Hinata-kun and Kageyama-kun's 
quick sets haven't been syncing...

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.250
That's because they're 
trying to do normal quick sets,

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.380
instead of the freak quick sets

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.570
where Kageyama matches Hinata perfectly.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.160
But Hinata needs to develop his skills.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.410
You're still straining. 
Your timing's slower than usual.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.410
His body has to learn,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.750
and the only way is through repetition.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.000
He'll have to keep training, 
but once he has a unique set of skills...

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.260
...that duo will cease being
 an oni and his iron club.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.390
They'll become a pair of oni.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.930
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.590
Nice serve.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.680
Which way should I receive? 
Over or under?

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.130
Cover, cover.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.520
Ryu.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.800
All right! Asahi-san's not the only one

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.130
who can score in a pinch.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.140
Wow.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.450
He blew away the block.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.410
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.500
I won't just keep 
getting blocked by you.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.880
I'll block you, too.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.560
Hinata.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.480
Like Kageyama says, don't strain too much.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.130
Maintain a broad perspective.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.300
Y-Yes.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.800
Fukunaga.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.020
The guy with thick crewcut 
 dashed forward...

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.350
Maintain a broad perspective.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.270
And now #7, from behind #2?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.600
Nice one touch.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.030
Chance ball.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.320
Fast!

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.930
Nekoma's #7 reacts fast, too.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.210
They influence each other 
in a tight battle.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.340
At times, they push each other's abilities
 to new heights.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.800
They are indeed rivals.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.780
He got it through.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.300
It landed in.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.810
All right.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.930
Still a little too high...

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.730
One more.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.900
All right.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.280
Damn.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.240
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.960
We can't let them 
reach 20 points we do.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.210
Inuoka, serve.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.160
Yes.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.770
The lanky guy rotates to rear guard,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.020
and comb-head becomes vanguard...

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.550
It's fun playing against Lanky, but...

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.230
This guy is scary.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.730
Inuoka's 20 cm taller than you, 
and yet you've played an even match.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.330
That's amazing, shrimpy.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.130
You can call me a shrimp,
 but you're the real shrimp.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.770
Hey.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.480
What are you doing?

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.580
Let's do our usual quick set this time.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.360
The zoomy one, not the floaty one?

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.980
That's right.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.040
But I was starting to get 
the hang of the floaty one.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.200
Not this time.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.910
Not while that guy is vanguard.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.250
But why?

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.330
Just because.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.960
Huh?

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.210
It's my intuition.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.790
Inuoka, nice serve.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.450
Yes.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.840
That always feels so good.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.160
I think that was a good decision.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.800
What?

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.530
Sorry, sorry. I didn't react at all.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.960
I think the freak quick set is more effective

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.270
against that third year middle blocker.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.270
Kuro-san, don't worry.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.440
It's because the normal quick set

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.730
would be an easy target 
for that skilled middle blocker.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.900
Okay, it's my serve next.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.990
That sure was amazing.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.810
Get it over the net, okay?

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.700
Those guys are what you call superhuman.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.700
I know that.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.160
Okay, then...

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.890
Let's get that point back.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.640
Hinata, nice serve.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.490
Nice receive.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.840
Wow, they got jumbled...

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.160
Who's getting this one?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.550
It's gotta be that strong-looking guy...

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.550
#4!

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.310
Back row attack...

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.430
The three in front were decoys!

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.810
Our block's been completely thwarted.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.620
Chance ball.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.770
Who's next?

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.650
An A quick.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.180
Wow.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.360
In a split second.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.570
That was quite a solid quick.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.530
Maybe it's because he's keeping a 
close eye on our unpredictable Hinata.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.610
All right, my serve.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.740
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.750
Yamamoto, nice serve.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:20.660
Crap.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.030
Sorry, cover!

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.930
Open.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.630
Asahi-san.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.340
Who's attacking next?

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:30.800
Another A quick?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.720
He didn't jump!

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.810
What was that?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.970
One guy changes the timing.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.150
He fakes doing a quick,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.860
then spikes after messing up 
the blockers' timing.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.550
You don't see it used much these days.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.070
But he took the initiative immediately 
after that perfect A quick.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.490
Nice toss.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.010
That was impressive.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.790
Nice kill, Kuro-san.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.500
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.500
Nekoma's reached 20 points.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.210
It's over if they score five more points.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.190
We're in trouble.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.240
And I've already used up the two timeouts.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:13.110
Damn. He's smirking at me!

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.760
I don't know about that,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.700
but ever since their #1 
took the vanguard position,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.930
I can really tell that their team
 has an experienced offense.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.620
I agree.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.510
Half our starting players are first-years.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.700
They've just 
started playing together.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.940
If our team is Level 1,

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.470
their team is Level is 10 or 20.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.250
Yamamoto, nice serve.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.900
Nice serve.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.400
They're a fully mature cat, 
and we're a newborn raven.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.700
Yeah, something like that.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.550
In terms of defense and offense, 
we're no match for them.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.260
At least for now.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.840
In which case...

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.550
We have no choice but to fight.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.260
Pound them with your power and speed!

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.010
In other words, force them to surrender?

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.480
That's kind of villainous.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.520
Villainous, huh? That's fine.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.820
Ravens are sort of villainous, aren't they?

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.940
Ukai-kun, you look really scary!

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.040
We'll make up for our lousy quicks 
and receives with sheer brute force.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.160
You guys are rough around 
the edges and awkward,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.410
so use that as your weapon!

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.120
Wield your weapons with all your might.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.580
Attack,

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.620
attack,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.870
and keep on attacking!

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.550
Yes. Nice block, Tsukishima.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.880
Tsukki, nice.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.840
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.730
Don't mind, Inuoka.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.840
Sorry.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.520
Karasuno's reached 20 points.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.560
Karasuno's totally gone on the offensive.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:47.390
Don't rush things. Understood?

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.730
Yes.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.310
Good.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.880
Keep your connections solid.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.720
Yes.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.120
<font size="20">Karasuno      Nekoma</c>

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:02.830
Okay, one more point and we're even.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.790
D-D-Do your best.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.150
Calm down. We'll stop this one.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.000
Yes.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.260
Just when we thought we were out of danger,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.470
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.470
it's Nekoma's match point.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.690
One more point to go.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.430
Yeah.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:20.810
Damn.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.850
Does that guy ever get excited?

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.040
I guess he really is
 a mature cat, after all.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.560
Don't worry.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.640
Everyone is still fired up.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.500
All right...

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.460
We'll even the score.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.530
You won't get past me.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.840
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.770
That #3 is vanguard now.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.230
We can fake out their blockers' cornerstore, 
the middle blocker.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.970
Tanaka, nice serve.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.500
On top of that, Hinata is capable 
of thwarting him and scoring.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.230
And then there's Azumane, who 
is our most powerful attacker.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.690
Now that those two are vanguard,

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.120
Karasuno has its best chance 
of turning the tables.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.780
One more point and it's deuce.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.240
Yes. If we can reach a deuce,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.540
we'll have a chance
 to turn the tables on them.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.920
This is the moment of truth!

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.960
Nice receive.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.340
Hinata's quick is too uncertain right now.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:43.890
Go.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.440
He saved it.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.220
But...

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.440
It's coming back. It's our chance ball.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.900
Damn it. I'm sorry.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.860
Azumane, direct spike!

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.810
Crap.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.730
Slam it, Asahi!

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:02.450
Saved again!

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.160
Their chance ball again.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.770
That's how it is.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:07.680
Huh?

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.370
Even if we lose our bearings, and we 
can't get in a position to attack...

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.750
As long as the ball is still 
in play, we haven't lost.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:16.750
Chance ball!

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.380
Hinata's aura...

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.980
It's what I felt the first time
 I first played against him.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.920
His overwhelming presence  
at the most crucial moment...

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.100
As if he's saying, 
"I'm here. Give me the ball."

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.630
He's calling me!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.410
We did it!

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.640
The team with strong spikes doesn't win...

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.970
The team that drops the ball loses.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.310
And...

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.730
...that's what it means to "connect."

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.650
Karasuno      Nekoma

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.470
All right.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.140
We didn't make many mistakes.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.080
Our best weapons were 
working as they should.

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.490
Yet, we still couldn't win.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.250
Kenma, nice.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.490
They're a real team,
 not a group of individuals.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.550
They totally defeated us.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.830
Once more.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.060
Once more.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.310
Let's do it.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.110
Yeah, I'd like that.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.750
That's what a practice match is for, 
so we can do it "once more."

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.260
Nice course.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.000
Nice serve.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.520
One more.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.700
May 6 / Good weather
 8:50 Karasuno assembles at the sports park for practice match
 9:10 warmups
 10:00 practice match
 Karasuno Nekoma

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.700
We've been defeated fair and square.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.160
Everybody's...

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.410
...exhausted.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.120
Once more.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.280
Hey! You've been moving around like crazy.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.830
Is your stamina limitless?

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.760
Hey now, we can't.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.190
We have to catch the bullet train.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.050
Huddle.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.370
His granddad and I are old acquaintances.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.890
Your receives were particularly amazing.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.230
I learned a lot watching you guys.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.350
We did a lot of practice matches together.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.110
You thoroughly defeated us.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.400
They were good matches, every time.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:44.830
However...

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:47.860
You're retiring?

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.490
I'm getting too old for it.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.320
Sorry.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.190
I see...

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.070
Well, even if you're not around,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:00.420
we can practice with other teams.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.750
But a good rival is hard to find.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.190
Old Man Ukai made a comeback,
 but collapsed soon thereafter...

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.310
I was afraid Karasuno would be
 done for after that.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.110
But frankly, your abilities 
exceeded my expectations.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:28.010
Especially #9 and #10's quicks on offense.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.240
You guys are pretty much unstoppable.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.590
And you two on the left,
 you're both powerful weapons.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.280
Practice maintaining connection.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.170
Yes.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.450
As a team, you're rough-hewn
 and lack training,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.390
but you have overwhelming potential.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.380
The more you train, 
the stronger you'll become.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.050
You guys make me happy.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.310
We finally have a good rival again.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.270
Let's meet again at nationals.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.770
In front of a huge audience, 
in an arena swirling with emotions,

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.230
in that shining, glistening, 
enormous gymnasium.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.920
The Battle at the Garbage Dump.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.950
Let's have the best match ever.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:15.290
Yes.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.930
All right. Let's start cleaning up.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:19.870
Yeah.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.060
You piece of crap.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.330
You turd.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.290
Equipment Room

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.290
Come on, let's hurry up.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.790
Hey.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.960
Huh?

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.860
What's up? Still wanna fight?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.590
City boy. Come on.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.970
Um... well... your...

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:43.690
L-Lady... ma...

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.900
What's your manager's name?

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.060
You!

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.590
You plan on bothering our precious manager?

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.030
I'm gonna rub your fuzzy head so hard...

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.340
No.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.490
I do not have the courage to speak to her.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.130
Fukunaga, mop over there for me.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.010
Okay.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:06.610
Yaku, get me that mop.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.180
Kiyoko-san.

00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:17.350
She's Shimizu Kiyoko-san.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.320
Really?

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.890
She's the very embodiment of that name.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.740
Indeed, indeed.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.140
It took me a long time before 
I could speak to her,

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.310
so I know how you feel.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:28.610
However...

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.460
When you talk to her and she ignores you,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:32.990
it's still pretty good.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:37.450
That hurdle's too high for me.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.910
You're a pretty good guy.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.870
You, too.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.850
I'm Yamamoto Taketora.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.780
I'm Tanaka Ryunosuke.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.120
How long have you been playing volleyball?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.130
Who taught you?

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.220
How long have you been setter?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.080
How do you train?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.200
Do you get along with your team members?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.050
Have you ever hit a wall?

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.420
Our setter is a little more... intense.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.020
He was talking about him.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.560
You were amazing, Shoyo.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.150
You're like... Zoom! Bam!
 Oh, I'm Inuoka, a first-year.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.860
You, too. You're big, but 
you're like... Wham! Kaboom!

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.360
I especially like how you "argh!"

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.370
And I like how you "boom!"

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.270
And your smack hit me like "bang!"

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.320
It's not quite "bang!" 
It's more like...

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.340
What the heck are they talking about?

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.090
They don't sound like high schoolers.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.720
But you on the other hand, maybe you

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.150
should go a little crazy,
 like a high schooler.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.180
I'm not good at that sort of thing.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.230
Ah, youth.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.940
I'm sorry I'm so slow.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.910
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.450
No, I was wrong. Please forgive me.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.260
Stubbley over there is scaring 
that first-year half to death.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.540
They look like a kid and his dad.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.950
He looks more like a kidnapper to me.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:03.660
Um... That guy's really staring at me.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.410
I'm sorry. You'll be fine if 
you don't look back at him.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.650
#3, your receives were amazing.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:15.220
I've never seen anyone able to receive 
so many of our ace's spikes.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:20.120
Your entire team is high-caliber, 
and you're their libero.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.500
I think you have amazing talent.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.820
I'm going to do my best, too.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:24.890
Goodbye.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.610
Hey, don't just say that and leave.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:30.650
I'm sorry about that.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:31.850
He's kinda dangerous.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:32.810
Huh?

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.560
He's a high-caliber libero, too, 
but he's not arrogant about it, at all.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.620
On the contrary, he only seeks to improve.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.910
That's scary.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.700
Nekomata-sensei.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.730
Thank you for coming all 
this way for the match.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.660
No, no, thank you.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.560
Since you have no connections,

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.400
it must be hard for you 
to get games together.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.710
All those calls you made to me...

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:04.230
You even threatened 
to come see me personally.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.220
I'm sorry.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.060
However, your enthusiasm 
stoked my enthusiasm.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.520
Even if you're awkward, your students 
will follow you just the same.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.270
Do your best.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.240
Thank you very much.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.420
Keishin. Do your best.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.160
We played three matches 
and you didn't win a single one.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.120
I'll win them all the next time. 
Just you wait and see.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.090
Let's hope you're not all talk.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.400
Sensei, you're too confrontational.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.890
It's his fault. 
He looks too much like that geezer.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.300
That's an immature remark.

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.760
Ukai-kun.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.760
What you were saying about coaching 
only until the match with Nekoma...

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.040
Did you hear what he said to me? 
I can't bow out now.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.980
I'll have my revenge for sure, 
and on a huge stage.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.720
'Til we meet again, my friend.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.740
What's with them?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.530
Dunno. It's quite unusual.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.410
We won't lose the next time.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.390
We won't lose the next time, either.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.170
Terrifying! They're terrifying!

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.200
The next time around, 
things won't go your way like they did today.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.140
Fine. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good practice.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.050
And them, too!

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.130
They're so immature.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.920
Kenma.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.020
Shoyo.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.600
When we talked on the road the other day,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.340
you said you didn't
 particularly like volleyball.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.440
Oh. Yeah.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.390
How did it feel to win today?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.630
Sort of... normal.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.350
The next time,

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.930
we'll make you guys desperate.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.440
We'll win, and...

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.180
...we'll make you say, 
"I'm mad," or "That was fun,"

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.090
instead of just, "Sort of."

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:03.690
Okay.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.060
I look forward to it.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.360
If today's was an official match...

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.110
It would have been all over 
after we lost the first match.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.610
All over.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.570

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.420
I know.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.500
I'm glad you know.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:59.630
And the official matches,

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.910
the Inter-High preliminaries,
are right around the corner.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.320
When we get back,

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.340
we'll think about and analyze 
today's practice match.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.340
Then we'll train.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.190
Yeah.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.780
By the way, Kageyama,

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.820
did you ask that setter about
that feint and his other tricks?

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.370
No.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.860
For crying out loud Kageyama-kun!  
Are you shy?

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.780
Shut up, moron.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.990
Ouch! Not the iron claw!
