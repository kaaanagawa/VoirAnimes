WEBVTT

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.910
A perfect serve receive...

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.640
Could he be...

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.330
He's shorter than me.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.730
Huh? Hey, what did you just say?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.790
I-I'm sorry.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.210
Um... how tall are you?

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.220
I'm 159 centimeters.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.930
In the 150s!

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.130
Wow...

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.960
Wh-What?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.820
It's the first time I've looked
 down at someone

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.060
since I started 
high school club activities.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.580
Don't weep with joy about it!

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.150
You're not looking that far down!

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.610
Hey! Noya-san.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.570
Hey, Ryu.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.280
Nishinoya.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.410
Hi.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.530
Let me introduce you.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.380
This is Nishinoya, second-year.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.250
Hi.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.240
Hi. You guys are first-years, huh?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.070
You, the guy doing serves.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.870
The tall guy with the nasty glare.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.480
What junior high are you from?

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.750
Kitagawa Daiichi.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.720
Seriously?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.340
That's a power school.
 No wonder you serve like that.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.800
We played against you guys and lost 2 to 1.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.990
Your serve was amazing then, too.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.760
Noisy as ever.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.230
What junior high were you at, Nishinoya-san?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.980
Chidoriyama.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.080
That's a power school.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.480
Why did you come to Karasuno?

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.850
Because you heard coach Ukai
 was coming back?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.450
No... I came to Karasuno because...

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.610
Because I like the girl's uniform.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.620
Intensely.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.370
...

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.020
And the girls have lived up
 to my expectations.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.340
And above all...

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.720
because of the boy's uniform. In black!

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.270
I wore a blazer in junior high, 
so I admired this uniform.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.150
It's not brown or grey, but black!

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.260
I know what you mean.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.030
Karasuno has black uniforms, 
and the girl's uniform is cute.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.940
The school's close to home. 
It was a no-brainer.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.150
Kiyoko-san! I've come to see you!

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.100
He's like a hurricane, as usual.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.100
A guerilla downpour.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.620
Quite the noisemaker, isn't he?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.580
Yet when he plays, he's surprisingly...

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.690
...quiet.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.870
And? Where's Asahi-san? Did he come back?

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.370
No.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.820
That wimp!

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
Hey, Noya! 
Don't talk like that about your senpai!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.140
Shut up!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.470
A wimp is a wimp.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.790
If Asahi-san's not coming back, neither am I.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.610
Hey, Noya!

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.130
Haikyu!!

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.290
My job is to keep things connected.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.870
The sky is the domain of the spikers.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.800
It's not a place where I can battle,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.420
but if I keep things connected... 
as long I maintain connections...

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.420
the ace will surely score for our side.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.240
Even if the ball bounces off the wall...

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.930
I'll make sure it stays connected.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.170
So give me another chance.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.250
Give me another chance to 
let you decide the toss...

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.780
Ace.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.150
Episode 8: He who is Called "Ace"

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.110
U-Um...

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.370
Nishiya-san, you're a libero, right?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.520
You're a defender.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.500
That's "Nishinoya."

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.490
And what makes you think I'm a libero?

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.540
Because I'm short?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.250
Huh? No...

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.090
Because you're a good receiver.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.390
Libero is a position vfor good receivers, right?

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.280
That's right, isn't it?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.170
You know what you're talking about.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.250
Plus, the captain also called 
you the Guardian God.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.610
Guardian? What the heck is that?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.180
He's exaggerating.
 I'm not all that...

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.550
He really said that?

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.940
But I don't care if he called me
 a cool name like that.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.090
I won't bend so easily.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.630
Damn you, Daichi-san!

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.030
I'm still lousy at receiving,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.030
even though it's the most 
important thing in volleyball.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.300
So please teach me how, Nishi...

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.120
Nishinoya-senpai.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.470
You...

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.790
I'll buy you ice cream after practice.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.610
Huh?

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.100
Because I am...

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.310
...your senpai!

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.270
Does that mean...

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.170
That doesn't mean I'm going 
back to that club.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.260
I'm going to teach you. That's all.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.490
Thanks.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.860
So, essentially...

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.310
You go zip, then go whoop, and pow.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.690
Like that.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.350
It's no good.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.460
He can't explain it because
 he moves purely on instinct.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.920
Really? I sort of understood 
what he was saying.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.890
Because you belong to his species.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.490
When you explain something,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.780
all you say is "pow" and "woah" and stuff.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.630
Nobody else understands you.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.920
Libero is a special position, isn't it?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.730
Yes.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.520
Libero (L)

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.490
The libero specializes
 exclusively in defense.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.980
They're not allowed to make offensive plays, 
like serving or spiking.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.950
They switch places with the 
rearguards to solidify defense.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.750
So that's the Guardian God of Karasuno.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.350
How awesome.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.910
It would give us a real shot
 in the arm if he came back.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:25.130
Master of a hundred battles

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.750
He has a very strong presence, 
notwithstanding his short stature.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.420
You, I've been noticing your height.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.440
How tall are you?

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.160
Tsukki is－

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.510
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.130
He inspires confidence.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.130
Sorry, Tsukki.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:28.980
In any case,
 Nishinoya hasn't lost his touch at all.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.590
He said he continued training 
even after he got suspended.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.510
He mingled with the girl's team, he said.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.850
That sounds like Hinata.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.480
Um, Nishinoya-senpai.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.510
Hm?

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.100
You were talking about 
"Asahi-san." Who's he?

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.520
Moron, don't say that name carelessly.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.490
He's Karasuno's ace, for what it's worth.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.140
Ace?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.390
So there is an ace here.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.400
What's with the empty-headed look?

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.520
I... want to be the ace.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.330
Huh?

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.490
Ace? With your height?

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.140
I like you.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.700
Right? You want it because 
it's awesome, right?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.740
Good, good. Do it, do it.
Become the ace.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.700
You'd be far more impressive 
than our current ace.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.760
But then again, it's the 
ace that inspires you.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.900
Yes. Aces are awesome.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.050
The word "ace" has an awesome ring to it.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.880
"Setter" and "libero" sound boring.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.860
It's all right.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.580
But... in a match, 
when the crowd is going crazy...

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
even more than at an amazing spike,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.710
is when there's a super receive.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.830
In the battle of height that is volleyball,

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.200
libero is one of the few positions 
in which a short player can survive.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.510
But I'm not a libero because of my height.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.870
I'd be a libero even if 
I was two meters tall.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.790
Even if your side misses the spike, 
even if your side can't block...

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.830
as long as the ball doesn't 
hit the court...

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.510
in volleyball, that means you haven't lost.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.530
And the one best suited to do that...

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.070
...is the libero.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.320
A-Awesome.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.200
J-Jackass. Don't say it 
so sincerely! Damn it!

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.530
I'll buy you two kinds of ice cream. 
Soda ice and pear flavor.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:26.960
Thanks!

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.160
So, ace-wannabe.
 What's your specialty?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.050
Huh?

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.960
You're a lousy receiver, but there 
must be something you're good at.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.900
Well, um...

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.450
Decoy...

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.350
Huh? De-what?

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.770
Decoy.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.780
Why do you say it with 
such a lack of confidence?

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.270
Because it doesn't sound flashy 
like ace or Guardian God.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.180
Who cares how it sounds?

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.400
But...

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.540
If a spiker is able to score 
it's because of you, the decoy,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.450
then your position is just as important.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.490
Yes.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.760
Karasuno has the most formidable decoy now.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.600
Thanks to Hinata and Kageyama,
 spikes that have never worked are possible.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.260
Yeah.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.660
I feel we're definitely about to change,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.840
because of the synergy 
Takeda-sensei was talking about.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.800
I hope we change for the better.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.780
Don't be so doubtful.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.730
I know I'm being stubborn, 
but I'm begging you.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.690
I'm inexperienced
and pathetically inadequate.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.650
But those boys have wonderful potential.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.740
Please be their coach,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.770
Ukai-kun.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.870
You sure are persistent, sensei.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:53.860
Foothills

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.620
That's the only thing I'm good at.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.840
Being tenacious won't get me to coach them.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.840
My granddad was a coach, 
but I'm not cut out for it.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.220
Sensei, I know you want an 
technical instructor,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.810
but what you're really after is 
the illustrious name of "Ukai."

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.930
Frankly, there is that, too.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.840
Ever since Coach Ukai retired,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.960
our school gradually fell
 behind other schools.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.830
This year I was hired 
to fill the hole he had left,

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.460
but I can't even get other schools 
to agree to a practice matches.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:26.490
You think my illustrious name
 would turn things around?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.710
I implore you, Ukai-kun.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.670
I refuse.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.240
I acknowledge your commitment,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.910
but I don't want to babysit
a bunch of pesky high schoolers.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.470
I'll be back.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.770
What part of, "I refuse," 
don't you understand?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.590
I'm sorry for being so persistent,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.640
but,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.600
you'll understand if you see those boys play.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.570
I don't care how many times you ask. 
I'm not doing it!

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.600
Damn it!

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.320
Ouch!

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.500
All right.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.530
Hey, Suga. It's been a while.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.900
Please.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.510
Come back to us, Asahi.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.320
Nishinoya's no longer suspended. 
He's coming back, too.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.580
I see. I'm glad.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.580
It's reassuring to have Nishinoya behind you.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.420
And you, too.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.340
Everyone feels better when you're 
there to decide the toss.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.230
I appreciate the sentiment,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.430
but I'd get in everyone's way 
again if I came back.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.720
Listen to me.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.800
We have an amazing first-year setter now,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.140
and a formidable decoy.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.600
You won't have to bear 
all the burden alone any more.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.910
If you and Nishinoya come back,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.630
Karasuno will no longer be the fallen champs.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.640
Our team is on the verge of transformation.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.850
Now more than ever we need 
our pillar, the ace...

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.820
Azumane.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.030
The guidance counselor's ready for you.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.530
Sorry, Suga.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.500
You better go first.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.510
You're the one who wanted to see the ace.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.410
B-But the third-year classroom is scary.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.600
Wait, Asahi.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.460
Asahi?

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.840
What?

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.070
Huh? What are you guys doing here?

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.850
Oh, um...

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.060
Faculty Room

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.060
Yes. Yes.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:53.770
Thank you very much.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.470
No, you, too. 
Yes. Goodbye.

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.770
Good, good.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.680
This is our big chance.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.650
Something...

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.360
Training Camp 5/6
(Practice Match)
9:00 AM

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.030
Something is bound to change.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.570 line:50 %
Third-Year Class 3

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:12.390
Let me introduce our new members,
 Hinata and Kageyama.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.400
So you're the first-years.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.330
Hello.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.150
Hey. How many, this year?

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.000
He's shorter than Tsukishima,

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.000
Four.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.010
but there's something bigger about him.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.840
So he's the ace of Karasuno.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.960
I see.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.670
He's not as scary as I first thought.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.520
Do your best.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.180
What?

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.460
Aren't you going to play, too?

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.140
I want to become the ace,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.450
so I want to watch an ace play in person.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.580
Azumane. Sensei's waiting.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.660
Sorry, but I'm no ace.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.410
Is he injured or something?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.370
No, it's not like that...

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.240
I think...

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.710
He doesn't like volleyball any more. 
That's the problem.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.730
What? He's so tall and he's an ace! Why?

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.670
Asahi was...

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.650
the tallest in Karasuno.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:09.790
He had power.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.290
He rescued us when things got rough
and managed difficult balls.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.300
Everyone acknowledged that he was the ace.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.640
We trusted him.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.310
But...

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.890
Was he defeated?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.320
There was a match in which
 all of his spikes got blocked.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.600
He's the type to shoulder all the blame.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.710
What?

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.790
Would something like that 
make you dislike volleyball?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.750
There must've been other reasons.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.130
Like what?

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.550
I don't know.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.430
But we don't know for sure
 that he dislikes it.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.850
Rolling...

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.350
...thunder!

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.290
Nice receive.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.400
That's just an ordinary rolling receive.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.610
Why did he yell that out?

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:12.610
What was that?

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.590
Kageyama. Tsukishima. Yamaguchi.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.330
I'm going to lecture you all.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.560
Crouch down. I mean, sit down.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720
Get lower than my line of vision.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:22.410
Teach me! Teach me the Rolling Thunder!

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.000
Good job, everyone.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.630
I want you all to listen up.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.170
We're doing it again this year, aren't we?

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.380
Golden Week training camp!

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.590
Training camp?

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.050
Yes. We still need a lot of practice.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.020
One more thing. 
For the last day of Golden Week...

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.560
I've arranged a practice match!

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.890
Awesome! Very impressive, Take-chan.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.980
Who's our opponent?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.530
A venerated school in Tokyo, 
Nekoma High School.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.300
They call themselves...

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:54.520
"Neko."

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.870
Neko?

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.480
We've heard a lot about them.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.460
Our former coach and theirs were rivals.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.050
We played each other a lot.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.220
Woah.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.460
That's right.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.020
Those famous matches were called
 "Cat vs Raven: Battle at the Garbage Dump."

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.630
You sure those matches were famous?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.850
They've refused us for a while. Why now?

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.810
Yeah, I'll tell you the details later.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.000
But after I heard about that rival school,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.020
I had to arrange for a rematch of destiny.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.070
I think when he hears who our opponent is...

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.740
Foothill Store

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.200
He'll want to take action.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.940
All right. We have an important 
practice match coming up.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.780
Let's get fired up.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.860
Yes.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.190
Tokyo, huh?

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.180
I'll smash those city boys to smithereens.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.630
He said, "shitty boys."

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.140
Shut the hell up, Tsukishima!

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.380
Daichi-san.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.380
I'm sorry. I won't be playing
 in the practice match.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.350
Nishinoya.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.170
I wonder what the Tokyo school's like.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.170
Shoyo is a good guy.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.420
Are they strong?

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:06.020
The first-years are interesting
and a force to be reckoned with.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.020
How would I know? Just shut up.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.770
I feel this team is going 
in the right direction now.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.420
I want to train with you all, too.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.280
But...

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.820
if I played in the match and our team won,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.110
it would be proof that 
we can do without Asahi-san.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.370
I don't like that.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.080
He's always fought alongside us, but now...

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.020
I'm sorry I'm being difficult.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.360
Understood, but come to training camp.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.400
Huh? But...

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.960
Noya-san! Do it again. 
Show me the Rolling Thunder again!

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.730
Okay?

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.260
Good job.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.520
Good job!

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.580
I wonder if things would go smoother

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.790
for Sugawara-san and Nishinoya-san 
if Asahi-san came back.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.230
Who knows?

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:59.950
I heard Asahi-san takes all 
the blame upon himself,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.410
but don't you think Sugawara-san 
is like that, too?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.910
I guess they both have a 
sense of responsibility,

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.370
even though you don't win
a game by yourself.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.500
Y-You should talk!

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.880
I clearly remember your words...

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.300
"I wish I could receive, toss, 
and spike, all by myself."

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.290
Shut up!

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.220
"I wish I could..."

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.730
Everyone on our side of the net 
should be an ally.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.560
Huh?

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.220
I don't like it when we don't get along.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.330
I appreciate the sentiment, but...

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.360
Why are you so interested in me?
We haven't even practiced together.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.640
Because if you don't come back,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.710
the second and third-years 
will stay disheartened.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.160
You're being way too loud.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.430
You guys are interesting.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.150
But, I'm sorry to say...

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:14.310
I can no longer visualize spiking 
past high blocks in front of me.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.520
I can't get the thoughts of getting shut out,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.450
of seeing myself intimidated, 
and self-destructing out of my head...

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.450
You might think what I'm about to say 
is cocky for a first-year shrimp.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.160
I won't think that. What is it?

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.370
I understand how you feel.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.280
I'm short and have no skills, 
so I constantly get blocked.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.840
But now...

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:39.690
I have this guy tossing to me,

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.590
so I can get past any blocker.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.590
All the blockers vanish from sight...

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.720
And the view of the other side 
of the net opens up.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.730
Ah... I sort of know what that view is like.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.360
Then, at the highest point, 
the ball hits my hand,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.690
I feel the heft of the ball
 snug in my palm.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.150
I love that.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.400
I know that feeling well.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.700
I envy you, Asahi-san.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.660
I don't have the height or power 
to spike through blockers on my own,

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.280
but you do, Asahi-san.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.500
Maybe they've blocked lots of your spikes,

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.210
but you've spiked lots 
of points, too, haven't you?

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.430
That's why everyone calls 
you the ace, Asahi-san.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.770
It's time. Let's go.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.030
Moron, we'll be late for class.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.000
Um...

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.740
You don't win alone.
That's just how it is.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.570
That's why there are six
players on the court.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.120
I didn't realize that til just recently,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.590
so I'm not one to talk.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.590
Excuse me.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:01.920
Let's go home together.

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.880
Want to grab a bite somewhere?

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.130
One more! Bring another!

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.590
Shut up! I know that. Here goes.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.270
Yeah.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.820
And then at the highest point, 
the ball hits my hand,

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.620
I feel the heft of the ball,
 snug in my palm

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.670
I love that.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:36.410
I know...

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.590
I know it well.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.930
Next Episode Preview

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.260
I wish Azumane-san would come back.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.470
He had a stubbly beard.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.100
Huh?

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.070
Maybe I'd be like an ace 
if I grew a stubbly beard.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.940
Will a hair-growth lotion 
help me grow a beard?

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.520
Who knows, you numbskull?!

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.940
