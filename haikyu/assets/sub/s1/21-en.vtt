WEBVTT

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.240
Hey, Karasuno's switching setters.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.530
Don't get depressed.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.460
We're just changing up the rhythm for a bit.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.080
I'm sorry.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.130
I'm worried about him, but...

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.720
If these two break right now,
 at the same time...

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930
I said I'd be the one that defeats you!

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.870
Hinata, you're gonna get in trouble—

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.860
So don't lose to anyone else before that!

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.820
The match isn't over yet,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.360
so I haven't lost.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.450
You're going to get in trouble!

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.640
Guess I don't have anything 
to worry about after all.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.540
Kageyama, make sure you take stock 
of things from outside the court,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.000
and use that time to calm down.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.020
Watch how your senpai plays.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.020
Haikyu!!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.260
Hey!

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.550
Hey!

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.850
Hey!

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.100
Hey!

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.600
Hey!

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.100
Episode 21: Senpai's True Abilities

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.520
It'll be fine. Let's break their streak.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.230
All right!

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.780
What?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.700
Jeez, your face is scary.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.240
I was born with this face!

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.450
You were all irritated, 
and stopped talking as much...

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.210
I could tell you were thinking, and stuff,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.760
but if you don't say it out loud, 
I don't know what you're thinking.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.500
Wasn't I saying it out loud?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.930
Nope... You were quieter
 than in any other match.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.910
For crying out loud...

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.140
Damn it. I was so overwhelmed I end up 
having to hear about this from him?

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.090
Hey, the Karasuno setter 
that just went in is #2.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.570
Oh, he's a third-year.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.570
2: Sugawara Koshi

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.280
So some genius first-year that just joined
took his starter position?

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.450
Daichi, you're not being as loud as usual.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.390
A captain can't lose his composure!

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.740
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.600
The only person that can lecture Daichi...

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.060
...is Suga-san.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.540
Tsukishima.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.000
I don't know just how good 
Mr. Refreshing over there is,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.000
but seeing him up close, the words 
"serious" and "polite" seem to fit him well.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.610
Iwa-chan, the defensive block will be low 
straight forward where #2-kun is standing,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.100
so it'd be a good place to aim.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.850
Right.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.650
Nice receive!

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.930
Tanaka!

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.700
Iwa-chan!

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.410
I've got to aim...

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.120
straight forward where the block is low.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.050
Iwa—

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.840
Denied!

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.000
I guess they figured out they'd 
be aiming straight forward.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.880
Right? Well done.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.340
The blockers switched places right 
 before the opponent's spike.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.410
Nice block, Tsukishima. Nice, nice!

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.760
But you're the one...

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.790
Whenever we're up against a strong team,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.690
they usually aim right for me
 since my block is so low.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.690
I figured that'd happen this time, too.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.440
I feel so relieved, 
being next to someone so tall.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.150
Um, well... right.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.500
Sorry.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.210
Don't mind!

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.660
Sorry, Iwa-chan.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.070
Aoba Johsai     Karasuno

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.520
Hinata.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.360
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.330
Right.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.590
Nice receive, Kunimi-chan!

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.790
Whoa, they totally returned it!

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.800
Are they gonna do a quick?

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:26.680
A-quick!

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520
All right!

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.790
Hinata, great job!

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.480
It's just like you said, Sugawara-san!

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.610
Next time their receive 
goes directly to the setter,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.570
the center will probably do a quick set.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.490
Don't panic, though. Just jump 
a little higher than usual.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.450
Right?

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.820
I know I felt frustrated watching 
the game from the outside,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.920
but I saw the game more calmly
 than I would if I was playing.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.130
The time I wasn't in the game
 has been preparation for this.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.200
They seemed to be more fired up now.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.090
Yeah...

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.930
It'll be fine.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.920
Huh?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.210
Weren't you worried that Kageyama-kun

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.320
would get angry that you benched him,
 since he seems so proud?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.090
It'll be fine.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.970
Kageyama-kun's strength 
and how well he plays

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.550
is because of his great pride,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.950
but even more more, 
because of his drive to improve.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.110
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.110
Tsukishima, one more nice serve!

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.870
Let's break their serve streak!

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.710
Let's see, the next attack...

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.650
Right!

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.710
Let's go!

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.830
Nice serve!

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.120
I don't have the ability to do 
pinpoint tosses like Kageyama,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.060
so I want to signal what kind 
of attack we'll do next.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.010
"The poor third-year that was 
replaced by the genius first-year."

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.520
I'm sure that's how some 
people would see Suga, but...

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.230
They're not saying "bring it" or "to me!"

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.440
He's not Tobio, so there 
won't be any god-like quicks!

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.900
Right!

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.890
Suga is Karasuno's other setter. 
He has run simulations in his head

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.510
of what it will be like 
when he's actually on the court.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.080
All right!

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.460
I'm definitely inferior to Kageyama

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.980
when it comes to technique 
and physical ability,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.300
but I've spent quite a 
while watching our team.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.510
If it were just me against Aoba Johsai, 
I wouldn't stand a chance,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.510
but my teammates are plenty strong.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.260
Let's break their serve streak!

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.220
Right!

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.270
21  - 14
<font size="20"></b>Aoba Johsai         Karasuno</c>

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.310
21  - 15
<font size="20"></b>Aoba Johsai         Karasuno</c>

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.860
All right!

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.660
Don't mind, Hinata.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.650
Hey...

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.700
Nice serve!

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.360
One point!

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.570
Damn it.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.790
Now it's Oikawa-san's serve...

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.250
Bring it!

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.210
Go!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.300
Got it!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.300
Leave it to me!

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.110
Now he's aiming between them.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.110
All right!

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.180
He's aiming at the optimal spot!

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.610
My bad! I was about to get it!

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.710
And I overstepped my bounds. Sorry!

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:24.020
Go!

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.010
The front!

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.230
All right!

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.440
Aoba Johsai                                     Karasuno

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.440
Seijoh's at their set point.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.880
Damn.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.450
Just how many points did 
that guy's serves get them?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:43.370
If volleyball had an ultimate play, 
it'd be to take 25 points just by serving,

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.120
Let's finish this!

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.870
Yeah!

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.710
not giving your opponent 
even a single chance.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.460
That's what a service ace is.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.460
I got it!

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.670
Right!

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.430
#10 followed by #5 from the right...

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.310
No, it's a back attack!

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.150
Hanamaki, nice receive!

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.370
Hinata, it's coming directly to you!

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.790
This is the first time
it's come directly to me.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.070
You suck!

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.780
Oh, shut up, already!

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.080
Hey...

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:30.340
The timing of Seijoh's quicks seems 
to be a bit slower than ours.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.050
Build up just a bit more than usual, then.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.990
Jump!

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.140
Back! Go back!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.730
It's out?!

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.440
Aoba Johsai                                    Karasuno

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.440
We're switching sides. Let's go!

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:53.400
Ow!

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.370
So close, Hinata.
We'll stop them next time!

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.610
Right!

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.580
Damn it, that was close! 
They totally got our timing.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.290
Since #2 came in,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.950
even the shrimp, who was just 
moving purely on instinct,

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.910
is now thinking before he moves.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.550
Rule the Court
<font size="15">Aoba Johsai High School Volleyball Club</c>

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:15.620
Here.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.260
Here.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.710
We'll go as-is with our second set.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.470
Right!

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.180
Since the most troublesome thing 
we're facing is Oikawa's serves,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.640
we'll be changing up our defense 
to maximize efficiency with few players.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.610
Aoba Johsai

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.220
So Karasuno's attacks...

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.250
Since we were assuming that their only attack

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.330
was the quick with Kageyama and that #10,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.270
it totally throws us off
 when they do normal attacks.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.410
We end up looking toward #10 too much.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.720
Iwa-chan, if you think too hard 
when you don't have a brain,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.220
you're going to hurt your head.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.500
It's true that even in our practice match, 
all eyes were on Kageyama.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.550
To think they had another special setter...

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.580
Sugawara-san!

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.210
Yeah?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.110
Kindachi's... Um, Radish's...

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.330
Could it be that #12's 
quick timing is a bit slow?

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.890
I think it is!

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.690
He looks, and looks... and then hits 
the ball. Or something like that.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.040
Oh, also... I just realized this 
when I came into the game,

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.050
Now that someone completely unknown, 
Sugawara, is controlling our game,

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.190
but our opponent will definitely 
aim for any holes that we have,

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.280
our opponents are in a state of confusion.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.070
so we can use that to our advantage.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.070
It's the gap between him 
and Kageyama-kun, right?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.500
Yeah. My original plan was to have him help

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.750
the other players regain their calm,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.790
but to think it would also result in this.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.620
We'll definitely be able to use 
this in other matches, too.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.830
Kageyama.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.590
Yes?

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:40.430
We... how do I say this, seem to be 
in competition over the same position...

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.460
I want to be in a lot of matches, too!

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.140
I-I do, too, but...

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.390
But now that I'm on the court,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.920
the enemies are giants,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.620
and their spikes are directed right at me.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.600
Honestly, it scares me.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.570
Before, I would have let it affect me,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.280
but now you've got my back.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.280
I feel really confident.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.100
The points we get when I'm on the court,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.740
and the points we get when 
you're on the court...

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.300
All together, they're points for Karasuno.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.080
I'll fight my best, 
and you'll fight your best...

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.420
That's how we're going to defeat Seijoh!

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.670
Right!

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.050
Kageyama-kun, are you feeling 
a bit depressed?

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.340
No, I'm not!

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.960
What the heck?!

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.020
I was just feeling sorry for 
you since you were pulled out!

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.350
Just worry about yourself!

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.870
What was up with that sucky direct attack?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.350
Sh-Shut up! That was my first time!

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.850
As soon as I'm back in,

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.810
I'll have you hitting one after another, 
so you'd better be prepared!

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.530
Karasuno                                        Aoba Johsai

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:39.980
Let's go!

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.370
Yeah!

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.250
Suga!

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.590
Don't you go into overthinking mode, too!

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.170
R-Right...

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.650
We're gonna take it back in the second set.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.300
And to do that...

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.290
We've got to plan for Oikawa's serves.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:13.980
Oh?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.700
Looks like Karasuno changed up their 
rotation a bit for the second set,

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.860
and Seijoh kept it the same as the first set.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.030
I wonder why they changed it, though.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.560
All right!

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.200
Nice, Tsukishima!

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.950
Oh, thanks.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.250
All right! Let's do one more!

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.940
Sugawara-san gives you nice
 compliments when you get one in!

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.120
I see...

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.330
It's not like being overly buddy-buddy,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.530
but I think he says what he does

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.840
based on the spikers' expressions
and how they're doing that day.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.550
And unlike the second and third-years, 
I'm sure for Tsukishima,

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.510
there are a lot of things he 
doesn't know about Sugawara-san.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.070
"Why do I have to match

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.390
what I do with how others are feeling, 
especially Tsukishima, that jerk?"

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.440
That's what's written on your face.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.780
Th-That's not what I...

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.880
But Kageyama,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.720
if Hinata seems to have a hard time
hitting the ball, you switch things up, right?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.880
Yes, because he misses easily.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.730
I think that everyone else also 
has their own techniques

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.710
and that affects how they hit the ball.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.580
I might sound biased, but...

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.470
I think our spikers are pretty skilled.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:28.050
I think that, too, but...

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.390
Then,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.250
if they were all able to hit the ball
 with 100% of their ability,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.880
don't you think they'd be able 
to break through a block?

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:41.760
One point!

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.200
It's the Great King's turn to serve!

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.570
Oh?

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.660
There're only two in position 
to receive the serve.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.620
...Oikawa's serves,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.200
we'll be changing up our defense 
to maximize efficiency with few players.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.330
When Oikawa does his super-fast serves,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.290
even the slightest hesitation 
or faltering is deadly.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.360
So, we'll use Nishinoya and Sawamura,
the few who recceived his serves, to counter.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.510
It's a formation we've 
never used in practice.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.260
But considering it's you guys...

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.850
We can do it.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.430
So cool!

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:20.660
The rotation they have for the second set...

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.900
The reason they changed things 
up a bit from the first set is...

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.650
...to bring this rotation around 
 when it's Oikawa's turn to serve.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.670
In the first set, they were able to get

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.700
We're going to break their serve streak!

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.620
five points due to Oikawa's 
serves breaking through,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.810
Yeah!

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.120
and his service aces.

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.860
If we don't return his serves,

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.270
we won't be able to defeat Seijoh.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.290
Bring it!

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.590
Go!

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.340
Daichi!

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.470
Yes!

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.930
Nice receive!

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.020
There's something important about breaking 
Oikawa's streak on his first serve.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.020
If he makes it, it'll be a heavy point.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.440
It'll be an important point, as well 
as a point filled with pressure.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.150
Right now, the one

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.200
who's feeling confident from breaking 
his streak in the first set is...

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:15.660
Tanaka!

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.230
I'm leaving this to you!

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.710
All...

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.590
...right!

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.470
They broke the serve streak!

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.340
Well done, Captain.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.610
All right! One point!

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.890
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.270
I think our spikers are pretty skilled.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.560
if they were all able to hit the ball
 with 100% of their ability,

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.340
don't you think they'd be able 
to break through a block?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.320
I have no complaints about 
the morale of our team.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:58.530
Seijoh is vastly better in terms
 of experience and technique.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.250
Let's get that point!

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.170
Yeah!

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.290
There's no denying that if they get 
ahead again, it'll be extremely tough.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.430
But if we hold on with all we've got,
 the momentum will turn our way.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:13.970
Karasuno                     Aoba Johsai

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.380
All right! They're equal in the second set!

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.230
All right!

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.060
Nice, Asahi-san!

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.210
Yeah, but the blockers are keeping up.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.890
Kindaichi, you're starting 
to read their attacks.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.130
Yes!

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.850
Mr. Refreshing definitely 
isn't a weak setter,

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.240
but all of his attacks are textbook.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.280
None of the set-ups are reckless.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.910
Karasuno's basic offensive 
strength is indeed high,

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.330
but we've played a number teams like that.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.360
Now, let's get our lead.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.790
Yes!

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:53.470
It feels like their spikes are going 
through our setter a lot more.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.510
Go, go, Hajime! Push it, push it, Hajime!

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.670
Yeah.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.240
Nice serve!

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:07.140
Karasuno                           Aoba Johsai

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.820
Seijoh just scored multiple points.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.610
A break happens when the momentum changes...

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.890
Don't let Seijoh get it now.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.150
Since they changed setters,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.990
Karasuno seems to be using 
their left quite a bit.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.820
Their left side is pretty strong,

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:27.000
but that might be easier to face  
than #10 when he goes crazy.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.510
All right! One point!

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.420
Slowly, I feel like I'm being strangled...

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.150
Yet strangely, I feel rather calm,

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.380
because panic hasn't affected 
my concentration just yet.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.600
That's because our goal is
 so clear in front of us.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.390
Go! One point!

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.770
I thought that getting benched proved

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.400
that you weren't needed anymore.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.440
Back then, I'm pretty sure 
that was actually accurate.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.050
Now you've got my back.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.240
I feel really confident.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.970
The things that Sugawara-san 
and I can do are different,

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.160
but I think our goal is the same.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.920
Left! Left!

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.760
Cover! Cover!

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.320
All right!

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.310
I want to be in it.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.760
I want to be in it. I want to be in it.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.120
I want to be in the game.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.150
I want to stay here longer.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:25.890
I want to stay with these guys.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.390
Give me the thrill of the court.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:32.240
I want to fight with these guys longer.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.570
Let me feel out of breath.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.200
Let me stand here.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.610
I want to touch the ball. I want to fight.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.700
I want to throw up a toss 
with my own hands...

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.450
...over and over.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.850
Then...

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.660
...I'll do my best, and you'll 
do your best, and then...

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.920
...we'll win the match that's 
right in front of us!

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.340
Nice receive!

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.980
All right!

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.870
Kindaichi, nice block!

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.830
Sorry, Hinata. I think that 
quick might have been too slow.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.080
Oh, it's okay.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.810
Ah, Karasuno's #9's been called.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.780
Looks like they're switching setters again.

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.340
I think I've probably 
only got one more play.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.820
Suga.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.300
Give me the next one. 
I'll definitely make it.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.830
Got it!

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.610
Nice serve!

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.730
Wow.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.710
It's a bit frustrating,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.210
but Hinata's face when he hits my toss
 isn't the same as when he hits your toss.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.550
I think you know this, but...

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.050
all of our guys are really strong.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.140
Right.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:27.930
All right. Let's—

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.640
Let's Win

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.390
Let's win this thing!

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:36.560
Right.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:37.820
Great job.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.140
Great job.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.730
You fought on equal ground with Seijoh.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.070
Well, all of our guys are strong.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.740
But you know... Next time, you can 
use the center more aggressively.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.200
Right! Thank you very much!

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.390
What?

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:03.290
I think the words "next time" 
meant a lot to Sugawara-kun.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.810
If we can bring out everyone's 
strengths effectively,

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.980
we can really fight Seijoh.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.570
But,

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:18.760
to move forward, we need Karasuno's 
ultimate decoy to be functioning at 100%.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.580
The only one who can make that happen...

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.740
...is you, Kageyama.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.000
Welcome back, Tobio-chan!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.180
I'm going to be giving it all I've got.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.880
Now, now, relax your shoulders.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.970
It's not like you can do much.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.840
Tsukishima! He's meaner than you are!
Are you okay with that?

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.100
I'm not exactly competing 
with anyone about that.

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.920
