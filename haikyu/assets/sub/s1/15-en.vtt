WEBVTT

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.140
Fly

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.150
I didn't know we had that.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.820
Do your best.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.420
You're all out of control.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.730
We're going to win the first round for sure!

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460
Yeah.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.180
We have the strength of a hundred men!

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.840
Hey.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.160
You know, this is going to be our last—

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.100
Don't talk.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.590
Huh?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.330
You were going to say something 
sentimental, weren't you?

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.930
"This is going to be our last Inter-High,"
 or something, right?

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.010
This is going to be our last Inter-High.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.370
Yeah.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.870
We've sure been through a lot together.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.860
Don't talk like we're about to die.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.460
What? That's not what I'm saying.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.210
The three of us stood in silence

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.330
last night gazing at the stars, 
contemplating our last Inter-High.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.520
I was hoping we'dsay encouraging things 
to each other, to raise our morale.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.290
But you guys left without saying a word.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.300
Shimizu's surprise raised our morale 120%.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.760
Well... yeah... but...

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:06.720
Miyagi Prefecture
Karasuno High School

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.160
We're going to win the first 
and second rounds today,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.930
then move on to day two.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.730
This is no time to be melodramatic.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.230
We're going to win all of 
the matches ahead of us.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.290
That's all we need to think about.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.600
Yeah.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.810
We're counting on you, Ace.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.160
I kinda get scared when Daichi is nice to me.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.370
Maybe it'll snow in summer next.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.620
Then maybe I should be stern.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.410
Good morning.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.970
Hey. I'll unlock the club room.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.370
Let's go.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.250
Yeah.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.100
Haikyu!!

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.460
Episode 15: Revival

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.890
I wonder what the Karasuno team is like.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.090
I hope there aren't too many tall players.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.000
Don't worry about it.
I hear they've been mediocre for a while.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.990
I think Shiratorizawa could win it.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:33.710
Ou

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.840
No, Aoba Johsai's on a roll this year.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.270
I hear Oikawa has surpassed 
everyone since becoming a third-year.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.710
Tokonami

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.710
I also hear Seijoh's first-years 
are amazing jumpers.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.400
Yeah, but still, they probably 
won't get past Dateko's blockers.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.190
I'm glad we're not in the A block.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.920
Let's see, this block...

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.890
Karasuno

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.890
Tori... Torino?

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:48.890
I think that's "Karasuno."

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.420
They were strong once, not too long ago.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.750
Oh, yeah, but not anymore.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.410
There's a saying about their team.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.740
What's that?

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.570
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Club

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.270
"Fallen powerhouse. Flightless ravens."

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.360
Hey, shut up.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.960
Flightless, you say?
 Is that what you said?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.750
Come on. Let's go.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.610
I'm sorry.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.880
No problem.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.290
Don't squabble.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.960
Yes.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.280
All black...

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.500
That one guy doesn't look 
like a high schooler.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.410
Hey, is that guy...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.850
That's Karasuno's Azumane.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.890
What? Who's that?

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:39.940
Don't you know?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.470
I heard guys from Kita High 
worked for him to extort money.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.970
Go ahead. You do it, too.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.660
It's a fight! The police! Someone call the police!

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.540
I also heard he sold illegal 
substances on the street.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.630
You'd better not refuse.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.020
You dropped your handkerchief.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.330
I'm sorry.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.890
And I heard he's been in 
high school for five years.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.540
He's an adult, then.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.290
Oh, well. It's the usual gossip.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.260
All because of his appearance.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.460
But I like to have sort 
of a wild appearance.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.270
You wouldn't say that 
if you were really wild.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.060
Who cares about how they view you?

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.030
Now this is what you call "wild."

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.240
Hey, check it out.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.720
The banner was quite effective.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.960
Do you think so?

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.150
It worked a lot better
 than that poem I wrote.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.320
Cute.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.570
Go say hi. I dare you.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.210
Should I? Should I try?

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.380
Stop that.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.840
Kiyoko-san...

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.990
...smacked us.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.090
That little guy...

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.780
Isn't he Nishinoya from Chidoriyama?

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.430
He won the Overall Best Libero Award.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.430
I'll be at my best today.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.210
Really?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.390
That's not all.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.400
That guy over there...

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.100
They say he's a genius setter.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.570
That's Kitagawa Daiichi's 
King of the Court.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.690
What's he doing at Karasuno?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.640
Dunno.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.740
He wasn't very popular 
in junior high, though.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.700
Then what about that guy there?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.480
That little guy.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.840
Is he awesome, too?

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.710
No... I don't think so.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.880
This place is packed!

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880
The Top

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.610
I... I'm aiming for the top, too.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.670
I'll do it.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.070
Idiot. What are you doing?

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.000
It's fine...

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.440
This gym is huge!

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.490
It smells like Air Salonpas...

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.450
What are you talking about?

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.400
That's the smell of tournaments.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.480
I know, right?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.460
It's them.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.490
H-He's huge!

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.630
Dateko

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.280
It's Date Kogyo.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.260
He has no eyebrows.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.100
You got a problem?

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.070
Hey, hey, hey. Stop that.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.700
No...

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.800
Futakuchi, help me out.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.570
Sure. Sorry about that.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.660
This guy targets our opponent's ace
 whenever he sees them.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.510
So...

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.340
...you better be ready.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.580
You guys are too rude.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.420
Why must you always do that?

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.000
That was a little jarring.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.240
Yeah.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.890
I'm amazed that you
 stared back at himー

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.980
Th-That was nerve racking.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.250
Why are you such a wimp off the court?

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.860
Are you all right?

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.190
Sawamura.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.260
Long time no see.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.930
Hey, Ikejiri.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.950
Sorry, I'll catch up with 
you guys in a minute.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.080
Yeah.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.560
Sure has been a long time.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.780
You seem... bigger.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.370
Have I? I think I'm about the same height.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.980
That's not what I mean...

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.290
Bigger in front, you mean?

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.590
No, that's not it.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.160
His presence has changed. 
His energy has changed.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.210
He's probably been training a lot harder.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.720
I saw you at the entrance.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.690
You were so intense, I couldn't 
bring myself to say, "hello."

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.860
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.120
But then again, the guys on our 
team are intense. That's for sure.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.080
They look really strong.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.290
You, too, Sawamura.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.490
You think so?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.450
Our team is puny.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.660
Ikejiri.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.970
I take that back.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.780
"Puny," "powerhouse," "fallen rival," 
all that stuff means nothing.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.340
We'll smash our opponents to pieces.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.780
I'm getting nervous.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.850
I know, right?

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.620
Did you see our opponents' spikes 
when they were practicing?

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.030
They're not in last year's 
best eight for nothing.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.060
I'm praying for the ball
 not to come to me.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.520
I should've shown up for
 morning practice more often.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.070
No matter how formidable and 
unbeatable your opponent,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.540
you'll never win if you don't
 believe you can.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.250
We had so much time.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.260
We could've trained so much more.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.570
We could've done so much more.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.340
Yui, it's too late for all that.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.920
But those things don't matter any more.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.060
The tournament whistle 
will blow in 45 minutes.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.660
All we can do now is get warmed up.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.930
We'll fight to the very end
 with all our might.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.600
And...

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.650
...let's win!

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.880
Huddle up, everybody.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.610
Form a circle!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.730
Come on, everybody.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.870
Karasuno, fight!

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.080
Yeah!

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.550
Hey. Is your stomach upset
 again or something?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.880
Tumbling with excitement.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.760
What?

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.100
I think he meant, "trembling with excitement."

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.440
No, he's just shaking with fear.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.210
I know. You got intimidated 
by Dateko, didn't you?

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.730
O-Of course not.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.080
Which is it?

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.590
Damn. He's overwhelmed again.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.190
I better do something about it quick.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.360
He can't do what he did at the Seijoh match.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.100
Asahi's cowardly too, but 
he doesn't seem nervous.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.110
"Cowardly"?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.830
I have a trick to calm my nerves.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.280
I try and remember the scariest 
experiences I've ever had.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.200
The scarier the better. 
Then I think to myself,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.640
"Whatever happens, it can 
never be as scary as that."

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.980
It puts me on an even keel.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.400
The scariest experiences I've ever had...

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.180
Math 4</b> 
Hinata Shoyo

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:37.270
Hinata?

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.680
I'm fine now.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.240
Hey, Hinata. What's the matter?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.970
If you know how to calm your nerves,

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.490
why did you get so devastated 
when we battled Dateko?

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.450
There you go again, Noya-san! 
You're rubbing salt in his wound.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.010
Because I didn't have enough time to visualize.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.710
Visualizing requires time and concentration
 to do be done properly.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.790
Sounds overcomplicated.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.630
All right. Everybody ready?

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.340
Let's be the first on the court.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:07.560
Yes.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.000
Finally, an official match...

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:44.370
Hold your ambition in front

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.370
Wow.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.340
It's spacious. It's huge.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.590
Hey, don't get intimidated.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:51.610
It's you who's intimidated.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.060
By the looks of it, it's you.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.310
Hey, don't get so mad.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.460
Fly

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.560
All right. Let's start practicing.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.990
Yeah.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.410
We need to watch them one last time.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.330
Especially the powerful 
quick of that first-year duo.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.130
Yes, sir.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.890
It's Aoba Johsai.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.540
They're tall...

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.520
They look strong.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.000
Speaking of, where's their setter?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.100
He's not here.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.260
Where's Oikawa?

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.060
Oh. Um...

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.690
What is it? Fess up.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.440
Girls from other schools 
have him in their clutches.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.880
Iwaizumi.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.780
Yes.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.450
This is delicious. You really made this?

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.950
Yes. I stayed up late last night making it.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.270
That's so nice. Thanks.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.840
It's nothing.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.590
Oikawa-san, can I take a picture with you?

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.930
A picture? Sure.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.260
Oikawa-san?

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.270
Ouch. Not even the coach hits me...

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.740
Sorry. Let's do the pictures another time.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.420
Hey, it's turnip head.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.140
"Turning-head"? What's that?

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:36.920
It's you. Who else?

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.540
What?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:38.890
Um...

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.870
Yoohoo.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.410
Tobio-chan, shrimp-chan. 
How's the freak duo doing?

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.440
It's the Great King.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.780
That hurt, Iwa-chan.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.340
Huh?

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.380
They have a libero.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.230
Give me another one.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.060
He wasn't there for the practice match.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.310
And that big guy wasn't there, either.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.430
Oh?

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.860
And their coach is new, too, right?

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.150
Hinata, don't dilly-dally.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.860
Right.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.750
New players and a new coach.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.200
I wonder how Karasuno has changed.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.150
It's finally happening.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:18.980
Teams will compete in this enormous place,

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.550
in front of a crowd.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:24.000
I think I'm more nervous than our players.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.000
Let's do everything

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.630
we can for them, 
to the best of our ability.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.710
Yes.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.460
One, two!

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.090
Dateko...

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.380
Asahi-san.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.730
I'm worried about Dateko, too,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.100
but I'm not going to lose.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.150
I think of winning, and that's all.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.360
So let's focus on our opponents now.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.070
Yeah.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:56.620
Captains.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.210
All the best.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.380
Only
Volleyball

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.380
Volleyball and
Nothing Else

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.010
Huddle.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.460
Line up.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.810
Tokonami

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.710
Wakudani-minami

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.790
Shiratorizawa Academy
Volleyball Club

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.790
Shiratorizawa Academy
Volleyball Club

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.510
Let's play.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.110
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.820
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.820
Date's Iron Wall

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.780
Listen up. This is everyone's first match.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:19.430
Everyone's nervous, everyone's anxious,

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.890
everyone's not their usual self.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.490
But you have to overcome 
those things before they do.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.690
Score a big victory first, 
and find your groove.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:27.680
Yeah.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.630
I'm mean what I'm going to say, 
and it's no empty compliment.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.020
You are all strong.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.940
Karasuno is strong.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.930
Let's show everyone in the gym
 how ravens fly.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.100
Take-chan, good one!

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.430
They say that inauspicious line
 everywhere we go.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.940
"Fallen powerhouse. Flightless ravens."

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.980
But let's show them,

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.320
"Look! We, Karasuno, are the
 champions of old. We are winners."

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.450
Yeah.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.410
Was that poetic? Was it moving?

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.780
It was fine. Fine.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.950
What does he mean, "champions of old"?

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.500
How am I supposed to know?

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.980
We aren't really, but the nuance seems to be 
that we were strong in the past.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.540
Hey, let's get going.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.940
Karasuno, fight.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.440
Yeah.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.220
Relax, and score your first point.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.180
Don't worry. Your training won't betray you.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.790
Tokonami

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.620
Just keep receiving and connecting.

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.770
Yeah.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.230
You mean #10 is their middle blocker?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.760
But he can't be more than 160 cm tall.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.690
Why are taller guys sitting on the bench?

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.980
Their opponents are confused,

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.410
but you can't blame them.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.120
I mean, a middle blocker
 competes with the tallest players.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.160
Little #10 is a starter?

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.580
He's not their libero, either.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:51.960
Those who underestimate him 
have another thing coming.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.520
Spoken from experience.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.210
I'll grind them to dust next time.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.050
Bring it on.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.060
Komaki, nice serve.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.900
Asahi.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:05.800
All right.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.900
The first score... who do I choose?

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:07.780
Nice receive.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.590
If we score first,

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.250
it'll boost our morale.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.770
The first to score has to be...

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:15.480
Him.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.750
This one's mine.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.200
Tanaka, nice serveー

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.430
Take that!

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.510
Nice openingー

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.370
Shut up! That's too much!

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.770
Karasuno's already in trouble.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.790
That was fast. How dumb.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.370
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.270
Let's turn the tables on them.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.250
Relax. We'll score back.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.720
Tanaka, nice serve.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.200
It's that baldie.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.800
Okay.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.830
Nice receive.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.830
Ikejiri-san.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.910
Amazing, he saved it.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.730
That libero is fast.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.650
Damn it. Couldn't get it to the setter.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.990
Asahi.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.200
Here it comes. Let's get ready.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.530
This one's yours, Ace.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.000
That old guy is awesome.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.530
I hear it's his fifth year in high school.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.640
Are you serious? Is that even allowed?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.170
Maybe he can't get out.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.050
Asahi, don't let it get to you.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.460
Wow, that's awesome power.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:26.510
Yes.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.220
Did you see the power of our left side?

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.560
But we have other weapons, too...

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.020
Shut up. I know.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.670
Tanaka, another nice serve.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.200
All right.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.160
You are all strong. Karasuno is strong.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.040
Let's show everyone in the stadium

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.650
that we ravens can fly.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.640
He's flying.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.080
Look!

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.950
Fly

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.430
We are the champions of old.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:42.980
Fly

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.810
This is Karasuno's revival!

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.470
Next Episode Preview

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.660
I've been waiting for this.

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.170
Let me tell you about champions of old.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.330
This is Sendai of Miyagi.

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:22.950
The champions of old are Karasuno.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.150
And that is us.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.790
Next time on <i>Haikyu!!</i>: 
"Winners and Losers."

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:27.980
Episode 16: Winners and Losers
