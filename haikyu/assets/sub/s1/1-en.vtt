00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.200
A tall, tall wall looms in front of me.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.290
What's the view on the other side?

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.260
What does it look like?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.970
The view from the top...

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.320
it's a view I could never see on my own.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.220
But if I'm not doing it alone...

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.670
Let's play.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.130
Haikyu!!

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.530
Episode 1: The End &amp; The Beginning

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.180
All right.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.950
Yukigaoka Electric

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.950
Congrats
<c.color3e514d>Karasuno
High
School</c>

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.470
Score.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.390
The "little giant" 
lives up to his name.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.220
That's five points in a row.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.280
Here we are at the National 
High School Volleyball Championship,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.770
spring season, where Karasuno 
High School's little giant

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.840
has been springing up and down 
among players 190 centimeters tall.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.260
Karasuno, is that the school 
in our neighboring town?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.980
Pretty impressive.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.360
Sho-chan, hurry. They'll take the court.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.200
Karasuno...

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.290
Approximately 3 years and 3 months later

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.470
Sho-chan wait up.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.300
It's huge.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.960
The smell of Air Salonpas!

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.740
Sho-chan, you're too nervous.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.420
They'll think you're a country hick.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.680
B-But I've never been in 
a real tournament before.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.860
Three years later and I'm finally here.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.500
It's sure been a struggle to get here.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.560
Izumi, Koji,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.130
thanks for being here for moral support.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.490
Stop it.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.350
Our tournament's already finished, so...

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.390
First-year students, you too, thanks!

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.670
It's a miracle the 
three of you are here.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.010
Oh, yes.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.880
We're total amateurs, but...

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.840
Don't cry, Shoyo.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.880
I'm not crying.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.170
You're super tearful.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.680
U-Um, Hinata-senpai, 
we should get started.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.890
Come on, Captain. Get on the ball.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.210
That's right.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.870
You dragged us here. 
We don't even know the rules.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.190
I know that.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.720
We made it all the way to the 
tournament, we have to win.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.670
National Junior High Team Sports     Miyagi Prefecture Volleyball Tournament &lt;Men&gt;

Combinations
<font size="30">Championship</c>

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.680
What?

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.080
You think we can win with 
our last-minute team pick?

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.300
Of course.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.630
What's our opponent 
Kitagawa Daiichi like?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.880
I don't know.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.750
But we're going to do it.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.510
Whoops, sorry! Come on.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.960
They're huge.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.460
What the...

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.240
Victory 
<font size="12">Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High School</c>

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.180
Kita-Ichi!

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
Kita-Ichi!

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.370
It's Kitagawa Daiichi.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.450
They're huge.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.640
They're so intimidating.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.910
They're candidates to win.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.760
The "king" is among them.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.610
Who's that?

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.970
Don't you know?

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.250
It's Kageyama Tobio.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.470
They call him the "King of the Court". 
He's an amazing setter.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.850
We're playing against those guys?

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.020
What's this "king" stuff?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.250
Don't worry about it!

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.710
Who cares how lanky they are?!
 I'll shoot past them.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.760
That's right, Sho-chan's 
jump is amazing.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.050
We're counting on you!

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.350
But first, the bathroom...

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.410
I never even heard of 
Yukigaoka Junior High.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.730
They're small in number it seems.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.000
They don't even have a libero.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.810
They're the height of 
elementary school kids.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.110
They're no match for us.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.320
Hey, dudes.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.760
Don't underestimate us.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.250
Soon as my stomach settles,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.640
I'll teach you guys a lesson,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.120
so be ready.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.350
Is this guy serious?

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.770
Yes, sir. We'll be ready!

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.170
Elementary school.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.790
He's got the captain label on him.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.650
Making fun of me...

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.140
Hey, second-year.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.740
It's time for the official warm-up.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.780
Hurry it up.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.590
I'm sorry, right away.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.240
Bad news, it's Kageyama-senpai.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.940
Hurry up, two more energy drinks!

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.390
We don't need to drink that much.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.850
Just look at our opponent.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.930
That's for sure.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.270
What did you say?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.170
You guys.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.760
You're not even on the bench.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.880
You think you're good enough 
to look down on your opponent?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.680
Don't ride the coattails of 
your school's reputation.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.620
S-Sorry!

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.130
Scary...

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.040
I was going to tell them 
a thing or two myself, too.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.230
You're not even physically ready. 
Don't talk big.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.940
That's why they look down on you.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.410
What did you say?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.600
What are you doing here, anyway?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.510
Making memories?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.900
I came here to win. Nothing else.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.970
You make it sound so easy.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.020
Sure, I'm not tall.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.210
But...

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.430
I can jump.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.410
You can't assume we'll lose,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.560
as long as we don't give up—

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.860
"Don't give up."

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.860
That's not as easy as it sounds.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.950
The six of us...

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.350
the six of us can finally 
play volleyball on the court.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.050
The first game, second game...

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.030
We'll win and keep winning.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.790
We're going to give it our all!

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.780
The first game, second game,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.720
the playoffs, the nationals...

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.250
I'm going to win them all.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.370
Sho-chan.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.180
Izumi.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.140
Why are you making that scary guy mad?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.780
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.160
Let's get back, hurry.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.000
How's your stomach ache?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.020
It's all gone.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:24.810
Huh?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.180
Crap. He's good for real.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.300
He's a setter.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.000
That's him, the so-called "King 
of the Court," Kageyama Tobio.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.200
By the way, what's a "setter"?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.540
That's the offensive position 
that tosses the ball.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.960
Setter

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.120
We studied it, remember?

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.950
We did?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.100
Your timing is slow.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.340
"Come in faster for the 
quick," I told you.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.500
My bad.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.830
Kageyama, don't focus on speed alone.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.800
What matters is not your own skills,

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.660
it's how you let the 
spiker hit the ball.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.940
I know that.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.160
This is it.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.310
It's finally about to start.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.440
Let's play.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.580
Our opponents sure are short.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:23.700
Koji.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.730
Your back number. Show your back number.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.410
Huh?

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.470
Koji.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.880
Sorry.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.250
Don't worry about it.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.970
Nice serve.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:46.230
Kitagawa Daiichi   Yukigaoka

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.080
Oh man, they probably 
won't score a point.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.970
Fine by me.
It'll be over quicker.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.230
That's a fact.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.390
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.940
Let's do better next round.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.200
Uh... yeah.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.870
We finally got here.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.530
We won't let it end so easy.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.810
What?

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.530
I'm the only club member?

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.540
Yeah.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.140
The club members got less 
and less every year.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.140
Plus, boys' volleyball 
isn't a club activity.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.370
It's just a fan club.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.450
Oh...

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.690
What do you want to do? 
Change to another club?

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:14.530
Or do you want to join the girls' team?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.960
Well, no...

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.760
I'll be a one-man team then.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760
Is that right?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.480
I'm going to be the little giant.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.760
You're going to be the what?

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.560
Nice serve.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.140
Here...

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.170
Gather round!

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.160
Let's go for a run.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.040
Okay.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.460
My chance.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.880
Izumin!

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.160
You're taking a break right?

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.420
Toss for me.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.850
"Toss"?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.810
I want to spike the ball.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.840
I can't. I don't know how.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.870
You just toss it up.
That's all you have to do.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.840
I can't. Senpai's watching.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.610
Gather up.

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.320
Right!

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.640
Hey, Hinata.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.680
I heard you're on the 
girls' volleyball team.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.440
Are you serious?

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.200
N-No, I'm not.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.580
Who are you after?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.960
There's a foxy third-year senpai.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.120
There is a foxy senpai, but...

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.160
I knew it.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.240
You got it wrong.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.760
I'm the boys' volleyball team.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.630
Victory 
<font size="12">Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High School</c>

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.280
You can't even enter a tournament.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.100
What drives you to practice?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.050
I'll enter a tournament. Eventually.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.200
I'll get a team together,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.970
though I'm striking out for now.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.240
But I will, you'll see.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.760
How about you, Koji?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.890
How many times must I turn you down?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.060
Hey, Izumin!

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.540
Can you spare just a little time?

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.060
I have after-school class today, sorry.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.580
Kitagawa Daiichi   Yukigaoka

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.500
I'm sorry.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.290
Lucky. Lucky.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.670
Watch out!

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.760
Shoyo, are you all right?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.400
Ouch...

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.770
My bad.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.300
Toss for me then.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.300
I got it this time...

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.730
Koji.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.570
Izumin.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.890
Hey, haven't you had enough?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.850
My arms hurt.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.700
I can't shoot the ball accurately.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.690
I've had it.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.190
Please. Just one more.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.370
First-year students agreed to join me.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.880
You keep saying "one more."

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720
This is the last one, okay?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.710
Got it.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.850
Here goes.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.580
Oh, sorry.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.010
Go, Sho-chan!

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.140
Sure, I'm little,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.890
but my legs can jump...

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.360
over any wall.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:20.420
All right!

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.150
Sho-chan, don't worry about it.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.400
We'll toss it for you again.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.620
S-Sorry.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.770
That was a good toss, too...

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.340
I'll get it in next time.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:41.000
Haikyu!!

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:48.010
Haikyu!!

00:13:52.600 --> 00:14:04.820
<c.colord3d6d5>++</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.890
Wow, that number 5 is a powerhouse.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.500
Yukigaoka is sneaking a few 
points in, in the second set.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.530
Thanks to their opponent's misses.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.490
It's up.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.170
Sho-chan.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.820
This is bad...

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.140
I can't see the other side at all.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.320
The opponents are totally 
seeing through their plays.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.160
Shame. That guy's got 
amazing jumping power.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.740
Shoyo, let's do this.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:21.810
Sho-chan, don't worry.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.960
Close call.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.700
Faster!

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:31.470
Nice.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.800
Reckless tosses today, as usual.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.440
I know. The opponents can't 
even block; what's the point?

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.460
What's he so serious about?

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.550
When will you guys get serious then?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:44.980
Stop it. We're in a game.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:52.740
<c.colord3d6d5>++</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.520
Scary.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.140
Kita-Ichi's setter is good,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.740
but it's like he's playing 
out there all by himself.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.440
All right.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.720
Service ace again.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:14:59.610
Not yet.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:00.920
He won't get that.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.600
It hasn't dropped yet.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.340
Not yet.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.960
Sho-chan!

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.070
Wow. Looks painful.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.440
He's trying hard.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:16.390
<c.colord3d6d5>++</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.600
One more point and it's 
curtains for Yukigaoka.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.400
Yeah.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.010
Damn it...

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.400
Excuse me, um... I...

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.850
Sorry. I'll get the next one.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.640
Um!

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.060
We don't want to get injured.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.810
We're out of their 
league to begin with...

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.050
One more, same way.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.330
Why must you do this?

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.020
Um... what?

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.030
Huh?

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.390
I don't know what you mean.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.260
But...

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.450
we haven't lost yet.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.390
That's right. It's simple.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.710
No matter how challenging the volley,

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.420
there's only one reason 
we chase the ball.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:54.550
Koji.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.060
The ball hasn't hit the court yet.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.010
Sho-chan.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:03.060
There's only one reason 
we continue fighting.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.270
Because we haven't lost yet.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.050
One touch!

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.570
You touched it!

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.430
Cover it!

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.200
I can't do this...

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.410
Score.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.580
<c.colord3d6d5>--</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.380
Don't give up on the ball!

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.230
M-My bad.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.770
We haven't won yet. 
You can't let down your guard.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.800
I know, but look at the points.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.210
Not unless a miracle happens...

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.560
That last point was no miracle.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.140
He scored a genuine point.

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:44.050
That guy. He scored a genuine point.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.740
Well, sure, but...

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.280
As long as we don't give up...

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.990
It's in the net!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.240
It's dropping, forward, forward!

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.120
All right, Sho-chan, 
we're counting on you.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.040
Toss miss?

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.960
There was no double hit.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.020
But there was no one there...

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.290
We should've been on the left.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.000
We had it marked.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.360
So why...

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.150
why is he here?

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.200
Sho-chan!

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.280
You there, are you all right?

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.570
O-Out?

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.780
<c.colord3d6d5>++</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.820
Sho-chan, are you hurt?

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.820
This guy overwhelms me.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.040
We scored only because 
their setter missed.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.490
He knew there was no back set,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.120
yet he still hit the ball?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.510
He was able to handle that toss?

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.260
Sho-chan. We have to line up.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.610
High level of physical 
agility and reflexes.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.590
Hey, Kageyama.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.600
What are you doing? Get in line!

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.060
Finely tuned bodily control

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.430
and his obsession with victory.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.660
He's got it all.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.060
What were you doing 
for the last three years?

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.080
What did he say?

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.460
Stay out of it.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.670
What do you know about what 
he did the last three years?

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:26.760
What's the point of 
telling him about that?

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.130
Yeah, but...

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:30.620
My first and last official match of junior high...

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.620
Boys, hurry up and get in line.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.210
Sho-chan, let's line up.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.170
<c.colord3d6d5>++</c><c.color292925>Yukigaoka   Kitagawa Daiichi</c>

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.760
<i>Our sets: zero.</i>

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.410
Total game time: only 31 minutes.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.480
"King of the Court," huh...

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:52.580
He's going to be a difficult opponent 
when he starts high school.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.170
My money's on that little guy.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:58.110
Karasuno High 
Volleyball Club

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.620
What did you expect?

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.240
They're candidates for the nationals.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.380
Man, I'm hungry.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.840
You're always hungry.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.720
It doesn't matter if 
they're strong or weak,

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.350
the bottom line is whether 
we win or lose,

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.760
and if we lose, we're 
off the court for good.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:35.870
Sho-chan.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.480
Shoyo?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.330
You...

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.770
If you're the king that 
rules the court,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.970
I'll have to defeat you,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.000
and I'll be the last one standing!

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.320
The last ones standing are the victors.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:04.410
Only the strongest.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.630
If you want to be the last 
one standing, become strong.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.010
What I'm lacking...

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.520
Thank you for today.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.750
D-Dumbass.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.290
You don't have to thank us.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.840
Huh? Why are you crying Koji?

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.600
I'm not crying.

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.590
Men's Volleyball Prefectural Tournament
 Kitagawa Daiichi
Bitterly Defeated

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.830
See ya, Shoyo.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.950
Take care, Sho-chan.

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.300
30-minute bike ride over the mountain.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.540
Starting today, Miyagi Prefectural 
Karasuno High School.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:45.330
Wanna join the soccer club?

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.600
Wanna get managed by the baseball club?

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.030
Here, the club applicants list.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.210
Thank you.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.280
So few... we used to have a lot more.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.050
It'll grow, Daichi.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.330
Kiyoko-san, looking 
pretty today as usual.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.000
She turns me on when she ignores me.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.180
I'm here. I'm here at Karasuno.
