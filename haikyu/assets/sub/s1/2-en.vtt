00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.690
Yukigaoka         Kitagawa Daiichi

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.430
My first and last official 
match of junior high...

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.710
My team was defeated.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.430
My opponent was the "King of the Court."

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.790
I'll get my revenge against that "King"!

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.770
That's what I pledged before 
starting Karasuno High School.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.520
But...

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.210
W...

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.210
W...

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.290
Karasuno

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.300
W...

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.300
Why is he here?!

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.340
Episode 2: Karasuno High School Volleyball Club

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.560
Why?

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.760
Why is this guy at Karasuno?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.370
Maybe he's just a lookalike.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.740
What are you doing here, anyway?

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.860
You make it sound so easy.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.820
I'll be the last one standing.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.910
What were you doing for the last three years?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790
No, no. There's no mistake.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.880
This guy is Kageyama Tobio!

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.420
I met you last year...

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.160
But I don't know your name.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.370
M-My name is Hinata Shoyo.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.100
You probably don't remember
 the team you beat in the first match!

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.430
I remember you very well.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.010
Your well-developed
 physical agility and reflexes...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.310
But he doesn't put any of it to good use.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.860
What? You wanna fight?

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.770
You were lousy!

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.260
D-Don't make fun of me.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.610
Sure, we got slaughtered by you guys.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.240
Next time, I won't lose!

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.690
That's what I pledged to myself, 
so what are you doing here?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.920
How can I defeat you 
if we're on the same team?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.000
Shouldn't you be at some
 other school with strong players?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.650
Why didn't you go there?

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.590
The strongest school in the prefecture...

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.640
rejected me.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.640
You didn't make it?

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.510
Even though you're the King of the Court?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.810
Don't...

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.150
...call me that!

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.260
Huh?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.690
The first setter of Kitagawa is on our team?

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.660
But the guy's totally cocky.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.820
Don't try and intimidate him, okay?

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.120
I-I wouldn't do something like that.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.660
Hello.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.370
Karasuno High School 
 Volleyball Club

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.710
Hey, hey, hey. Who said you guys could...

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.300
You're Kageyama?

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.710
Osu.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.750
Glad you're here.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.760
You're quite tall.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.110
He needs an initiation, Suga-san!

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.820
Let's give him a reason to be 
intimidated by us third-years!

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.390
Tanaka, stop with that face.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.040
Kageyama is slightly taller.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.650
But high-schoolers are kinda big...

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.110
That's right. I'm at Karasuno now.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.960
Alright...

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.690
Osu!

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.800
How tall are you?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.090
180 cm.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.910
Oh...

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.950
What? You're cocky!

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.200
Hello!

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.160
Huh?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.250
Oh! You!

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.710
Shorty #1!

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.330
So the other applicant here, Hinata, is...

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.770
You?

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.760
I'm a little surprised...

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.390
I see.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.270
So both of you are here at Karasuno.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.140
Um...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.650
We saw your match last year.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.810
You're way short and sucked bad,
 but you've got guts.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.650
Thanks!

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.530
Your jumps were awesome, too.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.220
But you haven't grown much since.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.990
I may be little, but I can jump!

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.700
I'll be Karasuno's ace!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.910
Hey, hey.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.960
The newbie says he's gonna be the ace?

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.390
You've got some nerve.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.120
It's good to be ambitious, right?

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.500
I'll do my best.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.430
If you want to be the ace,
 I hope you've improved.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.400
If you goof around,
 you'll waste another three years.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.230
What did you say?

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.460
Why must you say that, Kageyama?

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.030
I played with all my might.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.940
Yukigaoka     Kitagawa Daiichi

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.950
But...

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.750
But don't tell me
 everything I've done is a waste!

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.660
Guys...

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.920
You know, you're not enemies any more.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.470
Volleyball is about teamwork－

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.160
I'll challenge you.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.630
Hey! Daichi-san is still talking!

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.870
Challenge me to what?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.640
Volleyball, what else?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.100
How do you expect to challenge me one-on-one?

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.910
L-Like a passing contest!

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.980
How do you compete at passing?

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.830
Listen, damn it!

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.650
What's the commotion, volleyball club?

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.860
Yikes. The dean!

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.030
Sensei.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.820
Sensei.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.260
You'd better not be fighting.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.450
Of course not.
 Just a friendly rivalry. Right?

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.440
This dean likes to make trouble,
 so keep it down.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.320
Serve! I'll return them all.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.000
Hey!

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.790
I was only able to get
 one of your serves last year.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.710
Right in the face...

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.440
But I've been training 
with all kinds of people.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.180
I'm not the same person as last year.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.320
Not the same as last year, huh?

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.150
I'm not the same as last year, either.

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.820
Now, now, guys.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.630
Let's not get carried away.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.360
Is he a first-year student?

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.580
Relax. Don't be intimidated.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.860
Remember, you've trained 
at this with the old ladies!

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.660
Here goes.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.340
A jump serve?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.500
Last year he didn't—

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.040
I'm not sure <i>I</i> could've returned that one!

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.510
None of the girl volleyball players 
or old ladies served like that!

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.190
How's that different from last year?

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.270
One more.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.950
Hey. Enough is enough.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.720
They don't listen to their captain.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.980
This could be a problem.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:52.070
He has quick reflexes!

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.330
He's right in frontー

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.220
If this keeps happen—

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.020
He was wearing a wig?

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.570
You just noticed?

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.830
Everyone at the entrance ceremony could tell.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.180
You guys! Shut up!

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.930
Tanaka, you shut up, too.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.470
Sawamura-kun, I'd like a word with you.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.700
Fortunately, he's not punishing us.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.950
And no apologies necessary,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.340
provided you all agree that you saw nothing.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.870
But, you guys...

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.970
All because you couldn't hit a serve! You suck.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.440
What's different from last year?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.640
Are you kidding me?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.870
I was dumb to even think it.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.440
You suck!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.850
You talk too much.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.500
Hey.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.540
I want you to listen to me.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.190
I don't know what your motive 
was for attending Karasuno.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.620
But I'm sure you came here 
with victory on your mind.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.260
Yes.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.010
Of course.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.590
Karasuno was one of the top teams 
in the prefecture till a few years ago.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.690
It happened only once,
 but we even went to nationals.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.730
Now we rank at best in the prefecture's top 8.
Neither weak not strong.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.650
Other schools call us things like,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.570
"Fallen Rivals,"

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.230
and "Unflying Crows."

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.390
I remember well when Karasuno 
 competed in spring nationals.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.650
Students from my neighborhood,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.950
I'd pass by high school students

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.550
competed against the country's best teams,
 in a huge gymnasium in Tokyo.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.920
It gave me goosebumps.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.430
We're going to go there again.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.270
I'm going to the same court 
as the little giant.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.480
There are many

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.450
schools dreaming 
of going to nationals.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.560
You bastard...

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.960
Don't worry.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.910
I mean what I say.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.160
For us to make that happen, 
our team has be unified.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.430
And we can't have the dean
 keeping an eye on us.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.420
I'm not telling you guys to become buddies.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.480
Even if you were enemies on opposite sides
 of the net in junior high,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:27.100
I need you to understand that now, 
you're on the same side.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.190
Do you get it?

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.230
No matter how outstanding you are,

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.240
no matter how willing
 you are to give it your all,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.140
if you fail to get along, 
and hinder your teammates...

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:43.980
You're not wanted!

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.780
Until you realize that you're both teammates,

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.050
you won't be participating in this club!

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:11.980
Haikyuu!!

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:18.990
Haikyuu!!

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.060
What does it mean to realize
 that we're teammates?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.070
How do you do it?

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.980
Who knows?

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.190
Please let me in!
 Please let me play volleyball!

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.730
I'll get along with Kageyama, too!

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.850
Please!

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:36.310
Are you sure about this, Daichi?

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.630
They're still members.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.530
Teams come together gradually, anyway.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.740
I know that, but...

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.860
Out of my way!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.910
I apologize!

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.820
I swear I'll get along with this guy.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.800
Please let me participate in the club.

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.820
Are you sure you mean that?

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.450
If I had to cooperate 
with that guy in a match,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.800
I'd rather receive, spike, and toss all by myself.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.580
How could you say that?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.380
I can't believe you just 
told me your true feelings.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:21.940
But I think that's a good thing.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.250
Still, in volleyball, you can't drop the ball,
you can't hold the ball,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.990
and one player can't touch the ball twice.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.110
How do you plan to play by yourself?

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.510
Let me ask you something. 
Are you actually stupid?

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.000
Right!

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:47.840
Tanaka, block and follow properly.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.740
Osu!

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.230
The court and ball are in front of my eyes.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.730
And it sucks that I'm not allowed in...

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.540
Dammit! I have no time to waste like this.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.330
I'm gonna make them let me in.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.550
You realize we're teammates now?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.460
I'm a force to be reckoned with.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.850
That's reason enough
 for me to be on the team.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.100
Just what I'd expect from the King—

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.140
Anyway, what are you going to do?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.510
I'll challenge them

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.130
to a two-on-two match.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.490
If we win, they have to let us in.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.760
If we team up, we'll appear friendly
no matter how we feel.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.200
That will speed things up.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.110
We're going to challenge our senpais?

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.050
What if we lose?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.740
We won't lose. 
You have me on your side.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.070
Is this guy for real?

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.210
Does he really mean what he says?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.700
You just need to do the best you can...

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.260
...to not to get in my way.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.370
Huh?

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.710
Do you think anyone would agree to that 
and be all, "Yes, I'll do the best I can"?

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.170
So what do you suggest?

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.670
Keep gazing through that window?

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:55.020
In junior high, I was only in one real match,
 the one against your school.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.360
We didn't have enough team members
 to apply for a tournament till then.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.450
I couldn't have real practice,
 so I trained wherever I could.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.260
The gym, hallways, random corners...

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.990
In hallways?

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.380
So that first tournament...

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.820
When I stood at the center of the court
 in that huge gymnasium...

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.810
I felt the spotlight on me, 
I got worked up, like "Gwaaa!"

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.960
"Gwaaa"?

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.250
I wanted to stay there, but...

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.340
Staying on the court...

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.510
Men's Volleyball prefecture tournament 
Kitagawa Daiichi, bitterly defeated

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.510
Only the strong can stay.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.380
Well, what are we going to do?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.790
If we don't go in together,
 they'll slam the door.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.730
If I can play volleyball...

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.270
I can endure anything, for a little while!

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.950
No matter how obnoxious you are,

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.780
I'll do my best to keep from seeing you!

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.510
That's my line, you idiot!

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.780
Um...

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:57.160
Can you let me through?

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.600
Kiyoko-san, good to see you.
 I'll get that for you.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.700
Never mind. I'll hold it myself.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.290
Kiyoko-san, you're beautiful as ever today!

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.870
It turns me on when she ignores me!

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.160
Good job, everyone.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.200
They'll probably say, 
"Let us in if we can beat you in a match."

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.280
That's possible.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.750
But all they have to do is show just
 a little contrition, that's all.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.080
Captain!

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.790
Let us challenge you to a match.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.280
The two of us against you senpais.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.220
Are these guys for real?

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.300
One-two...

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.620
We'll prove that we can cooperate as a team.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.450
I heard them say "one-two"...

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.800
But I can't say I dislike these guys.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.810
And what if you lose?

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.020
We'll endure any penalty.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.650
Hmm...

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.990
Club Application

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.430
Then now's the time.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.990
There are two other first-year 
applicants besides you guys.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.620
It'll be a three-on-three 
match against them.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.230
We always play this game every year,

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.620
just to see what the new members are made of.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.460
But how does it become three-on-three?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.920
Who's our other team member?

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.890
Tanaka. I want you to be on Hinata's side.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.620
What? Me?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.130
You don't dislike them, right?

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.590
That doesn't mean I want to play with them.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.930
I see. I thought you'd be 
the only one here

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.100
who could discipline these troublemakers.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.460
Oh, well! I guess it can't be helped.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.520
I'll do it.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.830
Aren't you glad?

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:53.400
And if you lose the match,
 as long as we third-years are here,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.910
Kageyama will never play setter.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.660
That's all?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.660
That's because our team can't win
 with a self-centered setter.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.780
A guy who banks on his skills, but loses.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:08.510
What's the matter?

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.090
I'm not ejecting you from the club.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.020
You'd be good in other positions, too,
 wouldn't you?

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.590
I'm a setter!

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.520
Then win.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.380
You're here because you think
 you can win by yourself, right?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.850
I... I'm here, too!

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.850
The game will be Saturday morning.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.010
I... I'm here, too!

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.070
Listen up!
 Tanaka-senpai's gonna teach you a lesson.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.400
Understood?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.950
Are we being a little 
too hard on those guys?

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.000
That's true.
 You're stricter than usual, Daichi-san.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.740
Do you have some special reason in mind?

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.980
Dammit!

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.300
What? Are you mad because 
you're gonna eat the penalty?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.490
But even if you're not setter,
 I'm sure you'd do fine as a regular.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.180
And...

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.490
spikers are cooler than setters anyway.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.930
Wham, like that!

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.770
Bastard!

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.480
The setter is the team's control tower!

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.990
It's the setter that handles 
the ball the most in a match.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.240
It's the most dominant role!
 It's the coolest!

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.040
Huh?

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.700
And your favorite, the spike.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.580
You can't shoot without the setter.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:27.790
But setter looks difficult,
 and it's not very flashy...

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.980
You... Have you ever seen 
a huge tournament live?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.050
I haven't.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:38.280
It's hard to tell from the angles
 they show on TV...

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.880
But if you watch from the 
end side of the court,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.640
you can see the setter's 
super-fast toss really well.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.620
Zoom. From one end of the court to the other.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.150
The ball goes past the enemy's block.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.860
You think to yourself: "Hey! 
Can they really return that?"

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.010
But before the toss,
 the spiker jumps, and hits it.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.820
Wham! Like that.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.100
O-Oh...

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.950
Sure, spikers are cool. But...

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.290
But the setter tricks the enemy blockers.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.540
The setter tears down walls for the spiker.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.710
It's difficult, it's cool, it's 
fun, and that's the setter!

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.130
I understand why now you want to be setter.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.840
Kageyama will never play setter.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.560
Damn... why is that?

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.550
All you have to do is win.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.770
You were full of confidence taking 
on the senpais, weren't you?

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.030
That's right. I can't get anxious.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.520
I can't rely on this guy,

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.690
but I can send tosses to that second-year guy.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.350
Hey. We better do something about that 
sorry receive of yours by Saturday.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.640
Sorry? Well, but we can't use the gym.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.370
Oh, yes.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.630
Morning practice is at 7:00 AM tomorrow, right?

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.220
Of course, but why did you 
ask that all of a sudden?

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.810
Oh, uh, well...

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.990
Was the dean's wig undamaged?

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.590
Hey, stop talking about that!

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.780
Tomorrow...

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.030
5:00 AM.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.350
Don't be late.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.560
You don't be late.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.050
My bag! I forgot my bag!

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.020
Just as I was afraid of... it's locked.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.790
Then find a window you can get in from.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.410
We'll get in trouble if we're 
caught. Are you stupid?

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.080
5:00 AM sure is rough.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.410
Tanaka-san?

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.000
Get out of here before 7:00 AM.

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.050
Tanaka-san!

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.860
Thanks!

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.400
What a good senpai I am. 
Call me Tanaka-senpai.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.770
Tanaka-senpai.

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.970
Once again.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.010
Tanaka-senpai.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.940
Alright. Time to practice.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.900
That's true. You're stricter 
than usual, Daichi-san.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.110
Do you have some special reason in mind?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:08.080
You guys saw their match last year.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.380
Kageyama had outstanding ability
 as a junior-high student...

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.270
But his ability hasn't yielded any results.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.600
And he's self-centered, which means

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.790
he'll repeat the same mistakes as in junior high.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.420
He'll get in the way of the team for sure.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.760
But what's different from junior high...

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.010
is that Hinata is on the 
same team now with Kageyama.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:33.600
Hinata? Well, he's sort of a ball 
of athletic reflexes, but...

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.730
Yeah. He's far removed from 
his true potential,

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.480
but he has rare speed and 
reflexes, and his jump...

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.700
He didn't get the chance to play
with a setter in junior high.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.660
And Kageyama is seeking for a fast spiker
 who can hit his tosses.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.400
Those guys are imperfect 
 on their own...

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.300
But put their abilities together...

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.170
if we can utilize that combination...

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.760
Karasuno will make explosive improvement.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.810
Don't you agree?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.780
Cut it out! I'm going first.

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.680
Tanaka-san is in there. He was first.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.530
If that's what you think, move.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.180
Hey. There's no time...

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.650
These bastards have more problems
 than teamwork...

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.280
Ah, the gymnasium.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.030
You were here yesterday.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.220
The little giant practiced here, too.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.000
Alright.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.370
Let's do this!

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.140
Preview of next episode

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.890
Damn, I'm off to a terrible start
 because of that Hinata.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.490
That's because you said you wanted
 to do it all by yourself.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.500
I'd rather do it alone than with you.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.010
That's the wrong attitudeー

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.270
Hey, you didn't get up early just to fight!

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:24.900
Osu.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.030
