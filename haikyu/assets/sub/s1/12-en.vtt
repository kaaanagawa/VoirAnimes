00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.400
May, Five years ago

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.400
Karasuno Sports
Park Gymnasium

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.860
I'll see you at this year's 
national tournament.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.070
But you say that every year.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.030
Shut up. This year for sure.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.220
We're looking forward to the 
"battle at the garbage dump"

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.120
at this year's nationals!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.630
Unfortunately, both schools were eliminated

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.000
at the Inter-High preliminaries in June.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.010
In March of the following year,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.210
Karasuno High School of Miyagi

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.090
and Nekoma High School as 
second to represent Tokyo

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.770
attended the spring high-school 
volleyball nationals, but...

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.370
Karasuno was defeated in the third round,

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.650
and Nekoma was eliminated 
in the quarterfinals.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.480
Though both teams repeatedly played 
each other in practice matches,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.370
they never battled each 
other in a public arena.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.230
Eventually, both coaches retired.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.490
Subsequently, both teams plunged 
into a period of steady decline.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.330
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Club

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.250
But now...

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.760
Ah!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.110
The rematch of destiny is about to begin!

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.080
Haikyu!!

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.520
Episode 12: The Neko-Karasu Reunion

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.310
Kenma.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.640
Hey, you're with Nekoma?

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.970
Oh. Yeah.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.830
Why didn't you tell me?

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.850
Because you didn't ask...

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.220
But you said, "see you soon."

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.820
You must've known something.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.000
Your t-shirt said 
"Karasuno High School."

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.960
Hey, hey, hey.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.930
What business might you 
have with our setter?

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.110
It's fine.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.610
S-Sorry...

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.680
You, too...

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.020
What business might you have 
with our first-year?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.500
Is there a problem?

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.440
Wanna fight, city boy?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.650
We're going to "fight." 
That's why we're here to play the match.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.950
And stop the "city boy" thing.
 It's embarrassing.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.700
Yamamoto, you're always quick 
to pick a fight. Stop it.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.790
It makes you look stupid.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.060
I'm sorry about that.
He's an embarrassment.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.670
I'm sorry, too.
I'm embarrassed.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.210
A lady... manager... beauty...

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.050
Score!

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.490
A lady manager.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.270
We win yakisoba bread.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.730
I'll make you regret this!

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.870
Taketora-san, you can't escape.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.460
How come you know that guy?

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.590
I met him by coincidence during a town run.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.200
He said he's Nekoma's setter.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.750
Setter...

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.620
We're looking forward to our match today.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.330
We're look forward to it, as well.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.520
Wow, the ceiling's so high!

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.330
This is normal.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.000
This guy is the crafty type.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.920
It's been eight years. 
What's with the hair, Ukai?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.330
Shut up, Naoi. You haven't changed a bit.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.890
Hey, Keishin.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.690
It has been a long time, Nekomata-sensei.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.150
You look just like your geezer of a granddad.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.550
I'm Takeda. We spoke on the phone.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.270
Thank you very much for engaging us today.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.160
You barraged me with calls
 until I had no choice.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.730
I-I'm sorry.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.370
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.370
We've had good practice matches 
these last three days.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.870
We're looking forward to today's match.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.460
Yes. We are as well.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.330
Even though my opponent
 isn't that geezer Ukai,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.800
I'll show no mercy.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.100
Let me be frank.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.680
We've all just met.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.560
We're awkward and fragmented.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.560
But regardless, we're facing our first match.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.520
We know nothing about Nekoma's team, 
nor the kind of walls we'll hit.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.030
But when we find a wall,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.990
that's our chance to jump over it.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.330
We're like the blood in our veins.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.790
We must flow without stopping.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.960
Keep the oxygen moving

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.460
and your mind working.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.260
Let's do this.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.960
Yeah.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.050
Kuro, can you stop giving those speeches?

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.800
They're embarrassing.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.280
Who cares? They help set the mood.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.970
They're supposed to be thought-provoking.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.260
And that's that.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.240
We're on time.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.650
It's been so long...

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.110
since the last Battle at the Garbage Dump.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.320
We now begin the practice match of

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.530
Nekoma High School versus 
Karasuno High School.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.490
Let's play.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.760
You're not nervous today, right?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.630
Right.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.160
Wow.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.390
Short...

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.670
D-Don't underestimate me!

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.320
I'm not underestimating you at all.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.400
Really?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.130
Yeah.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.590
Underestimate him at least 
a little, you bastard.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.310
Shoya.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.680
I told you I thought we're a strong team,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.170
but it's not me that's strong.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.810
It's everyone together.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.610
Kenma, nice serve.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.670
Asahi-san.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.820
All right.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.260
Sorry, a little short.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.170
That's what you get for 
ditching a month, Asahi-san.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.030
I'm sorry.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.990
Kageyama, cover.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.490
Yes.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.910
Amazing speed. What the...

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.800
A fast attack from a place like that?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.480
What the heck was that?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.300
He wasn't watching the toss.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.620
That was amazing.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.610
I'm shocked.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.930
Nice, Shoyo.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:44.060
Thanks.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.170
Here goes.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.730
Fukunaga.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.280
All right.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.500
Nice receive.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.450
Another fast attack.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.130
That one was inevitable.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.530
We're counting on you.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.410
We're counting on you.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.340
Yeah.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.940
Good job.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.370
Thanks.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.390
Their libero is trouble.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.680
Huh?

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.230
He's never seen Asahi-san's spike, 
yet the ball hit his hand.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.450
I'm sorry.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:25.950
Excuse me. Please take this.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.630
Oh, yeah.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.420
Don't mind, don't mind.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.280
Nishinoya-kun switches position fast.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.690
Yes, liberos specialize in defense,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.570
so they can go in and out of the court often.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:45.290
Net

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:45.290
Vanguard

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:45.290
Rear guard

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.570
In our team, the middle blockers, 
Hinata and Tsukishima,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.190
rotate to rear guard to hit serves,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.290
and when one rally is finished, 
Nishinoya makes the switch.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.470
My turn.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.640
This is ridiculous.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.350
Forced to time out.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.060
Their libero and spikers are good.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.270
The most ridiculous of all is that setter.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.740
He's a monster.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.760
He tosses with incredible speed 
to the highest spiking point.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.350
His control is as if he's threading a needle.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.450
So he's a genius. We can't help that.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:26.290
But, a genius in their midst 
doesn't guarantee their victory.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.390
If Shoyo is the heart of their offense...

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.130
all we need to do is stop Shoyo.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.670
Shoyo?

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.370
That speedy #10.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.640
That #9 and #10 are, 
in a manner of speaking...

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.430
an oni and his iron club.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.150
For starters, we steal the oni's iron club.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.690
Nekoma          Karasuno

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.410
Amazing. We're doing well.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.220
I'm getting the creeps.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:52.860
Huh?

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.820
Like we're being watched, and analyzed...

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:01.620
Damn it.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.330
Nekoma          Karasuno

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.330
Don't mind, don't mind.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.780
That was close.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.170
Sorry.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.790
Their #7... he's following Hinata.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.590
Nekoma moved the blockers to the side.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.500
Yeah.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.410
A dedicate shift.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.430
Those blockers aren't there to mark the ace.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.430
Maybe...

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.890
they're trying to pin down Hinata?

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.100
We can't let Shoyo move around so much.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.320
From what I've seen,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.820
Shoyo simply dashes to where 
there are no blockers.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.860
So if the blockers move to one side,

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.320
he'll move to the opposite side.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.890
Then all we have to do is chase him.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.140
Yes.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.250
I think anyone would be shocked 
the first time they saw that attack.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.400
But even if we can't clear the 
first round of the game...

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.820
As they keep repeating the same move...

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.480
We'll get used to it.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.800
Chase #10. Chase #10.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.340
Touched again.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.520
Fast attack's coming.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.530
Damn.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.640
Don't mind, don't mind.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.240
That was a two-attack.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.520
Hey, don't get too overt.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.050
They can detect even the tiniest fault.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.480
In front!

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.480
Sorry, Noya-san! Cover for me.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.240
I got this.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.200
Right!

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.910
What? Kageyama called for a toss?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.620
Kageyama. Last.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.530
Hey, that's called a straight. 
It goes straight along the sideline.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.200
Learn to discriminate with your spikes.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.070
This guy's so good, it's irritating...

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.270
Totally.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.980
Nekoma          Karasuno

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.130
Nice one, Tsukishima.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:57.280
This guy is intelligent.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.660
He observes and thinks carefully.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.360
The complete opposite of Shoyo.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.070
Nice serve.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.040
Yamamoto.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.090
All right.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.080
Nice receive.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.220
Who should I toss to?

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.540
To the right?

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:13.210
To the left.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.310
I knew it. He's watching me.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.630
He also responds quickly...

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.340
All right.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.050
His glance just then... was a feint.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.230
He's not good with people,

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.790
so he's concerned about what other's think.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.020
Hence he's good at observing people.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.450
He comes up with good theories.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:38.650
Theories like, "I bet this guy moves like this."

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.270
But that alone is not 
the strength of our team.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.280
I've never made many friends.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.610
I'm not good with people, 
and I don't want to interact with them.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.230
And yet, I'm very concerned 
about what others think of me.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.970
My nerves were always on edge,
because I didn't want to be noticed.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.270
My only buddy was Kuro, 
who is my age and lives nearby.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.390
I don't particularly like sports,

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.750
but I've played volleyball for a long time.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.730
I reluctantly let Kuro talk me into
 joining the junior high volleyball club.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:31.830
It was sort of fun.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.290
I continued doing it in high school,
 just because.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.790
The school was strong until 
shortly before I joined.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.660
There were many people.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.060
I didn't think I could handle it.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.160
First-year, you're a slow cleaner.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.260
We can't go home!

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.640
Why are my senpai so bossy,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.720
just because they were born 
a year or two before me?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.570
Don't quit.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.440
You have sharp observation skills, 
and take directions perfectly.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.030
The first and second-years 
know you're awesome.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:09.280
You will definitely make our team strong.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.720
He doesn't stand out.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.250
Huh?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.020
Even a beginner can sense 
Kageyama-kun's amazing presence.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.800
But though Nekoma's setter-kun

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.370
might be doing amazing things, 
but you can't tell.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.140
It's because of their stable receiving.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.390
In developing a diverse offensive, 
it's receiving that's important.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.590
You want receives that cleanly return 
above the setter's head.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.110
Their setter can utilize his talents 
because of the receivers.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.970
For Karasuno, setter Kageyama 
unifies our awkward team

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.570
with his overwhelming talent.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.790
In Nekoma, setter Kozume is supported 
by the entire team's receiving power.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.510
We're like the blood in our veins.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.930
We must flow without stopping.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.260
Keep the oxygen moving

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.180
and your mind working.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.460
One touch!

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.410
Nice cover, Yaku-san.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.810
We have no superhuman ace. 
But all we have to do...

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.730
is modestly, carefully, keep 
scoring one point at a time.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.320
Nekoma          Karasuno

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.320
All right.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.080
Kageyama. I'll slam the 
next one. Give me a toss.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.070
It's their set point.
 If you miss, we'll lose the set.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.620
I know. I'll score.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.330
Nice receive.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.080
But even if we can't clear the 
first round of the game,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.540
As they keep repeating the same move...

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.070
We'll get used to it.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.180
Nekoma          Karasuno

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.390
I got you, at last.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:04.400
All right.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.870
Hey, we can't afford to get discouraged.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.540
We'll take back the next set.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.230
There's no such thing as 
an unstoppable spike.

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.170
Don't think otherwise.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.740
You'll score next time, Hinata.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.780
Wham!

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.580
Yes.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.420
Yikes, again...

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.380
All right.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.320
Nice block, Inuoka!

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.310
It's not dumb luck.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.590
Their #7's getting used
 to Hinata's moves.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.720
Karasuno           Nekoma

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.470
Daichi-san, nice cover.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.580
Left.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.690
Tanaka-san.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.520
You're wondering why I don't 
switch Hinata out, aren't you?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.350
Not really.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.540
If this were an official tournament, I might.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.070
But this is my chance to find a solution.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.170
But if Hinata starts 
to lose his will to fight,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.830
it might be better to let him sit one out.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.410
He

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:06.710
Damn.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.920
It didn't work.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.950
All right.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.900
He was completely shut out of his 
first and last match in junior high.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.600
And in high school, he couldn't 
overcome Tsukishima's height at all.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.230
Regardless, he finally acquired a

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.100
method to fight against opponents 
much taller than him.

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.980
It's Hinata's unique and strongest attack...

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.480
but it was stopped by a single blocker.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.650
The "human wall" that breaks the will.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.140
The more you run into it, 
the more discouraged you feel.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.280
He's smiling.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.760
Hey.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.170
Something's different.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.360
Different from the time when I couldn't see 
the "other side" because of blockers.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.170
I was at complete loss for what to do.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.440
But now it's different.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.470
I can tell they're matching me 
by the skin of their teeth.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.070
I used to be afraid of blocks.
 I hated them.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.570
But when that guy's in front 
of me, I feel excitement.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.320
With your toss, and with 
some kind of strategy,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.960
I'm sure we can break through this wall.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.790
One more time...

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.170
Send me a toss.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.920
That goes without saying.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.800
Karasuno                  Nekoma

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.800
Nice serve.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.520
That toss, did Hinata just...

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.920
He saw it.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.040
He trusted Kageyama
 with the ball all this time!

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.720
All he ever did was give it a full swing...

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.660
T-Time!

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.140
It's not that I didn't 
trust your toss, umm...

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:07.790
I wonder.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.320
What are you panicking about?

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.080
Kageyama.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.840
Give Hinata a softer toss than usual.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.780
Not the usual direct delivery.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:18.940
An indirect delivery?

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:20.260
In...

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.930
Instead of the usual fast toss 
on a straight trajectory,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.960
it's a slightly floating kind of toss.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:30.440
I realize it might be hard to 
suddenly change tack, but...

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:32.380
I'll do it.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.090
Why are you changing the toss?

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.460
To give Hinata an advantage in the air.

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.640
I saw Hinata trying to thwart 
the block while in mid-air.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.160
Huh?

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.700
He probably saw Kageyama's technique

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.090
to thwart a block, and tried to copy it.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.140
He just failed miserably.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.260
I've been spiking without 
thinking all this time...

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.430
Now that I have to coordinate with 
the ball on my own, I don't know how.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.390
Karasuno                  Nekoma

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.210
Time, once more.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.750
Hinata, I want you to relax.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:08.390
Yes.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.290
I'm s-sorry. I've missed so many.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.730
What are you saying?

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.850
It's because of you I get to freely spike.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:20.160
It's okay to have matches in which 
I look cooler than you.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.610
Although Asahi-san's scoring more.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.220
Shut up. Anyway, it's fine.
Right, Asahi-san?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.620
Huh? Oh, right, right.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.080
We'll make up for lost points.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.020
Although you might get switched, 
if you keep blowing it.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.420
Tsukishima.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.910
If you're learning something, 
then give it all you got.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.260
You're alone when you jump,

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.220
but remember that we're all behind you.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.810
Besides, the ace says he'll 
make up for lost points.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.660
Daichi, don't put pressure on Asahi.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.320
What if he gets hurt?

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.800
That's right. His heart is made of glass.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.820
Please stop ganging up on him.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.900
Asahi-san.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.060
Left.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.830
Go.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.370
Nice course.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.830
Karasuno                  Nekoma

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.380
Again, all he can do is hit returns.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.300
What can we do to help him improve?

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:21.010
It's only natural he can't do 
a play he's never done before.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:22.060
Bring it on.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.220
But everything you learn, 
you learn by doing.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.740
Remember Karasuno's Little Giant?

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.180
The ace Hinata-kun idolizes?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.540
He lived up to his name. 
He was only 170 cm tall.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.150
In the beginning, he was constantly blocked.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.860
But in the latter half of his second year,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.610
he was peerless when it 
came to battling mid-air.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.680
He couldn't overcome the blockers' height,

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.370
so he aimed at spaces in between them.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.980
He'd make the ball touch the 
blockers' fingertips on purpose,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.030
and make it ricochet.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.580
That's how he conceived his own 
style of battle as a short player.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.320
I'm just repeating the story
 my granddad told me.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.350
Former Coach Ukai?

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:06.590
Yeah. I remember everything my 
granddad told me really well.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.050
Because people don't have wings...

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.180
We look for ways to fly.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.660
Shucks, that was out.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:35.790
That was awesome.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.370
That was awesome, Shoyo.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.010
One more.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.970

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.310
Your shrimp-chan was quite amazing.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.940
Though his last spike was out.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.900
Oh, no. Your Inuoka-kun
 was even more amazing.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.860
Though he was naturally quite impressed.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.070
Um, I'm kind of scared...

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.010
