WEBVTT

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.680
Miyagi Prefecture
Tokonami High School

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.690
It's official.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.400
I got the pairings for the 
Inter-High preliminaries.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.170
At last.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.470
Where's our first match gonna be?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.360
Let's see...

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.830
Omisaki 
Tokonami
Karasuno
Dateko

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.970
Tori... Torino?

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.050
Torino? Is that a British school?

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.830
It's Karasuno, moron. 
Besides, Torino would be Italian.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.540
Tokonami

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.540
I've heard of that school.
 They're...

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.050
"Fallen rivals. 
Unflying crows."

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.320
What's that? Some kind of idiom?

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.250
They used to be strong.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.840
I think they even went to nationals once.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.220
I hear they're not even 
worth mentioning nowadays.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.760
Which could mean, that just maybe...

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.560
They'll be easy to beat.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.820
We won't lose in the first round 
like we do every year.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.690
But to make that happen, we have to train.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.850
Captain.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.150
Get running.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.110
Yeah.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.290
A guy from my junior high
 volleyball club is at Karasuno.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.470
Is it your first time 
seeing him since then?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.730
We've never played
 against that school before.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.590
He used to talk about how 
unforgettable Karasuno was

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.540
in the spring tournament he saw on TV,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.760
but he probably went there 
because it's close to his home.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.220
I wonder how he's doing now...

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.200
Sawamura.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.980
Haikyu!!

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.150
Episode 14: Formidable Opponents

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.190
Block follow! Get in there!

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.670
Don't just stand and watch.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.440
I'm sorry.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530
"This is my last chance." 
Always tell yourself that.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.690
Give it all you got.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.950
If you don't, the one chance you wasted

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.960
could cost you the match!

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.290
Everyone, you all did a good job 
in today's matches against Nekoma.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.390
Inter-High preliminaries begin 
next month on June 2nd.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.260
There are no district 
preliminaries in Miyagi,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.470
so we go straight to 
prefectural preliminaries.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.940
Championship

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.890
Out of about 60 teams in the prefecture, 
only one will go to nationals.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.940
The winning team

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.940
Lose one match and the journey ends.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.810
If you want to take revenge on Nekoma,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.470
you must take first place in Miyagi. 
There's no other way.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.530
Second place won't cut it.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.860
Of course, they'll have to win the battle
 to represent Tokyo, as well.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.850
Those guys can do it.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.670
Yeah. They're strong.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.790
Another match against Nekoma...

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.190
Again...

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.660
Nice, Hinata.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.420
Get up quickly. One more.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.260
Yes, thank you.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.410
Front, front.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.360
Cover.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.520
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Club

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.400
You're right. That's amazing.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.870
The picture's huge.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:53.490
Yeah!

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.640
What, what?

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.490
What? What's that?

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.570
Look.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.750
Boy's High School
This year, pay special attention to these three 
<font size="40">GUYS!</c>

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.370
"Shiratorizawa's Ushiwaka is among the 
three most-noticed high schoolers

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.750
in the whole country."

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.290
Shiratorizawa! That's where 
Kageyama couldn't get in.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.840
Shut up.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.100
What's so funny, you bastards?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.290
Who's Ushiwaka?

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.360
We're not laughing.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.070
You don't know?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.770
You're full of it.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.910
That's because you're only 
a fan of the Little Giant.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.470
Let me tell you about Ushiwaka.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.270
He's unmistakably the number-one ace 
of our prefecture: Ushijima Wakatoshi.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
Overwhelming power and height!!
Super high-school ace!!

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
Miyagi

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
Shiratorizawa Academy

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
Third-year
Ushijima Wakatoshi

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.640
His goal: To conquer nationals, of course!

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.470
Hmm. He definitely has "ace" 
written all over him.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.860
Hey, why are you looking at me?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.810
Kageyama, you were trying to get 
into a place with guys like this?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.480
And you were going to yell 
at the super high-school ace,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.350
"Move faster, clumsy oaf!" and stuff, right?

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.330
I wouldn't say that.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.160
Monthly <c.colorcd2049>Volleyball</c>

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.160
If we don't defeat him,
 we can't play against Nekoma.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.040
Hey, hey.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.530
Shiratorizawa isn't the 
only formidable opponent.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.760
Would the others be last year's best four?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.960
Yes, but there are other 
formidable opponents this year.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.430
Wakutani Minami

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.430
There's Wakutani Minami, which has
 superior defense and coordination.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.150
Date Kogyo

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.340
Date Kogyo is also known as
 the Iron Wall, which says it all.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.150
That team has the highest 
blocking rate in the country.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.290
If I recall,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.610
we lost to Dateko 2-0 in the
 prefectural tournament last March.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.620
The match in March... 
an iron wall of blockers...

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.370
Every single spike by Asahi got 
blocked in this one match.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.680
Was Suga-san talking about 
the match against Date Kogyo?

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.710
I hear there's a second-year named 
Aone who is particularly dangerous.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.920
Dateko is as strong as
 the other best four teams,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.490
but they lost their third-round match against
 the eventual champions, Shiratorizawa,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.310
and only made the best sixteen.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.130
That's why they weren't seeded this year.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.050
In other words, depending on the match-ups,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.050
we might or might not play 
against them in the first round.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.510
And the next one... Oh, yeah.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.610
I heard we recently had a 
practice match against them.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.000
The team's top attacker is their setter, 
and of course he's also a supreme setter.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.580
Their team's ranks include perhaps the best 
all-around player in the prefecture.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.540
Aoba Johsai

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.540
That would Oikawa Toru at Aoba Johsai.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.500
The Great King!

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.210
They were in last year's best four.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.680
Last, but not least...

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.630
Shiratorizawa

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.640
The defending champions, Shiratorizawa, 
and their super-ace Ushijima Wakatoshi.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.480
That about sums it up.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.030
I'll save the details for later.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.020
Ukai-san, even though you're sloppy...

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.610
You guys are thinking something 
disrespectful about me, aren't you?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.580
Anyway, those are the top four
 contenders this year.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.830
However, if look up instead of straight ahead,
 we could lose our footing.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.000
There's no team that enters 
a tournament to lose.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.460
They all enter to win.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.920
While we frantically train,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.880
others will also be frantically training.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.560
Weak or strong, they're all aiming to win.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.430
Don't forget that.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.280
And...

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.990
don't let them call us
 "unflying crows" ever again.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.230
Yeah.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.500
I'm glad you're all still here.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.270
Sorry I'm late.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.330
The meeting went long. However...

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.120
Here it is. The match-ups for 
the Inter-High preliminaries.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:41.670
Tokonami (4)
 
 
Karasuno (5)
 
 
Dateko (6)
 
 
 Ouka (7)

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.740
If we win the first round,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.670
we might play against Dateko, 
assuming they also win.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.050
But that's not all...

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.340
<font size="20">Aoba Johsai (1)
 
 Senkawa Kita (2)
 
 Omisaki (3)
 
 Okonami (4)
 
Karasuno (5)
 
 Dateko (6)
 
 Ouka (7)</c>

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.320
Aoba Johsai is one of the seeds in our block.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.340
Day One                         Day Two

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.340
For real?

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.300
Dateko and Seijoh...

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.290
Hey.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.520
Don't forget what I just said.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.440
If all you do is look up...

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.780
We know.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.480
Tokonami 
Karasuno

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.690
Which high school are 
you going to, Sawamura?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.570
Karasuno.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.330
Huh? Where?

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.230
You know, the school that was 
in the spring tournaments.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.990
Oh.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.940
And you, Ikejiri?

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.410
I'm going to Tokonami.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.670
Guess we're parting ways.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.880
Guess so.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.980
Which means,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.100
if I continue playing 
volleyball in high school...

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.030
You should continue.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.170
Maybe we'll play against each other.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.130
And if we do, I'll smash you to pieces.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.310
Tokonami
Karasuno

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.750
I dare you.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.950
Ikejiri, let's get going.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.440
The first round match...

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.490
I promise we'll win it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.460
Third-Year  Class 4

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.920
Sawamura.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.380
What, Michimiya?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.990
I got the pep rally schedule
for the sports clubs.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.400
The volleyball club is up fifth.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.550
Thank you.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.150
Do you have a speech ready, captain?

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.210
Nope, I've got nothing.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.480
The Inter-High preliminaries 
are around the corner.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.180
Yeah. The boys' team is doing well.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.360
What was that team... the one you used 
to do practice matches with...

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.530
Excuse me.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:34.420
Nekoma?

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.570
Right, right. You played 
against them again, right?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.620
How are the girls doing?

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.340
I've been out of touch because 
we have separate gyms.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.670
We've been... well... as usual.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.820
The club members stopped coming 
to morning practice, as usual.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.750
I'm not good at being stern.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.490
We'll probably lose in 
the first round, again.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.760
Crap.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.750
Michimiya, didn't you say,
 "We'll definitely win next time"?

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.600
No matter how formidable and 
unbeatable your opponent,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.490
you'll never win if you don't
 believe you can.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.010
Whoops, I didn't mean to preach. 
Well, you see...

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:23.040
I remember when you scolded me in 
junior high. You said the same thing.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.720
It was right after we got crushed
 in a practice match before the tournament.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.410
I figured we were destined 
for failure in the real tournament.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.680
Even if we're not confident that we'll win,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.180
even if others tell us 
we don't stand a chance, we...

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.010
"We must never tell ourselves that."

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.640
End quote.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.750
I'm sorry! I have a bad habit of 
losing confidence before a tournament.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.790
I hope I'm not being presumptuous,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.690
but since you and I are both captains,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.200
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.040
You're too easy on me.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.290
All right, I'm good.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.500
I'm good now. Thanks.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.770
Because I...

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.850
want to pulverize my dear underclassman,
 setter-on-setter, in an official match.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.360
What's that?

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.270
Scary.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.030
Third-Year  Class 3

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.740
Karasuno (5)
Dateko (6)

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.120
Dateko       Karasuno

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.080
Asahi-san.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.040
Go! Club!

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.840
What's going on?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.510
Is he training a dog?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.470
Nishinoya.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.180
Don't worry about me.
I'm not running away.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.830
I know everyone's behind me.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.000
This time, I'll stick out my chest,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.440
and declare, "I'm the ace of Karasuno!"

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.390
Hinata.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:20.830
Sugawara-san.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.280
Perfect timing. There's something 
I wanted to give you.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.660
I'll give it to the other first years later.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:28.620
My signals.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.650
I'm not as accurate as Kageyama,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.880
so I'll give signals to say, 
"This is what I'm doing next."

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.840
Oh.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.440
Though you might not like 
memorizing things...

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.480
I don't mind. Signals are cool.
I'll memorize them.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.620
We have to use them in practice,
 or they'll be useless in the tournament.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.360
I'd be grateful if you could 
practice them with me.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.860
Yes. I'll do it all you want.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.730
I'll learn to spike any toss.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.170
A back attack with three 
vanguards feinting...

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.170
Keishin-chan.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.180
Keishin-chan, dear, I need some mirin.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.880
Sorry.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.590
Foothill Store

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.590
Keishin-chan, dear, I need some mirin.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.560
What are you looking all serious about?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.280
The tournament's coming up, right?

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.170
Yeah.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.840
Tournaments fire you up, don't they? 
It's like getting ready for battle.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.570
Yeah... sort of.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.570
And then maybe, your cute 
girlfriend comes to watch, and...

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.500
"Tomorrow's the tournament at last."

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.990
"Yeah, that's right."

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.020
"You were training so long for this."

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.580
"Yeah. I know it's been hard for you, too."

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.690
"No, I don't mind."

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.950
"I love watching you play, Ryu-kun."

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.290
"Honey..."

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.180
"I thought hard about what to give you, 
and I made this for you."

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.010
"A good luck charm..."

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.360
"Ryu-kun. Do your best tomorrow."

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.220
If she said stuff like that to me...

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.740
I was thinking I'd get even more fired up.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.790
Keep thinking that, and I'll 
take your place as a regular.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.950
Nice kill.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:27.950
Nice, Azumane-san.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.120
Azumane.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.040
Yes.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.380
Are you good at back attacks?

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.330
Hey. I need you guys here.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.000
That's the idea...

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.580
We have to find the right 
height for spiking.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.030
It looks hard.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.970
Let's do it.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.510
Coach us.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.420
Hinata, you jump in as usual.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.270
Yes.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.750
Good job.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.940
Good job.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.400
Ukai-kun, you must be exhausted.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.200
I appreciate you coming 
daily at start time, but

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.240
I hope it's not affecting your job.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.870
Yeah, I've been working at the 
store exclusively 'til now,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.060
but now I'm working on the farm as well,

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.820
so I've been working the 
evening shift at the store.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.050
It's our family business, 
so I can't complain.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.350
Thank you very much.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.990
I'll bring you sake or something 
the next time I visit.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.010
Seriously?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.830
I didn't realize there were 
so many attack patterns.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.490
Are we using all of these?

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.480
It depends.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.690
I need those guys to focus on the match.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.210
Hinata, A next.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.190
Yes.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:46.310
I can't overwhelm them before the match.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.780
Nice, Hinata. Awesome, awesome.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.160
Hinata and Sugawara's 
quicks are taking shape.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.160
Thanks!

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.870
That toss was really good.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.580
Nice.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.960
Azumane-san, how was that toss? 
Was it too high? Too low?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.080
How was it?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.750
Oh, um... yeah, it was fine.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.720
If you have a criticism, no matter 
how minor, tell me everything.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720
I'll fix it.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.650
I see... then... maybe a little higher?

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.600
And a little further away from the net.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.270
Understood.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.080
Ten more spikes, please.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.730
What?

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.180
Is that not enough? Then twenty spikes.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.440
There's no point in getting 
that anxious before the match.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.440
No, that's not what I meant...

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.170
Remember the timing 
when you start running.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:28.900
Yes.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.360
Did you mean you want to 
practice other patterns?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.740
Hey, stragglers. Let's wrap it up.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.330
Right.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.040
Shimizu.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.500
Daichi says he's buying us pork buns.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.290
Sorry. I have stuff to do.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.220
I see. Good job.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.220
Good job.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.200
One per person.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.060
Thanks.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.380
Thank you.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.810
Daichi-san, thank you.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.160
Let's eat and then go home.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.550
Hey, Tsukishima.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.080
Daichi-san bought us pork buns.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.410
Oh, thanks.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.900
Isn't Yamaguchi with you?

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.240
He said he has stuff to do.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.200
Shimada Mart

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.170
He left before I did.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.410
Sorry, we're closed. Oh?

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.630
I'm in the Karasuno Volleyball Club.  
My name is Yamaguchi.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.940
I knew you looked familiar.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.630
Um...

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.880
Will you teach me how
 to do a jump float serve?

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.020
Oh, yeah. I used it in that match.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.260
But the Inter-High preliminaries 
start soon, right?

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.270
It'll be hard to learn it in such short time.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.330
Probably.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.860
I probably won't be able to 
play this time around, anyway.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.420
There's no way a first-year like
 me can replace a third-year.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.870
But...

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:05.490
I don't want to be the only 
first-year who has to sit out.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.050
Tsukishima

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.230
All School Sports Clubs Pep Rally

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.030
Miyagi Prefecture Tokonami High School

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.270
Inter-High

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.270
Good job.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.630
Go home and go to sleep early tonight.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.700
Yeah.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.700
Okay, that'll do it.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.440
Just a second.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.150
One more thing. Shimizu-san?

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.290
I'm not good at cheering, but...

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.090
Sensei, if you will?

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.480
Leave it to me.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.590
Sensei, I can do the carrying.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:15.820
Don't worry about it.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.320
What's going on?

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.140
One, two...

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.180
Fly

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.870
Fly

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.050
I didn't know we had that.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.320
I found it while cleaning, so I washed it.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.530
I'm getting fired up!

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.280
That's our Kiyoko-san! Great job!

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.880
All right! Let's get fired up!

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.880
Wait.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.580
She's...

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.450
...not done.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:51.960
Do...

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.420
"Do"?

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.770
Do your best.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.290
Fly

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.400
Shimizu!

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.860
No one ever did
 anything like this for us before!

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:22.700
Even the captain?

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.040
Those guys... they're speechless.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.910
They usually never shut up.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.910
You're all out of control.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.790
We're going to win the first round for sure!

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:37.540
Yeah.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.260
We have the strength of a hundred men!

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.700
First one here! First one here!

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.340
You bastard! Stop, Kageyama.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:16.020
That makes 31 wins and 30 losses for me.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.590
And one draw.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:20.890
That's not right.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.520
It is right. I won.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.800
I've won 30 times, 
and that was my 32nd loss.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.150
Around this time last year, 
you defeated my team.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.190
We got crushed.

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:43.070
Yukigaoka               Kitagawa Daiichi

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.670
If you're the king that rules the court...

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.210
"I'll have to defeat you, and 
I'll be the last one standing."

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.990
I promise I'll defeat you.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.500
Even if takes me ten years, 
or twenty years, I will.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.790
You plan on playing on the 
same level as me, then.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.770
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.230
Even if I'm the best in Japan, 
or the whole world?

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.190
The whole world?

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.550
O-Of course.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.870
And don't call me "King."

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.870
Ouch.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.410
Ouch...

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.080
Let's go. Today we take our 
first step toward that goal.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.810
Yeah.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.930
Tanaka-senpai, why are you crying?

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.910
Kiyoko-san said, "Do your best."

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.970
But that was yesterday.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.090
Ryu, don't remind me!

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:25.730
"I don't get you guys...
