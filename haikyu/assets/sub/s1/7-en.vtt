WEBVTT

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.980
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.610
Oikawa, you're back.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.570
How's the ankle?

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.730
It's fine. I can get back 
to regular practice.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.280
It was just a slight sprain.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.310
For crying out loud! Be careful.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.950
You're the one that asked 
to play against Kageyama.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.040
What do we do without our official setter?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.940
It's embarrassing.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm sorry.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.360
Oikawa-san, take care of yourself!

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.700
Kageyama-kun, who's that laid-back guy?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.430
I find him unpleasant.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.830
He's the captain of Seijoh.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.390
Oikawa-san is a super-aggressive setter.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.980
His attack power is also 
at the top of his team.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.290
Even Kageyama acknowledges 
that player's abilities...

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.100
And he's got a terrible personality.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.330
Coming from you, that's scary...

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.290
Maybe even worse than Tsukishima.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.770
He must be really bad.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.920
Do you know him from Kitagawa Daiichi?

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.460
Yes.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.810
He was my senpai in junior high.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.380
A senpai of the King. 
That would make him...

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.240
The Great King.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.080
Yoo-hoo! Long time no see, Tobio-chan.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.080
Haikyu!!

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.230
Long time no see, Tobio-chan.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.570
Episode 7:  Versus the Great King

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.480
So nice to see you.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.830
You still doing the King thing?

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.190
I learned serving and blocking 
by watching him play.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760
His skills are extremely high.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.660
He taught him those killer serves?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.690
But we have to focus on the match now.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.340
We're going to win the final set for sure.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.160
Y-Yeah.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.170
Tanaka-san, please stop
 with the intimidation.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.210
Anyway, go get warmed up.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.020
Even more than usual.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.050
Yes.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.970
I'm crushing him. I'm serious.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.430
Aoba Johsai              Karasuno

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.180
When's Oikawa-san going to play?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.890
Idiot. He has to warm up 
or he could get hurt.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.930
That wouldn't be good!

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.750
Here, here, here.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.030
Aoba Johsai              Karasuno

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.740
One more point.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.450
Only one more point...

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.910
and we will beat Seijoh, rated in 
the top four in the prefecture.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.000
Don't get cocky!

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.550
Kindaichi, nice.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.050
Don't mind, Tsukishima.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.100
Oh my. We're in a crisis.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.470
Did you get warmed up?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.680
Perfectly.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.460
Leave the rest to your senpai.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.260
Yes.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.280
He's here! The Great King!

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.110
Stop that.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.420
Does that mean we're switching setters?

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.990
No, I think he's a pinch-server.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.990
Oikawa, nice serve.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.200
No matter how strong your offense is...

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.210
It means nothing if you can't connect to it.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.670
What?

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.930
He aimed it at Tsukishima.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.810
Tsukki.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.310
Just as I thought. 
I watched part of the match...

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.080
You, number 6, and you, number 5.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.120
You're not good receivers, are you?

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.150
You must be first-years.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.900
Like Kageyama... 
No, even more powerful than him.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.580
His ball control allows him 
 to hit it anywhere he wants.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.940
So this is the captain of Seijoh.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.290
Okay, let's score another one.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.300
Tsukki!

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.850
Damn.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.260
Don't mind, Tsukishima.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.310
Tsukishima is always mean.
 I hate him.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.030
But this time...

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.390 line:50 %
Aoba Johsai          Karasuno

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.390
Oh. One more point and we're tied.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.850
Hey. You, Great King.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.560
Aim at me. I'll receive it. Aim here.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.320
"Great King"?

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.490
Stop raising a fuss. It's embarrassing.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.570
What did you say?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.200
We're in real trouble, 
and he still irritates me.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.080
But... but...

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.880
Listen.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.580
In volleyball,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.580
In volleyball,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.790
everyone on this side 
of the net is your ally.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.750
What a beautiful adage.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.810
All right. All of you scoot to the back.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.070
Tsukishima, you go closer to the sideline.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.800
Yes.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.340
All right. Bring it.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.300
Hmm.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.730
Net

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.040
So Captain-kun, expert at receiving,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.730
is expanding the defense...

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.500
However...

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.290
you can't defend it all by yourself.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.370
Tsukki!

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.670
He's aimed it directly at the edge.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.820
But he sacrficed some of his power
to get that accuracy.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.150
It went up.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.450
Tsukki, nice.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.740
He got it. Good for him.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.490
Maybe I made it too easy for him.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.160
However...

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.870
This is our chance ball.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.130
Damn.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.460
There. A sweet, sweet chance ball.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.300
Score it good, guys.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.260
All right.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.260
This is bad.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.930
Our rotation has no height for blocking.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.580
Kindaichi.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.600
All right, I'll completely thwart the block...

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.530
The shrimp... how is he here?

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.320
It's up.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.080
Nice one-touch.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.220
Chance ball.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.900
Damn! I'll slam it down the next time.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.280
I can't catch up to him if I'm 
one step, one second behind.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.240
The only thing that can catch up to him...

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.580
is the ball.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.770
Aoba Johsai          Karasuno

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:45.240
What was that?

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.630
He came from the other end 
of the court, in a flash.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.240
That toss was like it got sucked 
into the spiker's hand.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.770
Wow...

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.410
All right.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.250
Line up.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.290
What's the matter?

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.620
That was amazing.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.100
Oh, right.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.000
Today is your first time seeing 
Hinata and Kageyama's attack.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.390
Aren't they amazing? 
I mean amazing, even scary.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.780
Please coach us.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.500
Sensei, maybe give a critique or something.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.800
O-Oh, I see.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.130
Um... I'm just a beginner when 
it comes to volleyball, but...

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.230
But even I can tell, that something 
amazing is going on here.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.740
We have some amazing 
first-years this semester.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.990
They were hard to handle in the beginning,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.480
but I learned something today.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.290
We're nothing if don't cooperate.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.500
A chemical synergy happens when 
each one encounters the other...

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.480
Even this very moment is giving birth

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.030
to other encounters 
that will change the world.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.510
Maybe in some far, remote country.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.630
Maybe on the other side of the planet.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.760
Or maybe at an ordinary volleyball club, 
at an ordinary high school,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.430
in a northern countryside
 on a small island in the east.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.130
I think that encounters like that
happened to Karasuno today.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.710
I know I can't prove what I say, 
but it's better than not believing.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.250
All of you will most likely 
become stronger. Much stronger!

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.550
Sorry! That was a little too poetic!

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.310
Are you turned off?

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.130
No, no, no, of course not.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.380
Thank you.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.590
Thank you.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.400
Oh, y-yeah.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.350
Kindaichi.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.820
All of us have had enough of him.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:03.330
Sure he's got individual attack power, 
but he's clearly impeding the team.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.500
Kitagawa
Daiichi

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.500 position:20%
Kitagawa
Daiichi

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.030
To be frank, 
we're better off without him.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.510
Don't apologize!

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.020
Because I won't apologize, either.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.940
Yeah.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.830
You're still an oppressive king,
 as far as I'm concerned.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.280
You're irritating, and there's no one
 I want to crush more than you.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.230
Yeah.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.900
So don't apologize.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:32.830
Yeah.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.310
I'm not reconciling with you.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.240
We weren't friends in the first place.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.030
Yeah.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.590
And the next time, we'll win for sure.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.320
The next time...

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.130
Toilet, toilet, toilet...

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.820
Who am I?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.450
The guy who'll become the ace.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.600
Oh crap. There's bad blood 
between those two.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.580
This vibe tells me I should stay back.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:03.640
Kindaichi.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.100
The next time we battle, we will win again.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.430
What were you guys talking about?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.240
He... said "we."

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:22.210
Did you cry?

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.240
He used to always say "I" like 
he was the only one playing.

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.170
Of course I didn't cry, idiot. 
Now go use the toilet.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.240
You can't fool me, Kageyama-kun.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.440
Hinata, you dumbass.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.170
Damn...

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.260
I kind of feel defeated.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.670
Wh-What was that for?

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.630
Thank you very much.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.600
Takeda-sensei complimented us,

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.840
but frankly, if we were facing 
Seijoh and Oikawa in an all-out match,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.520
we'd be lacking.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.230
Spoken like a true captain.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.900
You know your stuff.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.820
The Great King makes his entrance.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.360
You got a problem, dude?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.210
What do you want?

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.120
Wanna fight, huh?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.290
Wanna fight, huh?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.540
Don't be so hostile.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.010
You, little one.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.920
Huh?

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.050
Your last one-touch and 
broad attack were amazing.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.010
Oh...

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.470
Let's give it all we got the next time,
 right from the start.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.930
You didn't get to see our set up.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.960
Oh, yes, and we'll be 
improving our serves, too.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.600
That's true.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.440
Those serves would come 
continuously from the start.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.360
It's true, your offense was amazing,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.950
but your receives are slow.
You'll reach your limit very quickly.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.660
I'm not the only one who 
hits powerful serves.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.320
The Inter-High preliminaries 
are coming up soon.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.720
Don't get eliminated, okay?

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.330
Because I...

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.550
want to pulverize my dear underclassman,
 setter-on-setter, in an official match.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.390
The receivers will train.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.260
Hey, let go.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.020
Receivers don't improve overnight.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.190
Ask the captain. He should know.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.020
There's not much time left 
'til the tournament.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.190
I look forward to seeing you there.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.940
Don't let him get to you.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.400
He likes to razz people like that.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.950
It's true. We don't have much time 
before the Inter-High preliminaries,

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.580
but <i>he</i> should be coming back soon.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.090
Who's coming back soon?

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.010
The guardian deity of Karasuno.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.740
Kageyama has become more amazing.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.600
Yeah. That genius was spinning his wheels,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.280
but finally found his best destination.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.830
No commoner could a hold 
a candle to him now.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.390
Yeah? You're no match for him either, huh?

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.390
When it comes to the toss.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.380
There's probably no one in the prefecture 
who could match Tobio's toss.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.510
But he's not better than me at 
serving, blocking, or spiking.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.760
Ouch.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.890
Damn it, Oikawa!
Don't say his toss is better than yours!

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.710
You're a setter, aren't you?

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.680
But I'm only being honest.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.170
That's why we have to break their receivers.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.070
Because no matter how 
amazing his tosses are,

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.830
if the ball doesn't get to the 
setter, it's all for nothing.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.900
If we can play against Karasuno 
in the official tournament,

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.060
we can make a mess out of their receives,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.630
and not even give them a chance at a toss.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.170
Just having one good player
 doesn't mean your team will win.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.820
How I want to say "don't mind" to them.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.360
How I want to say it.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.790
What? Geniuses get irked by stuff like that.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.750
I get more irked by guys 
who get cheered on by girls.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.400
You shouldn't be jealous Iwa-chan. 
It's embarrassing.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.720
Hey, quit fooling around.
Coach'll get mad.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.340
All right, let's clean up quickly.
 Then we're done.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.430
Good job today.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.930
Good job.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.890
Hey.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.670
Sensei, thank you for everything today.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.850
No, no, everyone did a good job.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.280
I'm shocked by how we beat 
Aoba Johsai High School.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.480
But we're still lacking.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.200
Our offense is effective now due 
to Hinata and Kageyama's dynamics,

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.850
but if Hinata gets in the way of the blocks,

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:36.700
Hinata, that's enough mopping. Go home.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.670
or if the receives get broken 
like they did today,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.750
Look at that, Tsukki.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.160
we would definitely find 
ourselves at a loss.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.160
Amazing.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:46.240
And when that happens, 
I don't know if I can guide the team

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.660
as a director or coach could.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.650
I see...

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:52.850
I apologize. I'm not saying 
that you're not good enough.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.010
I know, I know.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.380
I'll take care of finding a coach.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.410
I have a lead.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.640
Oh? Really? Who is it?

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.110
Foothill Store

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.700
I've been asking repeatedly, and 
haven't got an affirmative yet,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.370
but I will definitely make it happen.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.960
Can I leave the rest to you for today?

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.070
Oh, yes.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.020
Take-chan has an air of 
confidence about him.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.780
Yeah.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.080
Equipment room

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:20.930
What's this?

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.090
This mop looks dangerous. 
Can I throw it away?

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.790
Oh, don't worry about that. It's all right.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.840
We can fix it, and still use it.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.500
Huh?

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.050
Good job, everyone.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.220
Good job.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.930
Foothill Store

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.930
Chinese dumplings?

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:46.150
We have Karasuno 
High School 
Hallway slippers

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.260
The soccer club bought up the last of it.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.150
Besides, we're closing for today.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.980
I'm starving.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.210
What a lazy clerk!

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.020
Shut up. Go home and eat a proper meal.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.650
You won't get muscles if you don't.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.540
Here.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.240
Thanks.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.690
Eat a proper meal.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.480
Hooray~

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.020
Yes, yes.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.750
Hello, Foothill Store.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.470
You again?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.600
But I gotta say...

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.660
Laid-Back sure has an amazing serve.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.410
We would've been in trouble 
if he'd played from the start.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.060
He's Kageyama's junior high 
senpai, after all...

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.480
Wait a second. Why are you 
at Karasuno, Kageyama?

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.640
The strongest school in the 
prefecture is Shiratorizawa.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.710
Shiratori?

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.580
Shiratorizawa. 
They're top in the prefecture.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.380
They're a powerhouse school ranked 
among the top eight in the country.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.210
Oh.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.170
I didn't make Shiratorizawa.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:52.170
You didn't make it?

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:56.820
I never got a recommendation from them, 
so I took a general entrance exam.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.560
I don't know what 
the meaning of that exam was.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.180
That school is super hard to 
get into by conventional means.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.100
I guess the King isn't very good at studies.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.600
See ya.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.790
But why did you come to Karasuno?

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.570
Are you an admirer of the Little Giant, too?

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:15.540
I heard Director Ukai is 
coming out of retirement.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:16.900
Ukai?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.020
An outstanding coach who took unknown 
Karasuno to the spring nationals!

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.870
Wow.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.290
The name "Ukai of Karasuno" is famous.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.630
They called him the director 
in charge of vicious ravens.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.320
Second and third-years got 
some coaching from him.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.840
He was pretty Spartan.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.720
Why do you look so envious?

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.690
Director Ukai was going to officially 
come out of retirement, but...

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.990
He was hospitalized?

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.680
There's no information about 
his recovery prospects. Sorry...

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.470
But I figured, no matter 
what school I attended,

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.630
I'd be up against high 
school students like me.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.150
There's no reason why I couldn't win.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.190
Cut the sour grapes.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.110
You can act cool about it, 
but you failed just the same.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.230
That's not true. 
I'm not acting cool about it.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.220
We did defeat a top four 
team today, didn't we?

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.250
True, 2-1 against Seijoh.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.690
I was able to score one free, too,
 thanks to Hinata's decoy.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.830
Thanks.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.340
But how was your 
debut battle for you?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.460
You really went crazy in that first set.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.190
You scored as many points as you lost, 
so don't get complacent.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.280
Why must you say things like that?

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:38.990
That's right.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.150
We're lacking in a lot of ways.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.700
Today's victory was by 
the skin of our teeth.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.780
I-I will train a lot!

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.910
Oh, yeah. Individual level-upping 
is important, too.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.230
But Karasuno, as it currently stands, 
is fundamentally short of members.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.130
That's true.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.240
We need a libero, especially for defense.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.840
And we need an ace spiker who can 
battle three blockers all by himself.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.170
A-Ace? That can be me.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.790
I told you, you're the best decoy.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.550
But didn't you say the
 "guardian god" is coming back?

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.370
Yeah.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.270
We're not powerful, but we're 
not particularly weak, either.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.880
We had outstanding players in the past, too.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.230
We were never able to apply 
their strengths effectively.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.620
But if all of us unite,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.790
and we also have new strength 
coming from our first-years,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.360
if we're able to connect all 
those strengths together...

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.670
we could definitely win...

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.500
...the Summer Inter-High
 National Tournament.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.930
It's not just a distant goal.
It can really happen.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.970
The Summer Inter-High Tournament. 
I've heard about it.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.600
But that person who's coming back...
where has he been all this time?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.500
He was suspended for one week,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.560
and banned for a month from club activities.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.470
A delinquent? He's a delinquent?

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.740
No... he just gets too fired up.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.460
He's a good guy, for real.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.730
If Tanaka-san says he gets "too fired up," 
how extreme could this guy be?

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.200
And not only that, he is...

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.430
a player we could say is 
Karasuno's unique genius.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.500
But not unique any more, 
because now we also have

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.680
cocky-as-crap Kageyama with us.

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:25.660
Call him "senpai" when he comes back, Hinata.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.540
You'll make him gleeful 
like an idiot, like Tanaka.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:29.890
Like an idiot?

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.930
"Guardian god"... I wonder what he's like.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:37.490
Hey, we're leaving you behind.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.470
Oh. Yes.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.250
It's going to hit.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.200
Hey, get out of the way, 
dumbass Hinata!

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.920
That could've hit.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.470
I got it. I got it.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.200
You didn't get it, dumbass. 
You hit a home run.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.890
I'll go get it.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.000
Idiot.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.270
I got it this time.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.650
Match for 
a Thousand

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.010
He perfectly stopped 
the momentum and rotation,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.580
and accurately sent the ball
 back to the setter.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.530
That was a perfect receive.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.780
Y-You're... shorter than me!

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.470
Next Episode Preview

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.020
What? What? What was that? 
He came out of nowhere!

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.260
His receive was solid. The return floated.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.440
That was kind of intense.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.060
Well, it's not that we can't communicate...

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.020
