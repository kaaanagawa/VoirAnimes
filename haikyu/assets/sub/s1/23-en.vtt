WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Chance ball!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Left!

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.480
The final set...

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.990
Win! Then win some more!

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.330
If we lose this...

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.000
It'll be over.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.050
Haikyu!!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.960
Episode 23: The Point that Changes the Momentum

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.750
Nice receive!

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.840
#10!

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.700
They've probably changed to different 
signs for their god-like quicks.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.560
Because they're such simple signs, 
it would be pretty easy to change them.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.320
Still, there's got to be a 
way to tell them apart.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.220
Maybe when they keep their eye on
the ball longer, it's a normal quick,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.080
and when they just go for it, 
it'll be the god-like quick?

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.780
In general, it's probably best 
if we keep our eyes on #10.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.680
Right.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.850
#10...

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.510
But, in the end, the shrimp 
is just efficient decoy.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.000
Don't forget that. Okay?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.910
Right!

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.940
Right!

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:32.940
All right!

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.340
We can't get the shot that will end this.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130
This rally is going on forever.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.060
Overall, Seijoh's better 
at everything, but...

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.640
A feint!

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.480
...their libero has far 
better defensive skills.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.310
All right!

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.900
Asahi-san!

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.830
The setter received that?!

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.360
Now he can't toss!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.170
He'll have to attack now.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.570
Probably to the left.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.030
Watacchi!

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.990
Right!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.170
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.890
All right!

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.170
I've been wondering this, but...

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.260
Hm?

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.580
I think Seijoh's libero

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.630
was formerly a setter.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.140
What do you mean?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.140
Thanks!

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.680
If the libero lifts the ball 
from in front of the attack line,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.540
it's illegal to do an overhand 
spike from behind the line.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980
Just now, that libero jumped 
up at the very edge of the line

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.570
and set while in midair.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.360
Which means, a spike was totally fine.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.610
They can use high-level attacks.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.730
This is why they call
 Aoba Johsai a powerhouse.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.690
All right!

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.210
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.290
Asahi-san!

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.210
The ball's going back!

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.920
I'll push it over!

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.640
All right!

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.560
He did a toss that close to the edge...

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.320
Awesome.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.570
All right! You're all fighting well!

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.560
Keep cool!

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.200
Right!

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.070
It looks like they're getting used 
to attacks that cut into the middle,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.150
so use the sides of the 
court as much as you can!

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.120
Right!

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.840
What's with the lack of 
holes in Seijoh's attacks?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.220
No matter what situation they're put in,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.050
they're able to counter with powerful 
attacks, like it's nothing.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.270
Let's go!

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.300
Right!

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.540
Because Sugawara went in once,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.640
Karasuno was definitely able 
to pick itself back up.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.640
Now they're not nervous or overly aggressive.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.900
Right now, everyone's probably using 
their current strength to the fullest.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.800
That might be exactly why

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.400
we're seeing the difference 
in their strength as a team.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.320
Aoba Johsai                  Karasuno

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.030
Damn it...

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.740
Nice, Tsukishima!

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.330
You keep showing up with that annoying 
feint when everyone's forgotten about it.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.250
Phrasing...

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.810
With every player performing 
at 100% of their ability,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.140
Come on! Talk more!

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.530
Keep it up!

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.210
Seijoh is probably the stronger team.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.680
But sometimes they'll only use 70% 
and then bounce up to 120% of their ability.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.620
That's how things can play out 
during a match, right?

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.440
And Karasuno has the ultimate decoy 
who can let everyone attack at 120% of their ability.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.200
Awesome. Awesome. Seijoh's awesome!

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.390
Out. Out! I want to hurry and get out.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.780
I want to hurry and go out. Out! Out!

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.260
Hinata.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.000
Yes?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.370
Do you remember what Ukai-san said?

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.450
About attacking both sides of the 
court as much as possible?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.420
Right. <i>That's</i> the best attack.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.460
We haven't used <i>that</i> much this time around.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.400
Yes!

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.180
This sucks.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.040
Aoba Johsai                      Karasuno

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.060
Our team is settling into a rhythm, and yet

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.390
if that little sucky guy 
enters the court...

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.850
I can't help but be uneasy about that.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.280
A small beast that's gathered its 
frustrations while in the warm up zone.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.690
Karasuno is fighting back in the final set,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.560
One more!

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.920
Go! One more!

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.710
Go, Shoyo!

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.990
yet we don't stand a chance against Seijoh.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.160
If we're going to get even 
one step ahead of them,

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.660
it'll be up to them.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.170
Give Karasuno that one step!

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.520
Nice receive!

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.220
Left! Left!

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.060
Two blocks!

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.550
Kageyama, nice one-touch!

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:52.930
Chance ball!

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.810
"The sides of the court

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.520
as much as possible."

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.520
Here it is!

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.400
The attack that seems to 
rip through the air:

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.230
that broad cross!

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.320
Rule the Court

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.540
Nice shot, Hinata!

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.470
Crap.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.170
We can't let those two stay
 on the court too long

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.070
after they've gotten fired up.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.590
Makki, nice!

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.300
All right!

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.760
Bring it around, bring it around!

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.260
Hurry and bring the rotation around.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:38.720
Bring the shrimp

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.530
one step closer to the back line!

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.390
Got it!

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.490
The ball's not coming down. So amazing.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:47.900
Nice cover, Makki!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.130
It's coming back!

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.090
Chance ball!

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.950
Fly

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.160
Again?!

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.950
"The sides of the court

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.370
as much as possible."

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.410
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.980
All right!

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.740
That little guy's amazing.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.970
Volleyball, more than anything,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.430
is a sport where you keep 
jumping continuously,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.840
so I believe it's also a battle with gravity.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.300
Jumping as decoy,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:13.760
jumping to block,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.110
and jumping to spike.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.010
Nishinoya, nice cover!

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.180
As the rally keeps going,

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.910
Go back! Go back!
One more! One more!

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.950
fatigue sets in and your mental faculties decline.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:23.970
Left, left!

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.520
We're gonna stop them one more time!

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.900
To be honest, you want 
to skip the blocking,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.080
and I've had times where I hoped 
someone else would spike it.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.160
When long rallies continue and I get 
deprived of oxygen, I think,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.940
"Hurry up and drop, ball... 
Preferably on the other side."

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.100
Bring it!

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.670
If I slow down even for a moment, 
it'll delay everyone else.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.310
At my height, if I ease off
on my jumps even a little,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.890
I'll be shot down in an instant.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.270
Run! Run!

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.050
Jump! Jump!

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.060
If you want to stay here!

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.270
Like hell

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.940
am I going to let you spike freely!

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.400
Right now, the sides of the court...

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.150
And then...

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.830
Break through the middle!

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.250
Pipe penetration!

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.480
Nice point!

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.210
Hinata!

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.610
Damn it!

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.420
Sorry. I totally got lured out.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.580
I knew that this would be the 
perfect timing for a pipe,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.970
and yet... just now...

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.120
I was about to toss to Hinata.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.060
I was about to have my toss taken.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.440
Nice determination, Hinata!

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.420
Thanks!

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.980
The ultimate... decoy.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.740
Aoba Johsai                  Karasuno

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.770
Karasuno caught up.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.740
They're tied.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.270
I'll go get the towels.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.240
Thanks.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.700
Thanks.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.700
The rallies are lasting a lot longer 
than the first and second set.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.650
That's got to be tiring.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.320
But...

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.900
I'm jealous.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.800
What are we going to do 
about #10's broad cross?

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.310
Let's get rid

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.220
of that broad cross.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.790
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.790
Tanaka, nice point!

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.540
In the next rotation, 
Hinata will be in the back line.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.540
Hey! Are you all right?

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:00.520
I-I'm fine...

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.280
Make sure you cash in all you've got 
before moving into the back line.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.350
I know that!

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.900
Kunimi, nice receive!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.700
Kindachi!

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.810
#12! #12!

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.650
Nishinoya, nice receive!

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:12.560
Chance!

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.730
Is he going to do another 
broad... or wait... Huh?

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.450
No mark?

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.160
Did they give up on the block?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.470
All right! Go free, Hinata!

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.000
I can see really well.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.860
Nice receive!

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.030
Was there no mark on purpose?!

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.490
In this short amount of time...

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.300
Just how fast at
 switching gears are they?

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.930
Now a dump?!

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.120
A dump attack taking advantage 
of our moment of hesitation.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.610
Let's get rid of that broad.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.700
Get rid of it? How?

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.070
That shrimp's broad is god-like.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.100
It's really fast, but his 
body will go with the momentum,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.790
so he won't be able to redirect the ball.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:08.630
Yeah.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.710
Instead of blocking that 
broad cross, we'll use a dig.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.450
Right!

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.960
An unstoppable block is just going to 
get in the way of receiving the ball.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:23.900
No matter how difficult things get, 
don't forget to think and communicate!

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.640
Nice receive!

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.850
We can't even bring Seijoh 
down with that!

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.560
Damn. Right when we don't 
want them to get ahead,

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.900
his turn to serve comes up.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.810
We'll end this in one!

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.480
Right!

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.320
Rule the Court

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.010
Net in! All right! Lucky!

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.540
There's nothing you could have 
done about that. Move on.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.420
Damn it. We're two points behind again.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.250
Stay calm.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.090
Sorry! Cover!

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.300
All right!

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.300
Got it!

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.300
Kageyama!

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.920
Asahi, last!

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.140
That was close!

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.100
Calm down! Don't lose your cool!

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.900
This isn't ending any time soon...

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.090
When you make it through a long rally,

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:22.870
you can shift the game's momentum.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.160
With this rally, getting that one 
point will be crucial.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.780
Cover!

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.250
I'm not going to let you have it...
 the point, or our momentum!

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.720
It connected!

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.210
But who'll get the last hit?

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.420
Center!

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.380
Shoyo, we're counting on you!

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.200
Break through!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.920
Stop him!

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:51.680
All right!

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.890
Aoba Johsai                 Karasuno

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.080
Damn. They've used up their two timeouts.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.610
It can't be helped.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.700
They've got to physically break 
that momentum with a timeout,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.190
or Seijoh's going to take control.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.860
A-At times like this,
your voice is important!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.390
Something... Isn't there something?

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.690
Make sure you're using your voice!

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.760
Something to change the momentum?

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.330
Go, go, Karasuno!

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.330
Push it, push it, Karasuno!

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.820
It doesn't have to be a trump card.
 Just something...

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.440
Hey, first it's "go, go."

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.200
Anything to give us a change.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.620
Match me!

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.080
Seijoh touched net. Thank goodness!

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.090
I'm sorry.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.980
Don't mind.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.050
But...

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.280
The shrimp's on the back line!

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.490
We're counting on you.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:34.270
Right.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.290
If they miss here, Seijoh will 
have the advantage at 20 points.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.500
Hinata, relax!

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.690
Right!

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.300
If they take the momentum,
 we won't be able to catch up.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.060
Hey, Shimada, look at that.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.170
T-Tadashi's the pinch server?!

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:57.030
What is Keishin thinking?!
He's an idiot!

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.230
I told him that it's still mostly pure luck!

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.980
I think he wants even that pure luck.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.610
You don't know what's going
to change the momentum.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.130
Karasuno's got a pinch server?

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.710
Are they good at serves?

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.500
Or are they just simply trying 
to change the atmosphere?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.730
Either way, we're not giving you this flow.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.680
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.150
But I'm not gonna lose!

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.010
He doesn't want to be pulled 
out, even for a moment.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.110
Yamaguchi.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.080
Go and change the momentum.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.320
R-Right!

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.940
This line...

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.600
Everything beyond this 
line is a different world.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.900
It feels like the temperature 
on this side... is different.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.410
You got a great spot, Yamaguchi!

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.230
Right!

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.850
Blast them one, Yamaguchi!

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.140
Nice serve!

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.640
N-Nice serve. Take it easy.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.380
Asahi, do you understand the 
meaning of "take it easy"?

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.770
Anyone would be scared at this timing.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:10.400
This is his first serve at his 
first high school match!

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.050
Is the coach a super sadist?!

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.980
I'm nervous, too.
Crap, Yamaguchi will feel that.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.740
Stay calm...

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.830
I think the back of my head is a little 
safer than if Hinata was serving.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.510
Is that all right?

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.000
He already has enough reason to be nervous,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.660
but won't there be more pressure
from playing with his seniors?

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.500
Oh, right.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.690
Hey, Yamaguchi!

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.140
Hit a nice serve!

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.350
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.800
Dang... He's so stiff.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.240
It can't be helped.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.860
Relying on your team is most of volleyball.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.740
Serving is the only time you're alone.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.130
Everyone will be looking at you,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.660
and you've got all the pressure.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.980
I'm scared... but...

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.530
But when you're standing in the serve 
position, you're the center of attention,

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.670
no matter who you are.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.260
Show them...

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.970
That you can fight, too!

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.390
Jump floater?!

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.610
Go in!

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.580
Rule the Court

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.330
Aoba Johsai                     Karasuno

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.300
Go, go, Seijoh!
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.300
All right. Lucky!

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.820
I-I'm sorry...

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.880
Don't mind!

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.150
D-Don't worry about it.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.950
Don't mind!

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.880
I'm sorry...

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.790
Nope.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:57.800
Don't mind, Yamaguchi-kun.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.680
Don't worry about it.
Shake it off.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:01.890
Yamaguchi!

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.600
S-Sorry!

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.820
Make sure you make it next time.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.860
Next...

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:12.740
Right!

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:19.780
Karasuno's mood changed?

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.040
The captain's amazing. 
I'm still no match for him.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.300
Man, but I feel relieved,
 like most of the pressure's gone.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.280
Same here.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.490
Eh? So he got brought out 
here because of a pinch,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.510
but if he fails, he'll be pulled out?

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.090
That's sort of sad.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.910
That's the job of a pinch server.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.970
That one shot

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.780
has both the game's momentum 
and their pride riding on it.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.620
And Tadashi messed up.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.100
But this chance to feel this 
regret and his own helplessness

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.950
will definitely make him stronger.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.500
Did the black team cheer up of a sudden?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.900
It's just like Tattsun says...

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.740
You don't know

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.460
what's going to change the momentum.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.210
Next...

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.650
The chance to fight next...

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.750
Grab it!

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.730
Daichi-san, nice receive!

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.880
All right. Don't let them break the streak!

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.880
Though it looks so close, 
Seijoh's back is so far.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.560
If they can't get any points now, Karasuno 
will just have to wait and lose.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.830
Cover! Cover!

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.690
Is he spiking from lower because he's tired?

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.820
Kunimi-chan!

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.710
They're so high-level...

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:37.710
Nice cover!

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.990
This is the third game?

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.990
It's coming back. Chance ball!

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.010
Out, huh?

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.120
I'm sorry!

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.330
Aoba Johsai                   Karasuno

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.590
All right!

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.830
Come on... break! Break!

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.790
Out!

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.510
Nice call!

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.220
Aoba Johsai                 Karasuno

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.030
Good! Good!

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.200
Ryu, last!

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.600
Get one more point!

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.250
Yeah!

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.030
The ball in front of me... Everything!

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.400
His foot! He kicked it!

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.990
All right!

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.990
Looks painful.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.200
Nice, Hinata!

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.690
Break!

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.560
One more point!

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.120
Aoba Johsai                 Karasuno

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.120
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.980
One more...

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.090
Daichi-san!

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:44.470
I'm not going to lose!

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.430
I'm not going to lose!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.140
I'm not going to lose!

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.820
I'm not going to...

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.140
All right!

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.610
They all feel the same.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.870
Now Seijoh's at

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.450
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.450
match point.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:14.540
One more point!
One more point!

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.020
Guys, don't freak out!

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.590
If we fall, fall forward!

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.380
All right!

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.620
Asahi-san, nice shot!

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.620
One more point!

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.370
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:32.870
One more!

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.820
Nice serve!

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.000
If I miss this serve, the game will be over.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.080
Even if they are able to receive 
it, and do a decent attack,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.090
it'll all be over.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.360
A quick is coming! 
Make sure you don't drop it!

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.620
At least...

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:51.320
Touch it!

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.000
Crap! It's going past the net!

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.120
They're going to hit it head on!

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.160
One-hand toss!

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.250
All right!

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.620
Next Episode Preview

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.460
You guys are doing a great 
job of pushing forward.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.230
Thanks!

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.880
24 vs 24... A deuce.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.900
The one who gets two points first, wins.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.630
Of course, we'll be the ones to win.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:08.920
Yeah!

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.680
