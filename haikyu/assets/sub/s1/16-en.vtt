00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
OP

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.650
Yes.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.150
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.730
Too bad. Shake it off, Ikejiri.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.790
Nice fight.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.250
Karasuno isn't using it.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.730
Their usual quick set,
 without looking at the toss...

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.000
But, although it's still
 rough around the edges,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.580
they've learned to do normal quicks.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.060
Although they're still lousy at it,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.510
they can spot openings in the court.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.060
They must've had good practice matches
 in what little time they've had.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.630
They're improving their existing moves,
 adding new ones,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.970
and creating the best attacks
 for each match.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.280
Before they were a dangerous team
 that relied solely on brute force,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.540
but now they have knowledge.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.700
Polish and Refine

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.430
But they still make a lot
 of common mistakes.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.790
It's impossible to improve
 receiving overnight.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.000
Karasuno                       Tokonami

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.250
Nice serve, Chaya.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.000
One more.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.080
Noya-san.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.040
All right.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.970
Looks like they're going
 to win the first set in no time.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.370
That libero is a pesky one.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.990
Now that the dude with the beard is playing,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.750
Kageyama has even more options.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.240
Don't worry.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.460
Come on. Let's turn it around with this one.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.450
Yeah.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.980
One more.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.890
Hinata, give us a nice serve.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.650
Yes.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.340
Let's score with this one.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.220
Yeah.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.060
Haikyu!!

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.970
Episode 16: Winners and Losers

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.390
In our last junior high tournament,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.190
we made it through the 
first match by sheer luck.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.400
Senkan Junior High
Furusan Kita Junior High
Amado Junior High
Taihaku Junior High

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.340
But the second match was 
against a powerhouse.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.750
We didn't stand a chance against them.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.180
When we were about to totally 
give up, you said something...

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.520
They're in junior high too, just like us.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.830
They're not unbeatable.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.900
We'll never win if we don't believe we can.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.750
You never get discouraged, Sawamura.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.300
Of course I'm not discouraged.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.820
This is our last tournament.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.220
Our opponents are junior high students, too.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.100
That's right.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.390
We won our first match, 
for the first time ever.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.900
All right. We can win the second match
 for the first time ever, too.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.850
Yeah.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.170
All right.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.770
However...

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.730
Senkan                                                     Taihaku

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.760
...we couldn't instantly become a strong team.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.120
Sorry, Sawamura.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.260
Sorry.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.330
Let's turn it around with this one.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.670
Senkan                               Taihaku

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.390
We weren't surprised that we lost.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.280
We weren't all that angry about it, either.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.300
In fact, we felt relieved

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.480
because we wouldn't
 have tiring practices anymore.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.940
But...

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.030
...you were the only one 
who seemed upset.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.990
Seeing you like that, I was jealous.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.510
I don't know why.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.200
Do your best! Tokonami Spirit

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.210
All right.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.440
Are you okay, Ikejiri?

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.930
Hinata, nice serve.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.300
Tamagawa.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.510
Nice receive, Tamagawa-senpai.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.220
Bring it to the left.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.270
Ikejiri-senpai.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.730
Tokonami                       Karasuno

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.310
All right.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.060
The rumors about Karasuno aren't true.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.430
Fallen powerhouse? Yeah, right.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.370
They're on a whole other level.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.550
Rankings have nothing to do with it!

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.810
"We'll never win if we don't believe we can."

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.570
Oh, um...

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.170
I was just quoting a friend.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.540
It's starting.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.480
Yeah.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.090
I don't have the charisma to convince them.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.280
That was stupid.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.760
It just slipped out.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.250
Nice serve, Kageyama.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.540
An service ace...

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.210
Karasuno has stepped up their game,
 even after winning the first set.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.020
Karasuno              Tokonami

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.730
Damn.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.110
Ikejiri.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.480
It's high.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.390
All right.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.670
All right.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.880
Karasuno                                  Tokonami

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.670
Maybe we shouldn't be
 so happy about one lousy point.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.880
It's fine.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.580
One point can be the
 beginning of a scoring streak.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.090
Everyone...

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.870
"We'll never win if we don't 
believe we can," right?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.520
We'll hang in there.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.060
We might be weak, but we're stubborn!

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.470
Let's go win this!

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.250
Yeah.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.190
Aya.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.320
Yui, get it.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.320
Yes.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.820
Out.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.250
Good call.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.370
Shirato                                          Karasuno

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.050
Even if we're not confident that we'll win,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.010
even if others tell us we 
don't stand a chance, we...

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.560
"We must never tell ourselves that."

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.490
Nice serve.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.550
Aya.

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.530
Score!

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.910
Don't mind, don't mind. No regrets.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.270
You could've saved that one, Yui.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.950
Huh?

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.880
I'm sorry. I've lost so many of them.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.890
Save the apologies for later.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.380
Get up. It's not over yet.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.930
All right!

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.010
Karasuno                       Tokonami

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.530
It's Karasuno's match point.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.510
It'll probably be a cinch for them.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.110
But for us...

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.070
One more point...

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.360
It's not over.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.700
It's not over.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.690
We're ready, Karasuno.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.020
Sakurai.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.590
Ikejiri-senpai.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.500
We're not beaten yet.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.550
It's not over yet.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.610
Left.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.180
All right.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.780
Damn it!

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.700
I'll save the next one for sure!

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.720
One more! Let's turn it around.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.600
Yeah!

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.190
They're serious.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.750
They're taking us seriously.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.270
Everyone in the gym thought 
we'd be pushovers, but not anymore.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.810
Because these guys...

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.770
...are serious.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.660
Karasuno

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.420
Hey. Quit spacing out, airhead.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.400
Let's go－

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.400
We won.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.520
Yeah.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.720
Do we play... another match?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.420
Yeah, because we won.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.560
We won.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.070
We won.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.990
We won!

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.160
We can play another match.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.450
We can stand on the court again.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.620
He was like a little animal, 
hungry for victory...

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.710
...and now he's tasted it 
for the first time.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.550
Yeah.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.790
Do they realize they have 
another match this afternoon?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.670
Huh?

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.140
I mean, it was impossible for the 
other team to make a comeback.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.180
They should've conserved their energyー

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.310
I'm glad they didn't.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.550
We got to see them be serious.

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.350
Although we didn't get 
to see the freak quick.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.060
The match on that court's done, too. 
Dateko won handedly.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.780
So it'll be Karasuno versus Dateko.
 Who will win?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.690
Let's go.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.610
It won't matter if we don't win.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.750
Prefectural High School Sports Tournament 
Girls' Volleyball

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:14.500
Stop crying already.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.790
They aimed serves at me.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.110
They scored so many points off of me.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.450
And we kept the ball in play.
 That's volleyball.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.180
They were better at it than us.
 That's why we lost.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.400
It is not any single player's fault.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.920
Captain, sensei wants to have a word.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.150
Okay. I'll be back, okay?

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.820
Michimiya-senpai is amazing.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.920
She's practiced the hardest of all.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.180
You'd think she'd be the most upset.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.970
No...

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.250
She's trying to stay composed,
 since she's our captain.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.710
She's waiting until she's out of sight.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:28.010
I did all I could.
I never skipped practice.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.390
The day I saw that
 tournament on TV, I said,

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:37.950
half-jokingly,
 "I'm Japan's future champion."

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:43.340
But as soon as we started conditioning,
 I began to lose steam.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.500
And now it's all over.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.260
That was fast. It's still only June.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.210
I should've... I should've 
trained a little harder.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.290
Running, conditioning... I should
 have done it all a little harder.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.690
I would've been a better captain...

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.330
If only I could've
 been a fiercer receiver.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.340
If only I had gone one step further.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:17.400
Maybe then, I could've played more volleyball.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.640
Sawamura.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:29.840
Ikejiri.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.730
Win! Then win some more!

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.770
Win for us, too.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.730
Yeah. You got it.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.310
There must be thousands 
of guys in this country...

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.010
...whose last season gets cut short.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.390
Winning all the preliminaries 
and going on to nationals...

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.970
If all this were a work of fiction...

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.810
The guys who go to nationals 
 would be the protagonists,

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.050
and the rest of us would just be extras.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.910
But, regardless...

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.770
We got to play...

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.790
We got to play...

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:09.290
...volleyball.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.150
Karasuno was amazing.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.650
Especially that little #10! He was unreal.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.160
I know, right?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.540
His quicks were right on the money.

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.530
Wh-What?

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.350
I'm happy. What's wrong with that?

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.870
No one's ever said stuff 
like that about me before.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.180
I didn't say anything.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.330
I'm glad you're getting all the attention.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.260
The more our opponents 
are wary of you,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.300
the more they'll bring out 
the best in you.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.140
Yeah, I don't really 
understand what you mean,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.230
but you're scary when you're smiling.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.950
Ouch, ouch...

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.700
Yeah, he's right.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.880
"That little #10" gets a big reaction.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.290
The bigger, the better.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.800
The more Hinata shines,
 the more he blinds the defense.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:49.250
Oh.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.720
So, the starting lineup for the next match
will be the same as the first.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.140
Our next match is at 1:30 PM.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.950
Keep yourselves warm.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.640
Have a light lunch.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.720
Don't fill yourselves up.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.900
Yeah.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.030
Next up is no-eyebrows guy's 
Iron Wall school.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.790
It's Date Kogyo.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.740
I know that.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.950
Dateko defeated us in March.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.880
That match made Azumane-san want to quit.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.160
Asahi-san...

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.890
Every single spike by Asahi got 
blocked in this one match...

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.300
They blocked all of Asahi-san's spikes.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.350
Hinata, Kageyama.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.820
Got a minute?

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:46.680
Asahi.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.100
It's time to go.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.820
I'm counting on you.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.920
Date Kogyo is a powerful opponent.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.240
Their blocking devastated us three months ago.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.390
But this time, we have the best decoy ever.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.380
You brought out the best in Hinata.

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.380
Asahi...

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.720
Our ace needs you to do the same!

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.980
All right. We'll win the second match, too!

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.580
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:50.620
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:50.620
Iron Wall of Date

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.070
Dateko... fight!

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.540
Yeah.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.200
Start running!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.010
You're getting intimidated again.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:05.740
Dateko's scary. I'm glad 
I'm not playing against them.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:11.020
I felt so sorry for the spiker
 up against Dateko in the last match.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.130
He was unable to do anything, literally.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:17.150
Captains.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.860
All the best.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.320
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.320
Iron Wall of Date

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.320
I don't know how to say it...

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.740
...but it's like Dateko 
has taken over the court.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.620
We're receiving first, 
from this side of the court.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.290
Yeah.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.130
Get ready to receive!

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.040
Yeah.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.110
Here goes. Keep it in play.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.240
Yeah.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.300
It's only been three months 
since Dateko defeated us.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.070
Though our team has made 
definite progress,

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:50.350
our second and third-years might 
still be feeling the sting of defeat.

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:55.600
We have to fix that somehow. 
We can't be intimidated by Dateko.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.580
Rolling...

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.780
...Thunder...

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.940
Again!

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.910
That was perfect.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.320
Noya-san, nice receive.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.900
Perfection itself! Except for the name.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.930
The name is perfect, too!

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.590
Teach me! Teach me the Again version, too!

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.250
How's that different from the regular one?

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.040
What was that?

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.110
He saved it.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.850
You're showing off again.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:32.100
Hey, Nishinoya,
 you're gonna make Daichi mad.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.810
All right. There's nothing to worry about.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.810
All of you, keep your eyes forward.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.350
Because you have me guarding your backs.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.530
A-Awesome!

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.450
Awesome.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.710
Wow. He restored the team's confidence.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:00.600
Yeah.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.480
He's a little guy,
 but incredibly charismatic.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.630
The libero is not just the guardian.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.290
He also encourages the team from behind.

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.570
He's a truly outstanding libero.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.900 position:20% line:20%
Fly

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.150
Iron Wall of Date

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.650
Line up.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.850
Let's play.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:00.500
Next Episode Preview

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.540
That no-eyebrows guy blocked 
you, didn't he, Asahi-san?

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.540
Y-Yeah.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.510
He's so intimidating.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.810
But you're older than him. Don't worry.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:08.550
Huh?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.720
That's enough already.

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.930
