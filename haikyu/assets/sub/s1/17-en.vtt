WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
That was pretty good, Hinata.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
You bastard!

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.480
Dateko                   Karasuno

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.240
The powerful iron wall 
defeated us three months ago.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.110
All the blockers vanish from sight...

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.240
And the view of the other side
 of the net opens up.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.500
That's what I used to see, too,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.290
until the iron wall blocked my view.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.240
What does the other side 
of the iron wall look like?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.510
Rolling...

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.640
...Thunder...

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.770
Again!

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.270
All right. There's nothing to worry about.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.240
All of you, keep your eyes forward.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.570
Because you have me guarding your backs.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.790
A-Awesome!

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.670
Fly

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.670
Iron Wall of Date

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.670
Line up.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.830
Let's play!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.020
Haikyu!!

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.060
Episode 7: The Iron Wall

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.190
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go, Dateko!

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.190
Iron Wall of Date

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.190
All right, listen up.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.210
I admit, Karasuno's quicks were amazing.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.400
But they were amazing only 
because of that guy's height.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.440
He jumps high, but the quicks 
themselves are nothing extraordinary.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.660
Don't get mesmerized by him.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.410
Shut him down completely, 
like you did their ace!

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.260
Show them the iron wall again.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.420
Yeah.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.510
Karasuno

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.510
Gauging from their first match,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.580
they'll start off with a powerful serve.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.310
The serve breaks your formation,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.720
then they block your return.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.780
Dateko's strategy is to attack
 those who can't keep up.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.500
So, for the first serve,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.490
make sure your receive is solid.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.400
Yeah.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.800
You know what to do. Right, Kageyama?

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.520
Yes.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.360
All right.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.690
Now, go tear down the iron wall!

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.680
Yeah.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.230
Karasuno.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.330
Fight.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.370
Yeah.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.790
Karasuno's ace starts as rear guard.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.680
Yeah. They're starting with their
 best receiving formation.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.400
But Dateko's formation is the 
same as in the first match.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.270
Do your best.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.140
Bring it on.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.900
Let's do this.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.110
Kamasaki, nice serve.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:17.650
Nice serve.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.770
Daichi-san.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.740
Nice receive.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.990
His form is clean.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.660
I can't tell where he's going to toss.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.550
All right. Nice spike, Hinata.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.810
Too bad.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.560
I thought that blocker was one step behind.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.800
Is that what you call read blocking?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.910
When they jump as soon as they see the toss?

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.940
Yeah.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.240
All of our opponents so far

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.400
only used commit blocks. They jumped
 after they knew who would get the toss.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.110
But Dateko has perfected the read block.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.450
They jump as soon as the toss goes up.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.950
In other words...

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.280
They're not easy to trick with decoys.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.420
That would leave their blocks
 one step behind, if not for #7.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.240
He quickly makes up the difference.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.450
He's not only tall, but fast as well.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.930
H-He's scary.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.260
Those read blocks
 are going to be tricky.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.080
I wonder how Karasuno's 
going to deal with them.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.140
We'll see.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.350
They haven't played their trump card yet.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.310
Karasuno                         Dateko

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.820
Kageyama, nice serve.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.280
Nice serve. Let's score.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.960
I hit it to the libero.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.440
His serve is as powerful as ever.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.750
He'll be scary when he 
learns how to control it.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.830
He saved it.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.750
Amazing.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.320
Ryu, sorry. Cover.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.920
All right.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.170
Back!

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.900
A back attack?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.390
They didn't use that in the last match.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.840
Asahi-san.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.270
Damn.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.730
Don't worry about it.
 Don't worry! Switch it up.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.940
I'm sorry, Asahi-san! 
I'll save the next one.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.360
Yeah. I'm counting on you, 
but I'll score next time.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.640
Hey, what was that? 
He's supposed to get dejected.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.840
Quit being mean-spirited, Futakuchi.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.830
Ouch.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.040
Karasuno                          Dateko

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:47.490
Huh?

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.050
All right.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.380
Net violation...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.890
Don't worry about it.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.500
Dateko touched the net.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.690
That was a close call for Karasuno.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.020
But they sure are fast.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.690
Two blockers are immediately ready, 
no matter how fast the attack.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.300
This is going to be a tough one.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.050
Nice receive.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.080
Futakuchi.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.190
Open.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.870
Asahi.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.680
Was that out?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.110
Was that our point?

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.590
Nice, Azumane.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.890
Karasuno               Dateko

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.890
Karasuno is two points ahead,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.540
but they're barely avoiding being shut down.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.940
They're not scoring with ease.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.940
They're barely getting by the blockers.
And if that blocking keeps up,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.940
Nice receive.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.190
they'll lose momentum quickly.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.820
Futakuchi.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.450
Nice one touch, Hinata.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.530
For real?

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.230
Chance ball.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.700
When they think they're about to score,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.210
we score instead.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.170
That breaks their spirit, 
and boosts our morale.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.090
It's the ultimate defense, 
the fastest offense.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:14.510
That's what you call...

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.140
...blocking.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.770
Iron Wall of Date

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.730
Nice block.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.730
Nice, Aone.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.650
A high, fast, and expansive wall...

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.320
Truly...

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.400
...an iron wall.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.380
Damn it.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.360
Don't worry about it.
On to the next.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.130
Huh?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.840
We'll definitely score
 with the next one.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.260
Definitely?

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.760
Are we doing it?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.550
Are we gonna zoom? Are we?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.890
It's about time.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.230
Do your best jump, go as fast as you can,

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.170
and fly.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.480
I'll get the ball...

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.680
...to you.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.680
Commercial break

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.440
Karasuno's fastest attacker 
is probably that #10.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.340
He knows his quicks are 
up against our wall,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.550
so why doesn't he appear nervous?

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.890
When we faced Nekoma,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.100
our freak quicks got blocked. Why is that?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.560
I know. Because Inuoka was awesome.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.780
Well... sure, let's assume that's true.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.110
It's because Nekoma's middle blocker 
got accustomed to Hinata's moves.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.250
That's right. He got used to it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.140
But I also think it's because Nekoma
 had a really smart player.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.040
It was

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.790
probably the pudding-head.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.250
You mean Kenma?

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.210
Kenma-san's caught a cold.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.720
Shut up, Inuoka. I don't have a cold.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.980
To be honest, I never thought 
they'd regroup that fast.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.430
But fast or slow, any team will get used
 to our freak quick.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.430
Your quicks are powerful weapons, 
but they aren't invincible.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.900
What matters is...

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:35.950
...how we use them.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.820
Karasuno                        Dateko

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.610
Ryu.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.120
All right.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.160
I don't care how fast your reflexes are...

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.120
Your read block won't be fast enough.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.580
What was that?

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.460
All right.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.310
Good.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.630
And there you have it. The monster quick!

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.130
It sure is powerful.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.520
It's scary. It's awful.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.980
That genius gets on my nerves...

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.580
What a reckless toss.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.270
He made a random toss to thwart 
Aone by brute force.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.430
But the spiker was there to hit it.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.400
He must've spiked it by sheer luck.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.620
That #10...

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.770
Do you know who he is?

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.880
No. I never saw him in 
junior high tournaments, either.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.720
Was it luck or by design?

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.180
We're counting on you, Tsukishima.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.760
Yes.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.610
King. Toss a little away from the net.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.540
I don't want to get blocked.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.770
Huh?

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.540
I said, "Okay."

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.900
You didn't say it clearly.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.530
You don't want to take orders 
from peasants. Is that it?

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.400
Huh?

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.490
You guys, stop it.
 Don't you ever learn?

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.800
Kageyama finally used that quick.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.410
Dateko must be confused right now.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.290
You won't see a quick like that 
anywhere else in the whole world.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.280
It's a scary thing to have to anticipate.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.460
I'm sorry.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.600
Airhead! Hinata, you lousy airhead!

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.510
But, other than that, 
they need a lot of work.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.510
Don't worry. Don't worry.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.810
Noya-san, I'm sorry.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.720
Leave it to me.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.680
Karasuno                         Dateko

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.680
Aone, nice serve.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:32.040
All right.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.800
That one was an ordinary toss.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.080
Was the last one just luck?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.270
Or is #10 the only one who can do it?

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.730
Good job.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.780
Nice, Tsukishima. One more.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.950
Tsukki, nice.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.250
All right. If they score, we score back.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.760
Nice, Kamasaki.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.060
Way to go, Kama.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.490
We'll score back.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.420
All right.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.680
Karasuno 6 - 4 Dateko

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.350
Karasuno 6 - 5 Dateko

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.520
Karasuno 7 - 5 Dateko

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.260
The point spread isn't budging.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.310
Look at their rotation.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.820
Karasuno's #10 is vanguard again.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.030
There he is, #10...

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.440
Kageyama hasn't done that 
super-fast toss since.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.700
I just remembered. 
He was in Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:37.180
I saw him do a similar toss,
but it was too fast for the spikers.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:43.320
That toss makes me think he's 
reverted to a bad junior high habit.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.670
But...

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.330
That #10 spiked it.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.180
He spiked it effortlessly.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.350
Futakuchi.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.390
Karasuno                        Dateko

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.390
Nice, Futakuchi.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.880
You can't keep Dateko down for long.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.210
As soon as Karasuno's #10 
rotated to vanguard,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.200
Dateko made that awesome 
#7 blocker the vanguard.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.750
It's the iron wall
 versus the super-quick!

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.750
We used the freak quick only once.
They must think we just got lucky.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.440
Let's do another one.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.210
Yeah.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.680
Let serve! Move up!

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.970
He saved it.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.010
But a quick would be impossible.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.470
Who can he toss toー

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.060
All right.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.210
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.580
That toss again.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.040
And this time from the back of the court!

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.240
It wasn't... luck?

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.670
And Dateko calls a time out.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.990
Karasuno's #10 is amazing.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.920
Who can hit a toss like that?

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:05.650
The setter is the amazing one, for
getting his toss perfectly to the spiker.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.520
Who would expect a incredible 
technique like that?

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.640
We certainly didn't, at first.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.100
Karasuno             Dateko

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.100
If those quicks are intentional, 
our read block will be too slow.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.060
And yet, if we abandon that, 
they'll start pummeling us.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.200
When #10 might be about to spike,
 mark him instead of the toss.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.410
Jump when you can anticipate
 the toss's trajectory.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.610
But it's also possible those spikes
 were just lucky.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.640
Remain calm, and be ready for anything.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.590
Yes.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.680
I've never seen a quick like that, ever.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.270
I wonder if #10 is the 
only guy who can do it?

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.670
If that wasn't by luck, then he's a monster.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.340
Sure, those quicks were jaw-dropping,

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:53.260
but their ordinary quicks 
are nothing to sneeze at.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.120
Anyway, all we have to do is stop #10.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.150
You're taking the matter too lightly.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.440
Better than being too serious.
That's never popular with girls.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.010
What did you say?

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.140
Stop them, Aone.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.070
You bastard.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.750
But then again, all they 
have to do is stop #10.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.280
#10's the only guy drawing attention.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.330
Against the others, Dateko's 
blockers are definitely winning.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.470
For sure.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.620
Stop that #10, no matter what.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.020
Yeah.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.250
We must stop #10...

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.920
That #10...

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.670
That #10...

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.430
Iron Wall of Date

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:33.430
That #10...

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.510
That #10...

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.580
"That little #10" gets a big reaction.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.060
The bigger, the better.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.710
Bring it!

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.750
The more Hinata shines,

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.630
the more the blockers are blinded.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.630
We're late! What if we missed the match?

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.680
Who knew it would be so packed?

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.940
Hurry, hurry.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.620
Huh?

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.840
Oh, good. The boys' second match is still on.

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.830
Awesome! They're beating Dateko.

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.340
Bring it on.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.790
Damn, that was fast.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.370
Tough break, huh, Aone?

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.440
What was that?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.690
A quick?

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.690
He's a first-year, isn't he?

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:28.120
Wasn't that little boy's jump amazing?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:31.820
What are you smirking about?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.850
Good job, Hinata.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:34.530
Oh?

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.490
Way to go. Give us another one.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.520
Nice serve, one more!

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.670
Sugawara is on the bench...

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.910
Nishinoya.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.440
B!

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.330
Send me the toss.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.980
A two-way attack.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.710
Who's gonna spike?

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.500
He's gonna jump.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.420
He didn't jump?

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.620
That was an ordinary quick.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.770
They can change the
 speed of their tosses?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.060
Well, we actually have some rather 
interesting first-years...

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.290
If those guys start playing their part,

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.240
I feel Karasuno is going 
to improve explosively.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.490
That's what I think.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.870
Amazing.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.270
Damn, what's with that #10?

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.500
Hey, hey, hey.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.660
Don't get overwhelmed.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.480
Our attacks are scoring, too.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.430
Sure, that #10's a shocker,

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:34.300
but you've ground all
 kinds of spikers into the dust!

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.380
Even Karasuno's ace!

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.430
You can stop them again.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.510
Yes.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.000
Don't say "you." Say "we."

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.510
Futakuchi, I'm sorry to have thought

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.100
you were just a damned cocky 
underclassman all this time.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.230
You were thinking that?

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.790
Iron Wall of Date

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.500
He jumped twice!

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.800
He's so tall, he can reach above the net
with just a slight jump.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.550
He's not just tall. His arms are long, 
and his shoulders are broad.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.940
Those are all powerful weapons,

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.510
but that's not all.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.070
He stays calm and avoids tunnel vision.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.150
He has the will to block no matter what.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.560
He has it all. 
That's why he blocks so well.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.860
Hey, that block was bad news.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.700
Blocks like that can
 change a match's momentum.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.540
If we don't score the next one, 
Dateko could break our rhythm.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.200
Let's stop them again.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.250
Yeah.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.120
Stay calm!

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.710
One more!

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.630
Karasuno                        Dateko

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.630
Futakuchi, don't hold back!

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.250
Sorry! Cover!

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:02.870
Ryu.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:03.430
All right.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:04.600
Center.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.340
Hinata.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:05.800
Yes.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.460
All right.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.970
Nishinoya.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.250
Kageyama.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:14.770
Yes.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.730
Three Karasuno vanguards...

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.190
Who will it be?

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.360
Bring it!

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:28.580
#10!

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.760
Clearing the path...

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:41.860
...for the ace.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.970
The view of the other side of the net

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.700
opens up.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.990
Yes.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.400
This is the view.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.630
All right!

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.530
That was the pipe Nekoma used.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:20.970
Asahi-san.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.970
Asahi.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:20.970
Asahi-san.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.920
You guys... are awesome.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.420
Thank you.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.040
What are you talking about? 
You're the one who scored, Asahi-san!

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.410
Nice, Asahi-san.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.350
Be proud of it. Come on.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.710
Please open the way for the ace!

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.570
Yes.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.640
What's the matter?

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.310
It wasn't me that scored...

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.560
I didn't even spike the ball, but...

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.350
#10!

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.020
That...

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.640
...felt incredible.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.260
Being the best decoy ever
 is as cool as being the ace.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.510
"The best decoy ever."

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:19.400
All our secret weapons are out in the open.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.400
The moment of truth is near.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.040
Next Episode Preview

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:00.040
It's different.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.440
What's different, Aone?

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.290
Karasuno's ...
