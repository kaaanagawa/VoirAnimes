WEBVTT

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.190
Hey, your feet stopped short!

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.380
What happened to your serving and 
receiving reflexes from yesterday?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.580
You need to focus!

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.490
All I'm doing is receiving...

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.920
There's not much time left!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.570
I want to spike, too! 
I want to jump, too!

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.740
Go jump around, then!

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.500
Hey, you guys.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.210
I should give you fair warning.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.120
Daichi-san is usually gentle,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.870
but he's extremely scary when he gets angry.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.670
I mean extremely.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.880
We know.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.750
It won't be good if he finds out 
about this morning practice.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.730
It won't be good for me.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.960
It's not that I'm scared or anything.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.310
Absolutely not. Absolutely not at all.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.200
But anyway, the three of 
us here are the only ones

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.170
that know about this morning 
practice, so make sure that you...

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.570
Morning practice, huh? I knew it.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.960
Suga-san.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.700
Hey.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.840
But why...

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.550
He's a third-year.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.600
Because you were obviously weird yesterday.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.540
You're always barely on time,
 but you voluntarily

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.640
asked to be in charge of opening the lock.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.800
Oh... ah...

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.430
Don't worry, don't worry. 
I won't tell Daichi.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.640
This is like secret training or something.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.180
It's kind of thrilling.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.080
Haikyu!!

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.580
Episode 3: The Formidable Ally

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.770
Come and get it!

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.440
Good, that was excellent.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.980
Hinata, don't get distracted.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.740
I want to hit the ball, too.
 Send me a toss, too.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.460
Tossing's your favorite, right? 
Send me a toss, too.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.390
Just one.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.770
Hey, Hinata...

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.250
Just try me out, once. Okay?

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.000
I refuse.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.800
What is this? Stinginess?

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.000
That's right, that's right.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.610
That came straight at you from front.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.750
Tossing and attacking happen 
only if there's a reception.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.140
Which you're too slow to even do, 
so don't talk cocky.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.420
For the three-on-three match this Saturday,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.410
I'll make every effort to give 
Tanaka-san all the tosses.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.380
Let Tanaka-san do the attacking.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.150
You do your best to not get in our way.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.660
When I can receive satisfactorily, 
you'll send me tosses, too?

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.580
I'll toss to anyone who's 
essential to winning.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.580
Right now, I don't think 
you're essential to winning.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.600
Nasty.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.050
What's it take to toss him 
a few here and there?

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.030
It's getting to be that time. 
We'd better clean up.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.250
Crap. Hurry! 
Erase all evidence!

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.240
Tanaka, get a mop!

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.080
Damn it...

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.080
Yes.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.570
Damn it...

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.650
Hinata, drop your waist,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.610
and hit it like you're sending it right back
 in the direction it came from.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:30.290
Yes.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.590
Here goes.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.520
Oh, that was a good one.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.420
Hey, Hinata.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.600
You want me to toss to you, 
starting tomorrow morning?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.550
Really? You will?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.690
I'm the official setter 
of Karasuno, you know.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.390
You want to practice spiking, right?

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.110
Oh, yes. I love spiking.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.730
It feels great when it works,
 and it's awesome!

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.350
Sounds like you got some spiking memories.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.420
Yes. All three years in junior high 
there was no setter or anything.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.820
I was the only club member.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.610
My friends in the basketball 
club would toss for me.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.990
Yikes, I'm sorry. I didn't 
mean for it to go there.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.560
Even after club activities, 
I had first-years,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.080
mothers, setters from the girl's team
 throw tosses to me...

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.400
We got along well and 
we're friends, but still,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.970
they weren't really teammates.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.470
That's why I used to wonder what kind 
of setter I'd have in high school.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.560
You're lousy as shit.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.520
I was looking forward to it...

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.730
You suck.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:37.950
...before I got here.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.440
Like I said, I'm a setter. 
I'll toss to you.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.220
But if you tossed to me...

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.650
I'd kinda feel like I've lost.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.370
Hinata, why do you insist
 on getting in Kageyama's face?

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.930
Personally, I try to avoid confronting guys
 who are stronger than me.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.590
At the junior high tournament...

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.700
he was so much bigger and taller than me.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.850
He was so strong.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.180
It was horrible when 
he stood in front of me.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.560
I understand how that must feel.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.820
I came to Karasuno because I was 
going to beat Kageyama.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.910
I see. But, Hinata, is beating Kageyama 
all you want out of volleyball?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.240
Oh... um...

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.610
He's practicing through his lunch break?

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.520
I just want to become strong 
enough to defeat Kageyama.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.950
If I can do that, I'll be on even 
ground with any strong opponent.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.500
I wouldn't be easy to beat in a match.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.340
I don't want to lose any more.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.880
I see...

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.380
So, in other words, Kageyama is the best player
 in your grade level, as far as you know.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.520
Y-Yes...

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.560
He sure doesn't like admitting it.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.530
But if he was your
 most formidable opponent,

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.140
now he's your most formidable ally.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.070
I don't think you're essential to winning.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.350
All right, let's do some receiving.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.280
All right.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.300
Thanks for taking out the trash.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.800
One, two, three, four.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.600
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.740
Two, two, three, four.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.600
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.670
All right. One, two, three, four.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.710
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.610
Two, two, three, four.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.710
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.790
Let's go.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.000
Hey. Where are you going?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.460
We can't handle the
 ball freely in there.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.450
I found a place we can practice.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.760
Where?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.730
Good job, Kageyama! Well done.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.980
Don't be condescending.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:15.500
Don't get mad at every little thing.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.650
You guys sound sleepy.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.850
Oh, y-you think so? 
Maybe I studied too much.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.460
M-Me, too. I studied...

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.060
Nobody will buy that from you!

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.840
Huh?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.060
Excuse me.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.130
Hey, you made it.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.090
These are the first-year 
students who'll be joining us.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.150
New club members were supposed 
to be introduced next week,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.700
but we're having a match this Saturday,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.710
They're big.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.560
that'll be the true test of your skills.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.530
Yeah.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.820
Pleased to meet you.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.180
Fight...

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.150
Don't just use your hands.
Move your feet.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.710
Come on. You need to concentrate.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.560
I know that.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.200
We'll win this Saturday, 
be allowed into the gym,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.990
and join this club for real.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.830
But you, on the other hand, 
can't play setter unless you win.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.540
If you know that, then concentrate!

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.720
I said to take it easy 
when we practice outside.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.990
All you have to do is receive properly.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.640
Whatever, king.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.180
Hey.

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:45.520
Crap.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.380
What's the matter with him?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.130
He gets mad every time I call him "king."

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.900
It's a cool nickname, you know.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.580
I wonder if I could have 
a cool nickname, too.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.390
Like "little giant" or something.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.320
"Wind of a fast wind."
That has "wind" twice...

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.310
"The forest's—" 
That doesn't work.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.480
"The jet black—" Um...

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.590
"The one who descended from the northeast—"

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.880
Hey, let's get back to it.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.110
I wonder what our first-year 
opponents are like.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.590
They'll be better than 
playing against our senpais.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.960
Who cares what they're like?

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.930
There's no choice for me but to win.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.730
That's what I was going to say.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.690
Don't cluck your tongue.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:32.910
Let's do this.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.860
Hey. You don't receive with your face.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.330
There's something I don't like about 
those newbie first-years...

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.150
You don't like anyone you 
meet for the first time.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.720
You know. That's your personality, right?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.790
My personality?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.250
But those guys sure were beyond expectations.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.220
Are you going to be okay 
in the match on Saturday?

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.290
O-Of course. I'm on the team, after all.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.890
That's true. There's Kageyama, too.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.350
Equipment Room

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.350
But don't you think Kageyama's 
mellowed out since junior high?

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.180
What? How has he mellowed out at all?

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.810
The guy's cocky as shit.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.650
Well... it's like when he was in junior high,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.210
he had this unwavering confidence.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.890
Like he was an unprecedented 
phenomenon or something.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.080
Either way he's cocky as hell.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.290
Sorry, sorry.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.510
I shouldn't have asked you that.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.770
Huh?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:37.960
One...

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.510
One more.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.290
Here goes.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.970
Yeah.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.260
Go.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.330
The back.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:46.970
Got it.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.140
Wow, they're really doing this outside.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.220
Are you the first-years that stirred 
up trouble on the first day?

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.030
Tee-shirts? Chilly.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.570
H-Huge...

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.890
Give it back.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.160
Isn't it time for elementary 
school boys to go home?

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.050
Who are you guys anyway?

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.870
You're the other first-years joining the club?

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.330
Hey.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:14.540
He's got height...

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.940
I was talking here.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.540
You, how tall are you?

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.720
Hey.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.360
Tsookie is 188 cm.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.240
He'll be 190 soon.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:23.550
190?

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.310
What are you bragging about, Yamaguchi?

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.100
Sorry, Tsookie.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.230
You're Kageyama of
 Kitagawa Daiichi, aren't you?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.690
What's an elite like you doing in Karasuno?

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.440
Huh?

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.140
Hey.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.360
We won't lose this Saturday, you hear me?

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.370
Oh, I see.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.860
It might be an important match for you two,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.100
but it doesn't matter to me at all.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.670
I'm not worried about winning or losing, 
so if you two really need to win,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.550
I can go easy on you if you like.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.260
What?

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:11.040
Whether you go easy or give it your all, 
the bottom line is I will win.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.470
You mean "we."

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.960
Amazing confidence. I expect 
nothing less of the "king."

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.480
Hey. Don't call me that.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.650
So it is true.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:21.650
What?

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.610
The rumor that he loses it when 
he's called the "king of the court."

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.080
What's wrong with "king"? It's cool.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.100
I think it suits you perfectly, "king."

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.580
This is out of my hands.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.130
What do you want from me, dude?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.610
I watched the prefecture
 preliminary tournament.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.600
That was some egocentric tossing.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.330
I can't believe your teammates tolerated it,
 because I just couldn't.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:51.970
Oh!

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.930
I guess what happened was because
 they couldn't tolerate it any more, either.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:00.810
Tsookie.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.960
What's going on?

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.130
I don't know what they're talking about,

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.620
but why is he holding 
back on this creepy guy?

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:17.100
Tell him off like you usually would.
 Say something back at him.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.080
Let's go.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.950
Um... hey.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.010
Running away?

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.300
I guess the king isn't what 
he's cracked up to be.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.910
Maybe I'll win against 
the king this Saturday, too.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.600
Shut up with the "king" crap.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.690
I'm here, too.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.600
I'll spike the ball over 
your head at the match.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.860
Huh?

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.500
W-What? Hey.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.860
You wanna fight, bastard?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
Let's not get so intense.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.780
Let's do this cheerfully, for fun.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.250
It's only a club activity, after all.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.220
What do you mean "only"?

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.570
I mean, literally.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.320
See you later.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.210
Hey, you! Stop!

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.850
Who are you guys?

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.000
First-year class-4, Tsukishima Kei.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.680
I'm Yamaguchi Tadashi.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.850
We're your teammates starting today.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.830
But enemies for now.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.390
Looking forward to seeing the king's tosses.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.140
See ya.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.760
Man, those guys totally give me the creeps.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.580
We'll pummel them to the ground.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.260
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.050
Hey, where are you going?

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:31.570
Huh?

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:34.250
We're not done yet.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.540
Tsookie, wait up. Is something the matter?

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.670
Guys that are intense for 
no reason get on my nerves.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.380
That king...

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:49.450
and that shrimp...

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.720
You get in position too slowly. 
I told you to focus.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.720
How much longer are they going to do this?

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.170
I know that.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.870
Who knows?

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.970
I'm so sleepy I can't stand it.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:08.730
King.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:13.920
Hey, Kageyama.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.580
It's too dark to see clearly. 
Don't hit it so hard.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.240
Sorry.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.420
Scary. What's with that guy?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.830
That's not an apologetic look.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.840
His nerves have been on edge 
since he met that big guy.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.310
But if he doesn't toss at me, I can't spike.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.010
I'll do my best receiving 'til I get a toss.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.850
All right. Do that again.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.200
He couldn't handle 
a ball like that before.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.730
Hey, don't go easy on me!

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.600
You asked for it!

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.330
Crap, I overslept.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.920
I'm tardy, I'm tardy.
 I gotta hurry...

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.580
Then, wham, I run into Kiyoko-san, 
who's eating bread.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:37.740
I wish.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.150
How long have they been at it?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.000
It's been fifteen minutes since I got here.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.330
Fifteen minutes straight?

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.530
What?

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.950
His overwhelmingly great agility makes 
up for his unskillful clumsiness.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.740
But you've reached your limit now!

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:05.890
You can't go any further...

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:06.870
Not yet!

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.250
I haven't dropped the ball yet!

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.920
Take that.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.160
Wow, bad character!
 How's he supposed to get that?

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.420
Crap! I didn't mean that...

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.380
Hinata's athleticism has been 
amazing since junior high.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.430
Huh?

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.840
It's not just that, though.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.600
I feel like he has the fortitude 
to become a winner.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.230
He has a different weapon, 
other than a gifted physique

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.560
or superior athleticism.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.190
I can't take it any more.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.820
I want him to stop.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.820
And in the very moment I think that...

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.210
one step.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.370
He saved it. That's amazing, Hinata!

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.840
I'll toss to anyone who's 
essential to winning.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.960
But I don't think you're 
essential to winning right now.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.930
I don't want to lose any more.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.890
I haven't lost yet.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.290
A toss?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.520
Kageyama tossed to him.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:21.490
Hinata is too worn out to spike it, though.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:36.510
He sure can jump.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.300
He recovered from being that worn out.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.010
And look how happy he is.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.390
I think that meant 
something special to Hinata.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.670
We got along so well and 
we're friends, but still,

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.390
they weren't really teammates.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.250
We have the ball tossed by the setter.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.750
That's something we take for granted.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.420
Hey.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.820
We're going to win tomorrow.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.830
But if he was your most formidable opponent,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.010
now he's my most formidable ally.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:17.840
O-Of course we will!

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.520
Tanaka, get water, water! And a washrag!

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.270
Karasuno Prefectural 
High School

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.280
Wait up, you idiot!

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.240
What's the point of getting 
worn out before the match?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.260
You'd better rest up.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.070
Damn... That was a draw.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.470
I won't ever lose to the likes of you.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.270
But...

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.710
He's irritating, and pisses me off...

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.510
He's going to send me tosses from now on.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.350
Tosses from the setter!

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.520
You and I are gonna win today.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.360
Let's get ready.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.230
Yeah.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.060
Morning, king.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.910
I'll...

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.280
break through any wall.
You'll see.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.390
Next Episode Preview

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.550
That Kageyama's not all 
he's cracked up to be.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.310
He couldn't even talk back to you, Tsookie.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.440
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.260
Sorry, Tsookie!

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.930
Well, let's see what the king is made of.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.170
And that shrimp, too.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.720
Grrr! Next episode of <i>Haikyu!!</i>
