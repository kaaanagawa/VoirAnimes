WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Ryu!

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.020
So much force!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.710
He saved it.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.610
Nice follow!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.070
Call for the toss again,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.280
ace.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.450
Shimada-san－

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.230
Suga!

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.080
One more!

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.540
Asahi.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.800
Wow...

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.360
What a sound! Like, kaboom.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720
Nice. Nice, Asahi.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.450
You too, Nishinoya.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.630
You guys, too. Nice toss, Suga.
 Nice receive, Nishinoya.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.960
So that...

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.380
That's an ace.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.540
Hey.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.540
You wanted to see the ace so much.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.260
You'd better not be intimidated now.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.880
I'm not intimidated.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.510
I don't have his height or power,

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.920
but I can still fight.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.510
It's my turn now.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:46.090
Haikyu!!

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.810
His palm is approximately 
wo centimeters thick.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.990
His peers' hands are twice that size,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.290
but those two centimeters 
separating the ball from the floor...

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.420
...keep the ace's life...

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.180
...connected to us.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.090
You didn't jump at all.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.140
Episode 10:  Yearning

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.170
That's because you've been
 ditching for a month.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.200
Yeah... I'm sorry.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.060
You're strict, Nishinoya.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.670
Daichi-san.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.380
Asahi's back and on the neighborhood
 team with the veterans.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.530
We'd better step up our game.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.790
What are you saying, Daichi-san?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.490
We have me on our team.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.490
We have me on our team.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.900
Huh? What?

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.260
Don't talk over me, Hinata.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.500
I was saying something awesome 
and you wrecked it, jackass!

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.810
He's amazing.
So was Nishinoya-kun's receive.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.210
If he can save a ball that's been blocked, 
we can be invincible!

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.440
What are you talking about?
It's impossible to save those every time.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.930
Huh?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.270
We're talking about balls 
going at least 100kph,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.030
traveling a distance
 of only two or three meters.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.770
There's no way you can save them all.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.170
Oh...

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.980
However...

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.400
It's important to know that
 getting blocked isn't the end.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.510
I'll save them, one after another, 
so don't worry about getting blocked.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.970
Knowing your teammates 
are there to back you up,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.040
Come on, he's an ace. 
Every one of his spikes will score.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.580
can set your mind at ease.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.120
What?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.120
I see.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.000
Karasuno         Neighborhood Assoc.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.590
Nice serve.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.200
Ennoshita.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.290
Cover.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.500
Overall, their receiving needs a lot of work.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.500
Sorry. Kageyama, cover for me.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.540
Right.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.510
He discerns the dropping point quickly 
and without hesitation.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.970
That setter is a first-year,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.640
so who am I going to pick for－

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.600
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.310
Thanks.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.170
But now I have this guy tossing to me,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.070
so I can get past any blocker.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.780
I guess he wasn't exaggerating.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.060
That was amazing, Shoyo!

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.600
What was that?
 Did I really just see that?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.330
He didn't even signal. 
He didn't vocalize anything, so how...

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.950
Hey!

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.880
Why did you jump there, shrimpy?

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.900
Shrimpy...

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.340
B-Because the toss will come
 to wherever I jump.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.920
Clearly, Shrimpy jumped without 
watching for the toss.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.230
Did that first-year setter perfectly 
coordinate with shrimpy's motion?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.100
And how could he be so certain
 the toss would be there?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.600
Who makes a full swing on that alone, 
without looking for the toss at all?

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.390
What's the matter with you guys?
 Are you freaks?

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.120
What?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.070
Freaks?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.470
But why?

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.580
How would I know?

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.950
Tsukishima, what's so funny?

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.420
I was preoccupied arranging the match,
so I didn't understand what he meant..

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.300
So I hid behind Kageyama's 
overwhelming abilities,

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.430
and enjoyed the relief.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.510
I guess that first-year setter
 is what you'd call a genius.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.510
Hinata, let's score again.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.480
Yeah.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.770
He can't be compared to a normal person.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.770
Nice serve.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.350
But...

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.980
Wow, a parallel toss.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.870
Damn! Even in his first game in a month, 
his timing's perfect!

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.320
Tanaka, you're way too happy.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.590
The timing of that toss and spike...

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.410
That's only possible after
 lots of training and time.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.740
Yes.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.830
But you can't build up
 the trust it takes overnight.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.160
That first-year setter has amazing talent,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.800
and the other guy is both
 trustworthy and dependable.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.760
All right!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.810
Karasuno is pretty good right now.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.920
Why didn't you tell me sooner, sensei?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.860
I did tell you, repeatedly.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.780
Karasuno       Neighborhood Assoc.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.570
All right.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.240
But I'm surprised that 
Shrimpy is the middle blocker.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.980
His fast attack is amazing, sure, 
but how's he at blocking?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.990
Huh?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.060
He's watching me.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.700
Speaking of, Hinata-kun's 
now battling the ace,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.930
and that's what he wants to become.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:27.760
Huh?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.540
Hinata-kun idolizes an ace
 called the Little Giant.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.460
That's why he came to Karasuno.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.670
Oh, that guy?

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.590
That's why he says he'll become the ace,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.270
and always gives it his all.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.370
And here Hinata-kun is now,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.470
squaring off with Karasuno's current ace.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.010
Well, this should be interesting.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.280
Though it's kind of like watching
 a kid fight an adult.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.200
Parallel toss.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.000
I'm marking the ace right now.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.960
I'm facing off with Karasuno's ace.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.020
Nice serve.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.680
Nice receive.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.670
Suddenly, he's in front of me...

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.020 line:20%
Karasuno      Neighborhood Assoc.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.020
I saw how he jumped before,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.890
but it's truly amazing seeing him up close.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.490
I'm sorry.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.670
Don't worry about it. 
That was a tough break. Next, next!

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.480
How high can he jump?

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.480
Right.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.030
Awesome.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:31.960
Good going, Asahi.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.490
And he hasn't played in a month.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.860
Hey, you! 
Your form was all wrong for blocking.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.390
If you want to stop the ball, 
 hold your arms like this!

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:40.880
Are you listening?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.810
Like this.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.960
Hey.

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.960
We're counting on you for the next one.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.190
He was bathed in sweat.
He looked like he was in anguish,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.090
but the Little Giant kept on jumping.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.750
I couldn't understand it back then,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.100
but that must've been because 
of the faith his teammates had in him.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.100
We're counting on you, Asahi-san.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.800
Because everyone on his 
team believed in him,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.870
because they could count on him,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.070
everyone would connect the 
ball to the little ace.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.780
I'm sure the same goes for Asahi-san.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.960
Hey.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.160
The ace is awesome, huh?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.830
He smashes past it all. Blocker or no 
blocker, it makes no difference to him.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.770
What's the matter?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.780
Nothing.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.130 line:20%
Neighborhood Assoc.     Karasuno

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.320
Cover.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.130
In front, in front.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.340
Left!

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.050
If only I had his height and power.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.800
It's coming from the left, cover the side.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.680
Hinata, go back a little more.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.630
No, no, the Little Giant was 
short, but he was awesome, too.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.260
But...

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.100
It must be nice...

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.690
Hinata!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.990
Hinata.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.520
Oh, he's alive.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.410
Are you all right?

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.540
Are you all right?

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.380
It's his fault, no matter how you 
look at it, for being an airhead.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.590
A-A-A-Ambulance...

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.590
Relax, sensei.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.690
I'm fine, I'm sorry about that.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.710
You sure? Just in case, take a break.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:22.050
Really, I'm fine. I couldn't 
dodge it. It's no big deal.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.030
Besides, I'm used to getting hit in face.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.140
Don't get used to it...

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.650
Why were you distracted 
in the middle of the match?

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.760
Crap... Kageyama isn't yelling at me.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.290
That means he's really angry.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.180
It's like when I slammed 
a serve into the back of his head.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.410
I know why.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.030
The ace is cool.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.670
But your number one use is as a decoy,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:01.930
which is humble and uncool.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.980
You're thinking you could be an ace too,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.940
if only you had height 
and power like Asahi-san.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.010
I wasn't thinking that!

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.400
Or... maybe sort of...

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.390
Once you found out there's an ace, 
not only did you yearn to see him,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.900
not only were you curious about him,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.150
but you were envious of him, weren't you?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.040
Don't think unnecessary things 
in the middle of a match.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.150
So I envy him.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.170
What's wrong with that?

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.880
You're tall. You'd never understand.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.540
Hey.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.300
Hey, volleyball club!

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.760
It's closing time.
Put everything away.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.590
I'm sorry, but please wait
 until the match is finished.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.160
But it's late.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.190
I'll take responsibility for closing up.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.700
It was my fault for interrupting the game,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.680
and yet I got mad at Kageyama.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.870
All right then.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.070
Sorry to have inconvenienced you.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.660
Sensei, I appreciate it.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.020
Thank you very much.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.800
Take-chan, you're awesome.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.170
All right, let's continue.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:12.460
Yeah.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.920 line:20%
Neighborhood Assoc.     Karasuno

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.810
One more!

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.920
Nice serve.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.500
All right, bring it.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.580
Maybe this is the high school team's 
strongest offensive rotation.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.510
We'd better watch out for 
that shrimp's fast attack.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.100
Yes.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.040
Um...

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.390
I'm tossing to this guy next.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.770
Please block him with everything you've got.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.520
I'm tossing to this guy next.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.080
Please block him with everything you've got.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.470
What?

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:58.490
Are you calling us out?

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.520
Yes, I'm calling you out.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.210
Please forgive my cocky attitude.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.180
What an interesting guy.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.140
Okay. You can call me out.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.780
Thanks.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:18.020
What's he thinking?

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.780
A fast attack's only effective 
if they can't see it coming,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.090
but he just revealed the plan to them.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.230
How can shrimpy take them on now?
There's no way.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.740
That's true.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.940
We'll block him for sure.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.950
You might be right, if he has 
to confront them head-on.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.950
Right? We'd better, after that speech.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.720
Damn you, Kageyama, what was that for?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.570
What's the point of telling them
 our next move?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.960
There's no way I can break through 
all these tall blockers.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.510
Right now...

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.720
You can jump well, and you're fast, 
but you're lousy overall.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.680
You'll never be an ace, 
the pillar of the team.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.010
Hey.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.930
That's going a little...

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.840
But!

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.860
As long as I'm here, you're invincible.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.710
Huh?

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.370
Azumane-san's spike has awesome power. 
He can slam past three blockers.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.140
Well, not every time...

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.530
Don't get so rattled!

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:12.440
So how about you, then?

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.740
Whenever I toss to you,

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.400
do you ever get blocked?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.940
Nice serve.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.280
All right.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.390
Nice receive.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:25.880
The blockers are huge...

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.590
Dodge them!

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.010
What else can you do, airhead?

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.430
If I can't break past them...

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.140
then dodge!

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.060
I don't want to be blocked.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.730
I don't want to be stopped.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.990
If there are blockers in front 
of me, there's no way I can win.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.160
I don't have fighting power like the ace.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.130
But...

00:14:58.110 --> 00:14:59.290
As long as I'm here,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.250
you're invincible.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.510
You're no ace.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.690
But with your speed and spring,

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.780
and with my toss, 
you can face any blocker.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.610
The point scored by the ace's slam...

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.850
and the point you scored by dodging...

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.030
are just one point scored.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.530
So you don't wear a crown 
with "ace" written on it.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.610
All you have to do is score lots of points.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.960
That's why our opponents will mark you.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.310
Plus, by acting as a decoy, 
you'll free up other spikers.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.750
Including the ace.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.010
Right?

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.210
Huh? Yeah.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.220
Yeah, that's right.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:51.080
You being a decoy makes a huge difference 
 to our success rate.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.850
Do you still think your position is uncool?

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.510
I don't.

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.240
Huh?

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.160
I don't.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.160
Good.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.250
That last slam was amazing.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.230
I apologize for interrupting practice.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.170
I apologize.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.260
We'll continue the match.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.380
Thank you very much.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.920
All right, let's catch up!

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.860
Yeah.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.540
Sensei.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.940
The last one was successful, but 
don't repeat the same movement.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.160
Those two...

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.390
You mean Hinata-kun and Kageyama-kun?

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.240
Are they from the same junior high?

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.390
Or are they childhood friends 
from elementary school?

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.030
Oh, no. They just got acquainted recently.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.120
They didn't get along at first. 
I heard they were a handful.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.580
Ukai-kun?

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.030
How cruel.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.640
All right.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.750
Neighborhood Assoc.     Karasuno

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.430
These high schoolers are pretty good.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.710
They make us old guys play for real.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.090
Jump floater?

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.880
Hinata.

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.810
Got it.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:18.790
All right.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.010
Take that.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.350
How immature.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.870
What was that?

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.470
That didn't look like a 
particularly forceful serve.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.030
It's a jump floater serve.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.150
By hitting the ball so it doesn't 
spin, it wobbles in its path.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.990
It'll suddenly turn, or drop.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.200
It's like a secret weapon.
That's awesome.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.290
Yamaguchi, the score.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.560
Oh, s-sorry.

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.120
One more!

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.600
Neighborhood Assoc.     Karasuno

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:00.030
All right.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.600
That's four points in a row.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.830
The first-year duo's attack is amazing, 
but receiving is a problem.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.060
Especially the first and second-years.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.010
This is mine, in one shot.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.740
Nice receive.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.150
You won't get away with 
it this time, shrimp.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.570
We got it!

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.490
Crap.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.580
Long time no see.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.370
Nice, Nishinoya.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.530
Suga.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.210
Asahi.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.270 line:20%
Neighborhood Assoc.     Karasuno

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.030
Damn. Sorry, Hinata. I was totally free, too.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.110
Oh, no...

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.230
But that was awesome.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.940
You splendidly led all of us. 
You kind of make me jealous.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.260
I'm counting on you.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.490
Y-Yeah.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.790
Well, if nothing else, 
we sure got to relive our youth.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.310
"Call the toss, ace!"
 That kind of stuff.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:11.780
Youth is great, isn't it?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.860
"As long as I'm here, you're invincible!"
I wish I could say that.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.510
High schoolers are awesome!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.710
You guys make us old folk feel left behind.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.180
S-Sorry.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.840
guys have a long way to go,
but when you pull it together,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.330
you'll probably go far.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.350
Thank you very much.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.100
Thank you!

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.120
Anyway...

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.910
Receiving. We're nothing if we can't receive.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.990
Starting tomorrow, 
you've got rigorous training ahead.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:48.290
Yeah.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.980
Thanks.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.040
Thanks.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.000
And don't forget to stretch.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.370
Stretches!

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.590
Yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.900
Take your time.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.680
Was the receiving that bad?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.010
So bad you're sighing?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.970
No, I'll come back to that later.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.140
Back in the day when I'd wait to be picked 
as player, I didn't even realize

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.300
that it isn't easy being the picker.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:20.650
Equipment Room

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.590
Let's clean up fast.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.650
Yeah.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.860
Yamaguchi, put the balls over there.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.680
Asahi-san.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.080
I'm no ace,

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:33.670
but I can carve a path for the ace.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.210
I'll be the most formidable decoy.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.310
A-although I can't do that 
without Kageyama's toss.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:45.970
So...

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.010
So... um...

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.020
"Please do your best." 
No, that doesn't sound right.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.440
"Let's do our best together." 
That sounds kind of cocky...

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.440
Hinata.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.520
That's your name, right? For the most part,

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.480
the player in position to the left 
of the spiker is called "ace."

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.140
Like me and Tanaka ...

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.180
Yes.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.230
Blasting past a triple-block,
 handling the toss in a crucial place,

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.540
those things certainly are the ace's job.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.450
But with your speed and spring,

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.550
and with my toss, 
you can face any blocker.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.750
For a setter to say things 
like that to you...

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.760
I think it's an amazingly awesome thing.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.990
Um... so... um... I dunno...

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.330
but whatever your position is called,

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.470
I think the coolest player is the one 
who is most feared by the opposing team.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.130
Don't you?

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.430
"That middle blocker is dangerous, 
be careful!" That kind of thing.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.990
I'll do my best, too.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.100
Yeah.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.940
Ofcourse, that's if they allow 
me back in as a regular.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.010
Asahi, you're big but so cowardly.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.260
I think you've revived too, Suga.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.710
I'm sorry for all my whimpering 
and groaning and sniveling.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.220
That's not what I meant...

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.150
We also have dependable Nishinoya back.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:14.910
Yeah.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.410
But don't knock the dean 
over ever again, okay?

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:20.850
Which reminds me,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.450
a goofball wing-spiker, 
nominally our ace, has come back, too.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.070
All right. Let's huddle up 
and finish practice.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.460
Karasuno...

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.470
Fight.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.300
Yeah.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.090

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.390
Training camp, at last.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.750
Yeah. Under the same roof 
with Kiyoko-san... Ryu!

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.850
Noya-san!

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:21.700
Ryu!

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.600
Noya-san!

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.930
Wh-What is going on?

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.940
Just ignore them.
