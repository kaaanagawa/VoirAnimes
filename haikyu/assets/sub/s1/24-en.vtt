One-hand toss!

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.000
All right!

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.630
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.170
They're tied!

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.630
They caught up in the eleventh hour!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.940
What was this called again?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.630
A deuce!

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.760
The one to get a two-point lead...

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.380
...wins!

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.070
Haikyu!!

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.680

Seijoh!

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.990
Oh, Seijoh!

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.130
Don't panic! Make sure you call out!

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.880
Right!

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.580
You got this, right, Kunimi-chan?

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.340
Yes.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.050
Hey! That was awesome, Hinata, Kageyama!

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.310
So Kunimi can also chase the ball now...

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.820
Go after it, to the very end!

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.860
Kitagawa Daichi

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.780
Kageyama!

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.120
I'm going to go for as many
 broad attacks as possible,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.150
until I make one!

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.000
Let's go!

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.920
Right!

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.280
Nice serve!

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.280
We've got the momentum!

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.010
Give it all you've got, Tanaka!

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.530
All right! Bring it!

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.930
Got it!

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.930
It's a little off!

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.710
Center!

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.140
Block! Block!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.250
Chance ball!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.900
Chance ball!

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.230
One more!

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.910
Nice receive, Watari!

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.200
#10 is super-fast at returning.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.990
Nice one touch!

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.960
One more time!

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.180
There's no point in leaving you open,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.460
if I know you're gonna jump!

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.600
Hinata's jumps are running out of power!

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.870
The timing's going to be off!

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.860
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.360
All right!

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.860
Shoyo!

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.040
Hinata really saved us on that one!

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.040
That was awesome! Great job!

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.750
This time...

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.390
We're gonna finish this in one shot!

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.590
...Karasuno is the one checkmating.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.070
Let's calm down. We'll get it back!

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.170
Right!

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.930
Tanaka, one more nice serve!

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.540
Hanamaki-san!

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.090
All right!

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.970
Aoba Johsai                     Karasuno

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.380
Even if they're tied, as long 
as Seijoh doesn't pull ahead,

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.120
Karasuno will have the advantage.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.190
Now...

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.630
And now, it's time for 
Oikawa to serve again...

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.240
I won't let you guys attack as you wish.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.820
We're going to win.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.720
We're going to the next round.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.460
Shiratorizawa                       Kitagawa Daichi

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.460
This time,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.300
we're going to crush Shiratorizawa.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.740
One more, and we'll regain the advantage!

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.150
Nishinoya!

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.690
Good call, Nishinoya!

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.410
Right.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.830
He missed... Oikawa missed the serve.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.290
Aoba Johsai                      Karasuno

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.290
Karasuno's at match point again.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.150
If he missed a serve, when that's

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.330
his strong suit, maybe he's panicking a bit.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.760
Yeah. Even Oikawa...

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.180
And that nullified it. 
We each have one point now.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.700
Iwaizumi-san, you're so cool!

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.500
I feel like I've lost to Iwa-chan.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.640
When the hell did you ever beat me?!

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.360
Usually, the weight of a point from a break 
or a side out would be heavier.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.360
Overall, I'm always a winner.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:22.710
Ow!

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.710
However, right now, the important thing is,

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.370
All right. Let's get one.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.290
Right!

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.950
because of Iwaizumi's point and words,

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.080
the team was just saved from crumbling.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.250
Are you sure Seijoh's 
never been to nationals?

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.810
They're not breaking at all.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.710
But that doesn't change 
Seijoh's position at all.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:48.510
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.840
Even if the physical fatigue 
they're feeling is the same,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.900
the mental fatigue that Seijoh 
is feeling is much greater!

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.260
Get through this, Karasuno!

Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.580
Wow...

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.840
They went over 30 points!

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.500
This is rough on both of them.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.620
But... I think Karasuno is 
just barely keeping it together.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.260
I think their attacks are 
becoming simple, too.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.480
Seijoh should be worse off, 
mentally, but...

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.350
Oikawa-kun, nice serve!

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.940
Gah! That was one full rotation!

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:45.940
Nice serve!

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.730
He'll probably have 
the missed serve on his mind,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.900
One point!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.400
so I wonder how Oikawa will do.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.410
Oikawa, if you're staring at Ushiwaka's 
face during the match, I'll punch you.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.580
Someone who can't see the opponent
 standing right in front him,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.040
can't defeat the opponent that lies beyond!

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.220
You're right.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.520
We'll turn this serve around!

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.180
Right!

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.390
Spring High School Volleyball

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.940

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.440
It's coming back! Chance ball!

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.340
Got it!

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.220
Despite the fact that he just messed up,

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.800
that was probably the best 
serve he's done today.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.820
Damn it! Sorry!

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.510
I'm glad you were even able
 to put that serve up!

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.200
Calm down, calm down...

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.200
Got it!

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.480
Make sure you don't jump at a decoy!

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.140
Is it going to be a quick?

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.940
Or, considering the situation,
will it be an ace?

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:08.940
Left!

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:11.860
The opposite side?!

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.070
Again...

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:15.900
It's Kunimi?!

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.020
Kunimi!

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.020
Even if you know it's a decoy, 
hit it over like you mean it.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.060
But it was way obvious that they 
were going to come up the left.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.420
There's no point in getting 
tired for no reason.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.790
You're good, so why don't you play seriously?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.300
So does always being reckless 
equal being serious?

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.020
Chance ball!

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.970
Got it!

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.190
They still have energy to spare?

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.520
Kunimi-chan, you just skipped out 
on being decoy didn't you?

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.280
I'm sor—

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.480
Skip out a bit better.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.440
Mizoguchi-kun's gonna yell at you again.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.620
Kunimi, you idiot!

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.710
Being efficient, conserving energy,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.020
and always being calm are your 
hidden weapons, Kunimi-chan.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.270
But when everyone else is exhausted,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.360
I'll make sure you work even harder.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.670
You're only the setter if you can bring out 
100% of </i>all<i> your teammates' ability.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.250
No matter who the player is!

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.390
#13 again?!

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.060
A feint?!

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.440
Aoba Johsai                    Karasuno

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.440
Seijoh pulled ahead!

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.860
Seijoh's at matchpoint again!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.530
Not to mention, Oikawa is serving again!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:51.080
Just one more point! Just one more point!

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.240
We were on the same team for three years,

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.720
but today's the first time

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.620
I've ever seen him laugh normally during a match.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.680
Hey, just listen...

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.080
Who the hell

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.950
are you?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.210
How am I supposed to face someone like you?

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.210
Kageyama...

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:58.950
Kageyama...

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.550
Kageyama-kun...

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.930
Kageyama-san!

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.630
Hey, are you freaking out? How lame!

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.770
Well, it's obivious that the Great King 
is going to be better than the King.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.810
It's in the names!

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.000
Not to mention, he seems 
way smarter than you.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.240
Sorry, Kageyama!

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.990
I'll make sure I get the ball
 back to you next time.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:28.530
Then, all you need to do is 
the attack you think is best.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.460
Kageyama! Stop hesitating!

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.420
Everyone on our team is...

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.110
...strong, as they should be.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:49.280
Do you think the King is 
scared of the Great King?

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.800
It's okay.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.680
Kageyama's not the Lonely King anymore.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.470
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.430
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.430
Come on, bring it!

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.980
Push it, push it, push it! 
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.100
Bring it!

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.850
We're gonna get that point!

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.580
Push it, push it, push it! 
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:31.310
Yeah!

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.730
Man...

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.940
Talk about annoying.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.150
Nice serve!

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.070
Tobio...

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.780
One point!

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.030
I might actually lose to you,

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.390
Come on, bring it!

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.050
considering how quickly you evolve.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.410
But...

00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:59.510
Front!

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.000
It went up!

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.760
But it's messed up! 
They won't be able to use a quick!

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.540
In this tense situation, 
he still managed to find the smallest gap

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.430
and pulled off a feint.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.980
His calm focus on victory is terrifying.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.040
Left!

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.040
Center!

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.380
Left!

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.190
Asahi, go!

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.570
Connect! Connect!

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.050
Iwa-chan!

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.200
It went u— Ah!

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:27.910
Do it, Kindaichi!

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.660
My speed and reflexes always lose to you.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:32.370
But...

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.240
But in a battle of height...

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.670
I won't lose!

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.010
It went up!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.670
All right!

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.540
Kindaichi, Kunimi!

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.330
Right!

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.690
Left!

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.850
Now! In this position, with this timing,

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.310
this angle...

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.800
Dead on!

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.910
Tobio...

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.820
I might actually lose to you,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.300
considering how quickly you evolve.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.200
But...

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.610
That won't be today!

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.690
All right!

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:52.450
Let's go.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.830
Hinata, Kageyama, we need to line up.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.820
Captain, I'm sor—

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.050
That wasn't a mistake.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.590
It wasn't a mistake, so don't apologize.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.060
Thank you very much!

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:42.500
Everyone, just listen.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.900
The next time that Karasuno looks 
like they're going to use a quick,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.500
Tobio will use the god-like quick.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.630
Keep that in your heads.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.750
How did you know the last one 
would be a god-like quick?

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:57.850
Because Tobio evolved thanks to 
all of the players in Karasuno.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.060
He's starting to learn how 
to trust for the first time.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.980
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.980
When the deuces continued,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.690
his physical and mental 
fatigue were at their peak.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.360
In the eleventh hour, 
when they were cornered,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.960
it was then they were given a crucial chance.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.610
At that moment, Tobio...

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.980
only had one choice.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.620
Line up!

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.800
Thank you very much!

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.920
Thank you very much!

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:36.430
Great work!

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.640
That was a great match!

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.270
Round up!

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.190
When we lost...

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.770
I hated being told we had a great match.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.030
It was like, "but we lost."

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.850
However, being on the side to say that now,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.980
I guess I don't know what else to say.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.760
Um, that last block...

00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:16.110
We need to clear out immediately.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:18.560
The next team's warm-up is starting.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.230
We'll start our cool down 
upstairs or outside.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.810
Seijoh will be going to the 
quarterfinals after a short break.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.680
"Even if one person is good, 
you can't win. Don't mind."

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.420
Isn't that what you were going to tell them?

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.010
But Karasuno had more than one 
strong player, didn't they?

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.490
You're really annoying.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:57.340
How rude!

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.490
The end of that second set...

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.770
When he was able to read my toss to you,

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.940
I could tell that Tobio was trying to go

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.350
from being a dictator to a decent king.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.080
Even if Tobio had stayed a dictator,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.230
he might have still tossed 
to the shrimp in the end.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.360
I only thought it was a possibility,

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.490
and there was no guarantee 
he was going to do it.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.950
He was reading my attacks, but this time,

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.840
he ended up having his 
attack being read by me.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.030
So Kageyama has finally 
started trusting other people...

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.420
Really...

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.390
Nothing could be more troublesome.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.560
The meeting's starting.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:01.450
Sorry.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.700
They totally read me in the end.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.270
Don't apologize!

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.470
Don't... Don't make it sound like 
tossing to me was a mistake!

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.160
The meeting's about to start.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.600
Both of you were amazing today.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:36.190
But we lost...

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.020
Indeed, we lost.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.290
But it was a worthwhile match, wasn't it?

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.250
Does losing prove that you're weak?

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.540
Isn't losing difficult for all of you?

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.900
A challenge where, after ending 
up on your hands and knees,

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.980
you must see if you can stand-up again?

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.520
If you stay on your hands and knees,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.030
that proves that you are weak.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.010
Senseki                              Aoba Johsai

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.070
All right, let's go get some food.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.410
Of course, I'm paying.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.680
Eh? Food? But...

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.480
Just shut up and eat.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.920
Closed

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.920
Izakaya
<font size="20" color="#582a21">Osuwari</c>

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.390
Sorry, Ma'am, for coming in 
right before you open up.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:16.350
Don't worry. This used 
to happen all the time.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.730
Running, jumping, and anything else

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.660
that stresses your muscles 
will cause the fibers to tear.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.870
Right after a match, like now, 
your muscle are at their limits,

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.040
so you've got to repair them by eating.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.540
That's how you build muscle,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.460
and become stronger.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:44.510
So eat. Eat a proper meal.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.450
Th-Thank you for the food.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:50.970
Thank you for the food.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.050
Thank you for the food.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:55.470
Enjoy!

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.860
Thank you for the food.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.440
Eat.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.560
Eat...

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:38.500
A little at a time.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.020
But, be sure...

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.760
...to grow stronger.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.000
Next Episode Preview

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.980
Ukai-kun, I'll cover this...

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.160
Don't worry about it!

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.340
Hey, Ma'am, can I get the check?

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.290
Here you go. I gave you quite a discount.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.190
Thank you!

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:09.360
Gah! Those guys ate a lot!
