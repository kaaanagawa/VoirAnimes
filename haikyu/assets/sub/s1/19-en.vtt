00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.750
What? Again?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.210
That's his fourth aced serve in a row.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.170
Aoba Johsai                            Omisaki

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.040
His power goes without saying, 
but that control is pretty nasty, too.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.900
But if they can do something 
about that serve...

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.640
It's true that his serves are scary,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.850
but Oikawa, as a setter,
 is completely unknown to us.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.350
One more! Nice serve!

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.860
Sorry!

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.530
Chance ball!

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.840
Got it!

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.950
Okay.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.240
You know, setters...

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.660
are like orchestra conductors.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.890
Even if you have the same 
song and same orchestra,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.550
if the conductor is different,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.790
the sound is different.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.030
Haikyu!!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.440

Rule the Court
<font size="15">Aoba Johsai High School Volleyball Club</c>

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.780
How do I put this... 
They've got a very smooth transition.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.410
Oikawa-san and Iwaizumi-san, 
that #4 on the left.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.870
Apparently those two have been on 
the same team since grade school.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.390
They're linked, both mentally and physically.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.010
I don't really think the second-year setter's
 level was lower in the practice match.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.270
I mean, they're in Seijoh.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.840
Right.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.800
I think it's just that
Oikawa knows everything

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.650
there is to know about Seijoh's team,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.650
Oikawa, one more!

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.360
Nice serve!

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.810
and is helping them bring out their A-game.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.230
The Great King is so awesome!

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.740
I want to hurry up and play him!

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.440
Yeah! I hope he aims his serves at me!

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.520
I totally want to get them!

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.350
Noya-san's awesome, too!

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.530
Well, isn't that promising...

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.760
Hey, look, Shoyo!

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.040
A TV crew's here!

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.460
TV?! Awesome! I wanna be on TV, too!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.860
Hey, now...

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.280
You two junior high—

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.710
Maybe you're grade school kids? 
Quiet down a little.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.770
Grade...

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.200
Sorry...

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.390
Aoba Johsai                            Omisaki

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.390
It's so quiet.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.580
Everyone's out cold.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480
Well, they did play two matches.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.500
Plus they won both straight-set wins,
 so that's not bad.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.840
If they keep winning starting tomorrow,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.410
not only will they have two matches a day,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.180
but their opponents
 will continue to get stronger.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.600
We'll have to bolster 
their morale every time.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.540
Right.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.290
All right, we're going to have a meeting.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.650
Right.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.110
Takeda-sensei!

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.320
The volleyball club is on TV!

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.530

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.000
Oh!

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.040

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.250
were held, and heated matches ensued.

First, in the I Block,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.100
we have the ace player, Ushijima Wakatoshi-kun,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.790
leading the reigning champions at 
 Shiratorizawa Academy in their first game.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.680
They played against Oginnami High School, 
winning 25 to 10 in their first set,

and 25 to 6 in their second set,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.410
not giving their opponents the 
slightest chance against them.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.540
They showed everyone why 
they're the reigning champions.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.530
25 to 6?

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.990
Will they be able to make it 
to nationals once again

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.200
or will a team appear that can stop them?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.540
It'll be worth seeing.

A player you should definitely watch out 
for is Aoba Johsai High School's

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.580
team captain, Oikawa Toru-kun.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.420
His dashing good looks draw in female fans,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.060
so he's a player with both skill 
and popularity to spare.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.820
Oikawa-san! So cute!

Tomorrow, going up against Aoba Johsai

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.790
is a team that sped to an unbelievable
 straight-set victory against Date Tech

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.900
—who were expected to place
 in the tournament's top eight—

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.440
the powerhouse, Karasuno High School.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.490
We're gonna be on!

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.270
We asked him what he thought about 
his opponent, Karasuno High School,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.940
who he'll be facing in the third match.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:44.130
Q: What do you think of your opponents for the third match?

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.670
They're a great team.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.660
I hope...

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.130
...they go for broke.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.980
There'll definitely be more 
heated matches tomorrow.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.550
We wish them the best.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.840
Next is the weather.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.120
We have Komata-san reporting 
from Sendai Station.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.740
Hello, Komata here.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.450
Th-There was a glimpse of your 
match at the very beginning!

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.610
You all looked very cool!

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.350
Sensei, thank you.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.770
Oh, it was nothing...

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.770
All right. Well, then...

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.810
Let's do this.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.480
Do what?!

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.780
A m-meeting!

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.490
Today's match against Date Tech

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.460
is what you call "the first sip of beer."

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.150
The deliciousness of the
first sip of beer is special,

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.590
and you only 
get it in that first sip.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.550
Ukai-kun, we should phrase that
 differenty for the minors here.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.760
Ahem.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.810
Well, the match with Date Tech
 was the first time

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.980
we used the freak quick against them.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.480
Therefore, we were able to 
catch out opponents off guard.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.140
But we've fought Seijoh once in the past,

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.820
so they know at least some of our tricks.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.910
Still, I'm certain that your offense 
is stronger than theirs.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.320
First, we need to endure Oikawa's serves.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.120
His serves controlling the game's pace

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.080
is what we want the least,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.090
but that's most likely that will happen.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.240
So, for right now, we have the basic

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.800
"everyone who's not the setter goes after 
the ball" formation to receive serves.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:21.480
(Net)
 Hinata or Tsukishima

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.790
However, this time, we won't have the 
middle blocker, Hinata or Tsukishima,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.790
participate in receiving the serve.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.480
They'll concentrate solely on attacking.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.950
'Kay.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.840
Okay.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.600
Hey, don't get so bummed out.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.110
We're just dividing up the work.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:34.030
Oh, also, you guys saw Seijoh and thought, 
"Oh, crap. They're strong," right?

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:36.870
But...

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.200
If you were seeing our match against Date Tech
 from the stands, you'd hesitate, saying,

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.960
"What's with that blocking? 
Talk about scary. We can't win," right?

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.380
But you fought them,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.840
and you won.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.850
Tomorrow will be the same.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.680
All right!

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.980
All right. Let's clarify the formation a bit.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.180
Right!

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.840
Ukai-san.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.580
Oh, Mori.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.880
This is today's match.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.910
Seijoh vs Omisaki

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.390
Sweet. Thanks.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.110
Thanks.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.910
This helps out a lot. 
The next round's on me.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.580
All right! Yeah!

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.730
See ya.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.730
Is that the Aoba Johsai match?

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:28.600
Yeah.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.490
Well, it's not like watching 
this will guarantee

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:36.220
Seijoh vs 
Omisaki

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.700
we'll be able to receive 
Oikawa's serves tomorrow.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.800
But I'd feel pretty anxious
 if I wasn't doing <i>anything</i>.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.550
The next round's on me, Ukai-kun.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:43.560
Seriously?!

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.240
All right. Make sure 
you're not late tomorrow.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.570
Right!

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.560
I want to take my dear underclassman
 on in an official match,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.950
setter versus setter, and crush him.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.550
Kageyama seems more irritated than usual.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.720
Oh, there he goes.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.650
Kageyama!

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.090
You're going to end up with

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.930
permanent forehead wrinkles, 
even though you're just a teen!

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.470
What?!

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.390
Tomorrow, we're going to 
defeat the Great King....

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.020
Defeat... Oikawa-san...

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.640
...and end up on TV, so you should
 practice looking good for that!

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.820
Mind your own business!

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:39.730
We'll win that match. 
If we don't, we can't advance.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.980
All right!

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.940
I'll be going, now.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.110
'Kay. Bye-bye!

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.270
Hey, make sure you don't stay up all night.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.560
Iwa-chan, are you my mom?

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.110
What?

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.380
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
I promise I won't!

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.570
I promise I'll arrive in top condition!

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.620
Stop being stupid, Crappy Oikawa.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.940
I'm shutting the club room doors, 
so get out of here, Trashykawa.

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.250
Don't shorten the insults!

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.180
Trashy Oikawa!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.160
You don't have to rephrase it!

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.770
Is it possible that this player...

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.060
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.560
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.150
Push it, push it, push it! 
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:12:53.150 --> 00:13:03.320
Push it, push it, push it! 
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.340
Let's play.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.300
Let's play.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.760
Fly

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.760
Looks like Karasuno made it 
safely through to day two.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.090
I ended up using another paid day off.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.210
I'm not gonna be able to take 
another day off for a while.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.210
Same here.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.690
Rule the Court

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.540
Date Tech had quite the crowd 
cheering for them, too,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.250
but these guys...

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.690
Ready, and...

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.940
Oikawa-kun! Do your best!

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.650
They've got that.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.740
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose! Let's go!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.620
Yeah!

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.850
Come on, louder! It's like Seijoh's 
the only team on the court!

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.850
We're going to be serving first.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:34.580
Right.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.130
Right!

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.100
Ready, and...

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.710
Oikawa-senpai! Do your best—

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.420
Karasuno!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.320
Fight!

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.180
Yeah!

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.250
Fight!

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:48.920
Fight!

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.650
Fight!

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.100
Next, we'll do serves!

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.100
They sure are pumped up.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.590
Right!

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.880
By the way, did your student 
get better at serves?

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.940
What do you mean, "student"?

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.150
Will you teach me how to do 
a jump float serve?

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.670
It's only been a week since then.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.300
Here I go!

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.090
He may be able to get some lucky hits in,

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.580
but he can't really control it yet.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.920
Nice, Makki. Super sharp.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.650
Sorry, Kindaichi.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.520
That one was a little high.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.220
Uh, no... Yes!

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.640
Iwa-chan, you sure you're 
not trying too hard?

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.290
You don't have to try and show off.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.570
None of the girls will 
be looking at you, anyway.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.590
Oikawa-kun is apparently watching 
the other players very closely.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.400
I-Iwasaki-san! Calm down! 
We're right before a match!

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.040
Let go of me, Kindachi!

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.720
I don't understand all of 
the technical stuff yet,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.920
Now's not a good time! See? 
Everyone's staring hard!

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.120
but I can see that the team 
seems to be in good shape.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.540
I don't care. I'm gonna hit him.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.890
Hey! What are you saying?!

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.410
Iwaizumi-san, calm down!

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.960
You think so?

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.380
Aoba Johsai                          Karasuno

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.050
Line up!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.080

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.940
I'm going up against him in an 
official match for the first time.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.320
Let's play!

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.090
Hey, it's starting.
The third match, huh?

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.530
If they win, they'll be in the top eight!

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:17.740
I wonder who'll win.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.000
It's definitely going to be Aoba Johsai.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.420
Hey, Tobio-chan.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.420
I came here excited to take 
down the genius setter,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.880
so do your best, and hold on.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.450
We will win—

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.470
We won't lose!

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.810
Don't butt in when I'm talking,
 Hinata, you jackass!

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.270
We won't...

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.380
...lose this time, either!

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.820

Push it, push it, push it!
Push it, push it, Seijoh!

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.450
have already defeated Aoba Johsai once.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.700
Even if our opponents were not 
at their best at the time,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.460
I believe the fact that we won

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.420
is enough reason to have confidence.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.000
Not conceit, but confidence.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Right!

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.740
Karasuno... Fight!

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.220
Yeah!

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.110
All right. Let's do this.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:17.800
Now then, as usual...

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.270
I believe in all of you.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.690
I think...

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.650
...the atmosphere around Aoba Johsai 
just changed suddenly.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.770
The one line he always says before a match...

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.210
When he says it, 
it almost sounds like a joke,

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.500
and yet it almost sounds like a threat.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.220
However, because everyone knows that,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.070
there is no underlying 
meaning behind those words.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.460
They can all trust in him to the utmost.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.590
Let's go!

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.510
Yeah!

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.080
Tsukishima, nice serve!

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:38.700

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.280
Right!

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.140
Nice recieve!

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.610
Two of the guys in the front line jumped out!

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.470
Who will they use?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.930
All right.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.140
It's been a while since I've seen 
Oikawa-san's set up so close.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.160
I...

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.490

Well, well...

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.880
That was a rather bold dump...

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:21.400
Come on. I'll be doing the same thing again.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.850
Don't stand there so out of it.
Pay attention.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.090
H-He said he'd do that again,

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.210
but is he telling the truth?

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.770
I guess someone wouldn't 
usually do that again...

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.430
Then again, he could realize 
we'd think that and do it again.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.400
I see! Tanaka-san, you're amazing!

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:42.420
Hey, now. There's no point 
in dwelling on that.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.770
It's the same as trying to 
figure out what your opponent

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.740
will throw out in rock-paper-scissors.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.330
Right!

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.710
Nice serve, Matsukawa!

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.170
All right!

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.210

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:57.540
B!

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.420
Come to me!

Hey, it's #10.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.260
Is it coming?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.100
There it is! It's so fast!

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.960
It's dead-on!

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.440
Hey, is the Seijoh setter 
going to try a dump again?

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.660
He's being even more obvious this time!

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.360
Don't underestimate me!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.070
He went from a spike formation straight into

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.830

But Iwa-chan,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.540
you usually hit it regardless.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.140
Wow...

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.510
That's slightly infuriating, but wow...

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.010
So cool!

Oikawa-senpai!

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.860
Well, he's an even more troublesome 
opponent than I thought...

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.740
Indeed.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.190
It's true that we won the 
practice match the other day,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.070
but now that this team has 
their conductor to lead them,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.790
they're something else entirely.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:03.850
Damn it...

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.410
Hey, hey, hey...

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.740
You knew that Oikawa was 
amazing to begin with.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.150
Our setter is just as skilled, 
and his attacks

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.560
are just as flashy.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.280
Right!

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.920

H...

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.390
He got them back with a dump!

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.200
He sure hates losing, doesn't he?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.470
Do it again!
