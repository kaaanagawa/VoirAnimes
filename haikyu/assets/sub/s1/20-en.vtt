00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.620
When I got into junior high, 
there was an amazing player.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.260
I thought that junior high 
was an amazing place,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.060
Best Setter Award 
 Oikawa Toru

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.070
but that wasn't exactly the case...

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.030
It was that person who was amazing.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.530
Certain Victory
 Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High School Volleyball Club

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.250
If I could surpass him,

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.030
I'd be the best setter in the prefecture.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.710
Dang... Karasuno's setter 
is only a first-year,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.170
but he's going head-to-head with Oikawa.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.800
This is totally a battle of the setters.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.640
That was awesome!

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.220
You're not losing against 
the Great King, Kageyama!

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.570
Even if he's the best 
overall player in the prefecture,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.870
I won't lose to him as a setter.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.020
But aren't you serving next?

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.430
You're on the back line, right?

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.470
You said you'd do the same thing again,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.900
but isn't a dump from the 
back line illegal?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.890
Shut up!

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.100
I-I meant when I got back 
up to the front line.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.020
Haikyu!!

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.970
Aoba Johsai                           Karasuno

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.140
Episode 20: Oikawa Toru is Not a Genius

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.000
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.060
Crap!

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.440
Out! Out!

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.780
He sure blew that one out of the park.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.360
What an amazing homerun.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.990
Damn it!

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.670
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.660
I'm sorry.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.620
Well, then.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.780
I guess I'll just have to show
 you how it's done.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.550
Eh? He was aiming for Nishinoya?!

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.140
It's coming head-on... 
no, it's curving!

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.390
He was able to receive Oikawa's serve!

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.850
Karasuno's libero's awesome!

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.960
Aww...

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.310
He got it.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.870
Aw, man. He really is amazing.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.620
Whadya mean, "show you how it's done"?!

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.280
He received it without a problem!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.700
Bring it!

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.200
#10! #10!

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.830
Yeah!

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.830
All right!

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.440
You just saw the guy on 
the right, didn't you?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.040
Yeah.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.920
Nekoma's setter tried to trick people 
using his eyes, didn't he?

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.630
That god-like toss should 
be against the rules. Jeez.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.600
I'm impressed that Nishinoya-kun 
was able to receive that cleanly.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.870
Oh, but maybe Oikawa-kun didn't mean 
to hit it toward Nishinoya-kun.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.760
No, I think he was aiming for Nishinoya.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.070
Well done!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.970
If Nishinoya wasn't able to get that,

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.020
Thanks!

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.130
the damage to everyone else's morale
 would have been huge.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.600
Do that one more time!

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.880
I think that's what he wanted.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.440
Thank goodness.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.270
You did a great job receiving that, Nishinoya.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.540
I'm sorry. I keep messing up.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.530
Well, they are the Karasuno 
that toyed with Date Tech.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.000
Let's just wait a bit.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.710
It shouldn't be much longer.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.820
More importantly, Kindaichi...

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.370
I'm sure that you're rather frustrated

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.870
that the role of Kayeyama's partner 
was stolen by that little shrimp.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.510
No, not really...

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.650
It's fine. Don't sweat it.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.920
Even if Tobio thought of you

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.610
as a minion that wasn't 
very useful in junior high,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.060
I, the great Oikawa-san, 
will prove that you're amazing,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.780
even without using god-like quicks.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.540
So don't worry and just jump.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.890
Right!

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.560
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.520
Nice serve!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.070
Watari!

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.070
Got it!

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.130
Nice recieve!

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.120
Center!

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.390
A-quick!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.960
Rule the Court
<font size="15">Aoba Johsai High School Volleyball Club</c>

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.980
Go, go, Yutaro!

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.380
Push it, push it, Yutaro! One more!

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.510
I wonder... Maybe I'm imagining it...

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.790
Their #12 seems to be jumping higher

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.470
than in our practice match.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.440
Aoba Johsai                           Karasuno

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.730
Iwa-chan, nice serve!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.900
Sorry! Cover!

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:40.360
Right!

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.690
Toss to me!

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.280
Yep.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.200
Sensei! Sensei!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.750
Aoba Johsai                           Karasuno

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.650
Seijoh's already asking for a timeout?

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.640
Isn't it a bit early?

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.720
It wasn't like Karasuno had 
momentum or anything.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.180
I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.890
It's "bring it" and "to me."

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.470
Could it be that they've
 already figured it out?

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.100
Damn it, that was fast.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.780
At first, I noticed that the shrimp 
would always yell something

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.230
when he'd move in on the ball,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.070
and I thought he seemed pretty stupid.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.690
But when they use that 
god-like quick attack,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.030
it appears they're using "bring it,"
 like "bring it here"

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.740
or "bring it to me."

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.500
And with a normal one...

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.150
...they're using "to me."

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.790
Yep.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.860
But that shrimp's role is to be the decoy.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.650
They want us to focus our attention on him.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.970
So let's just set up a simple rule.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.900
When we hear "bring it," let's just 
have one person mark the shrimp.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.930
When we hear "to me," let's see 
where the toss goes before we jump.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.240
Okay?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.120
Right!

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.860
Considering we took a timeout this early
 when nothing's really happened yet,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.100
don't you think they realized that 
we've realized what they're doing?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.560
That's completely fine.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.840
It's actually better if they realize it.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.370
If they know that we've realized 
they're using those signals,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.000
it might be minimal, but Tobio will panic.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.150
Hey! What's with the serious face? 
That's not like you.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.960
Nah, Noya-san. That's actually 
how he always looks.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.080
He has the same face when

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.990
he's trying to decide between 
milk a yogurt drink.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.680
That— He— That has nothing 
to do with anything!

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.890
But Noya-san, I'm amazed that you 
were able to return that serve.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.070
I received that serve once 
when I was in junior high.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.150
It was always an amazing serve, 
if he could actually get it in,

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.240
but he missed it a lot, and it 
didn't have as much control.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.520
I'm sure he practiced a lot.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.200
Just because they have one 
guy who can serve really well

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.870
and their setter is an all-around player,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.830
I don't think those are the only reasons 
they've stayed in the top four for so long.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.420
If we let our guard down, 
they'll take this game.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.430
Let's give it our all!

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.440
Right!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.390
All right!

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.510
What the hell kind of sound was that?!

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.100
Don't look down, even if you miss.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.960
All right. Let's go ahead with our plan.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.560
Kindaichi, you know where to aim, right?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.180
Yes!

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.680
One point!

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.390
No matter how great a set up may be,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.630
it only exists because of the first receive.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.510
Kindaichi, nice serve!

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.700
Oh? That didn't look like 
a very strong serve.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.370
Sorry! We'll get the next one!

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.440
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.950
All right!

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.660
It's really hard to get.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.370
It seems...

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.080
They're trying to get the setter 
from the back line to come out.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.170
That wasn't like Oikawa-kun's serve, 
so why can't they get it?

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.070
Ahem. Well, that's because...

00:08:53.630 --> 00:09:01.810
Back line                       Front line

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.590
When the setter is in the back line,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.950
he can't move in front of 
the players on the front line

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.120
until after the serve is hit.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:08.610
Back line                       Front line

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.690
So when they serve the ball,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.610
they have to rush toward 
the net at the same time.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.790
If they happen to to serve right 
where this mixing of people occurs,

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.990
they tend to receive late
 and it's easy to miss.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.950
But as soon as they know where it's going...

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.190
Kindaichi, nice serve!

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.180
Yeah!

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.660
...it's not an impossible serve to get.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.450
Nice receive!

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.920
All right!

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.330
So they're thinking about 
a lot of things while playing...

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.960
Thank you, old guy.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.300
"Old." Sure.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.340
Ah, looks like Oikawa-kun is back up front.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.760
#3! #3!

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.220
They'll have to be careful 
of that dump attack again.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.230
Nice serve!

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.490
Damn it...

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.600
This pressure's incredible.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.000
They're now four points ahead of us,

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.970
and we have two blockers 
on the front row without Hinata.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.770
We have to hurry up the rotation.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.540
Nice receive!

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.320
A dump!

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.040
There's nothing easier to stop than a 
dump when you're panicked.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.670
Aoba Johsai                           Karasuno

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.550
Yeah!

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.150
Yeah!

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.970
Let's turn this around and 
get those four points back.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.130
Yeah!

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.720
They're so lively...

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.780
...and troublesome.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:28.140
Give me a toss!

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.060
When we hear "give me," 
we look at the toss...

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.530
...and then jump!

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.320
All right!

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.740
Have they realized it, after all?

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.010
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.890
One point!

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.740
I'm not going to miss this time.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.420
Is it a bit too forward?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.980
Front! Front! Front!

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.300
Good. He was able to turn 
it into a soft serve.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.720
I'm not going to give you 
a chance that easily.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.140
Kageyama-kun touched the ball first?

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.790
Now he can't toss!

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.430
Tanaka!

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.410
Damn it!

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.410
To be able to change a tight spot 
into an opportunity so quickly...

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.190
The fact that he's able to 
do that in an actual match...

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.540
His command of the game is amazing.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.370
Don't mind! Don't mind!

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.490
One more!

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.270
Now it's Oikawa-kun's turn to serve again.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.460
Seeing the heavy atmosphere when a team's
 cheerful mood-maker suddenly falls silent...

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.350
I love it!

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.700
Don't mind!
We'll get the next one!

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.160
Continuously missing serve receives 
will apply a lot of pressure.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.120
First, we'll have to quiet 
down the lively baldy,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.610
then the ace.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.830
If we can break the two on the left 
who are the essence of their attack...

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.560
There's no point in having a skilled decoy.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.230
That was fast.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.590
Karasuno's taking a timeout 
right after a fast attack.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.960
Well, the momentum's already with Seijoh,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.850
so if they don't hurry up
and turn the momentum around,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.220
they're not going to be able to come back.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.230
I feel bad for the guy they're targeting.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.800
Just lift it up!

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.000
Even if it doesn't go to the setter, 
as long as we can get the ball up,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.450
we can recover somehow!

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:39.420
Right.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.240
By the way, Kageyama-kun...

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.730
What was with that dump earlier?

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.270
I'm sorry! I panicked!

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.020
If you realize that, it's fine.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.040
It's not that dumps are wrong.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.160
It's also in our favor if we 
have the enemy verify that

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.470
we have a lot of ways to attack.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.200
However, if they read 
that we're doing a dump,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.340
then it's likely that they'll stop it.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.970
Think carefully about when 
you're going to use it.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.060
Yes!

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.600
Also, don't forget who 
we're fighting against.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.930
It's not Oikawa, but Aoba Johsai.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.900
Also, it's not just you that's fighting,

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.020
it's Karasuno.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.470
Right.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.360
Nice serve!

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360
One more!

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.240
It went up!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.920
Rule the Court
<font size="15">Aoba Johsai High School Volleyball Club</c>

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.450
It's okay!
It went up like it should, Tanaka!

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.380
Right.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.960
Ryu!

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.680
Hinata, cover!

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.330
Right!

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.430
Tanaka-san!

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.400
#5! #5!

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.750
Sensei.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.640
Right!

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.850
So they've already used 
both of their timeouts...

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:03.400
Right now, the top priority 
is to stop their momentum.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.490
In volleyball, where making 
the connection is everything,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.290
when you miss receiving
 the serves repeatedly,

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.700
the guilt and loneliness 
you feel is like no other.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.910
And then the final blow that followed...

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.630
Is baldy going to be okay?

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.840
I wonder if I should say something.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.210
Whenever I feel down,

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.780
Tanaka-san always says something.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.970
So maybe I should...

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.690
Um—

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.680
I'm sorry!

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.460
Ryu! There are some things 
that can't be helped!

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.300
That toss was hard, and 
there was a three-person block.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.750
I should have followed up—

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.240
I didn't call the toss just now.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.280
I got scared for a second, damn it!

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.710
I'll have all of my regrets after the match!

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.350
There's no point in someone worthless like me

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.170
bringing everyone down because 
I'm upset about my own mistake!

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.180
I'll get it next time!

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.880
The fact that you're saying that
 shows just how worthy you are.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.510
Oh, right.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.050
If you try to receive by just using 
your arms, it'll just deflect,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.100
so move your legs, too.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.010
You should be just like Ryu, Asahi-san.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.600
If I could, I would!

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.070
Hey, about the timeout they took earlier...

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.170
Didn't that Oikawa guy seem weird?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.780
Yeah. Apparently, it's so 
he doesn't lose his focus.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.450
In order to stop the momentum 
of his dangerous serves,

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.230
most teams usually take a timeout.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.370
Bring it!

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.370
One more! One more!

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.150
Nice serve!

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.020
Damn it. He's concentrating more than ever.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.380
The rest is up to you guys.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.010
Go!

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.660
If it deflects, it's finished!

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.180
I'll receive it!

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.280
That could have hit him in the face!

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.560
Damn it...

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.810
It's falling—

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.830
They returned it!

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.350
And to the best spot!

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:13.410
Watacchi!

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.450
Right! Hanamaki-san!

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.260
Nice receive!

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.370
Sorry! Cover!

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.580
Left!

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.920
Tanaka-san!

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.680
It's not like he doesn't make mistakes,

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.270
and he's quick to let taunts get to him,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.380
but...

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.100
He's the second-strongest after Azumane,
 and most importantly,

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.960
his ability to perform when 
he's cornered doesn't deteriorate.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.420
That mental strength...

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.310
Those are unmistakably...

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.900
...the qualities of an ace.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.160
Karasuno's baldy just managed...

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.620
...to stop Oikawa's momentum...

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.580
Yeah!

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.580
...by himself!

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.440
Tanaka-san!

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.040
And I was planning on taking another 
three or four points, too...

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.310
Ryu!

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.310
Tanaka!

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.990
Nice!

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:05.040
Thanks for the nice 
follow-ups, everyone!

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.550
This is the most I was 
ever able to see a block!

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.510
Some times, I can see the opponent's 
block in slow motion in the air.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.720
It's just like light passing by.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.440
Tanaka-san, you're awesome!

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.850
Well, I am your senpai!

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:23.980
Tanaka, serve!

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.440
Yes!

00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:27.160
We stopped their momentum,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.070
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.070
but this is just the beginning.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.830
The pressure's just starting.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.160
Nice one-touch!

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.930
Chance ball!

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.410
Bring it!

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.720
All right!

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.500
We knew they'd be coming, but that was fast.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.260
Hey! You're not gonna say, 
"I can't toss like him," are you?

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.740
Like Tobio? But I really can't.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.100
I can't pinpoint like that.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.280
Don't get mad!

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.150
Tanaka, nice serve!

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.800
Even if I'm no match for his talent,

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.140
I have confidence that I can set 
the best tosses for everyone.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.830
That's why I won't lose as a setter.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.060
Another one from above the block...

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.060
Kindaichi, nice!

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:18.650
There's no need to be that surprised.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:22.650
Go, go, Yutaro! Push it, push it,
 Yutaro! One more!

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.650
That's where Kindaichi 
always scored the best.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.580
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.550
Front! Front!

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.580
A seven-point lead...

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.730
Nice receive!

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.790
We have to lessen it somehow.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.790
Bring it!

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.420
That seemed to be sharper than usual!

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.800
Damn it. Two blockers. They keep following.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.640
Sorry, I was a little late.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.580
So close! Don't mind! 
You'll get the next one.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.750
If they stop us here, 
they're going to take the momentum again.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.700
Right! I'll do my best!

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.580
I'll somehow have to make it just one...

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.600
When I was a second-year in high school,

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.060
I heard the nickname of my very talented 
underclassman from junior high:

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.420
The King of the Court.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.530
I thought it was high praise,

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.490
but after I saw a match, 
I realized it meant something else.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.490
He has the power.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.740
He has the talent.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.540
He's hungry for victory, 
way more than anyone else.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.080
That's what made Tobio strong,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.290
but also...

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.250
...it was his only weakness.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.750
You try to do everything 
yourself far too much, Tobio.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.800
And that's not an easy habit to break.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.240
Especially after just two months.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.670
Hanamaki, nice kill!

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:29.520
Nice!

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:31.930
Hinata!

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.650
Use the signal we talked about. 
We're changing plans!

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.380
Could it be the new one?

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.200
Cover!

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.410
Matsukawa, nice block!

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.330
All right!

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.780
One more! One more!

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:51.400
Hey. Are Karasuno's attacks getting faster?

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.310
I don't feel good about this acceleration,

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.840
and we've already used up our timeouts.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.630
Take your time! Don't panic!

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.020
The curse of speed...

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.790
When you feel like you 
want to escape from a block,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.020
you end up doing faster tosses 
rather than ones that are easy to hit.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.520
Unconsciously, and just 
a little at a time...

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.980
But that...

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.940
...eventually leads to a giant shift.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.150
Tobio, you're a genius.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.890
You're the only person who could 
use that attack with that shrimp.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.460
But what about everything else?

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.470
If you were able to raise the 
ball a bit slower, I think your #3

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.820
could have enough power 
to spike through the blocks.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.920
Does glasses there trust your tosses 
enough that he could seriously hit them?

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.490
Spikers are all different.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.760
Once you're able to bring out 
100% of the strengths

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.180
of each and every one of them, 
that's when...

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.520
you'll be a true setter!

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.650
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.110
It's no use. The gap's 
not getting any smaller.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.470
Something... I have to do so something.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.570
It's going over the net!

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:03.650
Push it, Kageyama!

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.880
It's like...

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.870
...he's not his usual self.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.480
Nice receive!

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.940
I'm not going to lose! 
I'm not going to lose!

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.650
I'm going to win and remain on the court!

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.440
It's coming back!

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.440
Asahi-san, nice follow through!

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.200
Chance ball!

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.220
Oikawa has sense, and doesn't lack effort,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.080
but when you compare him 
to the mass of talent

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.920
named Kageyama that's two 
years younger than him,

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.880
Oikawa is an efficient player,
 but not a genius.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.420
I can say with confidence that,
at this moment in time,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.040
the one who is a better setter...

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.380
is Oikawa.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.140
Aoba Johsai                         Karasuno

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.660
Next Episode Preview

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.710
A player change now?

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.980
Yeah... that's always really rough...

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.670
You can't even raise your head 
when you leave the court.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.910
But Shimada, you were always 
a reserve, weren't you?

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:09.840
Uh...

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.930
