VS Nekoma

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.610
All right.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.430
I'm off.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.320
Have a nice time.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.200
Four more days 'til the 
practice match against Nekoma.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.160
In our matches from here on out...

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.770
That spike...

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.870
That receive...

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.090
They're going to be on our side!

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.050
It's kind of amazing.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.290
All right. It's training camp time!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.440
First-Year Class 1

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.100
Hinata, you're too restless.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.290
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.370
Episode 11:  Decision

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.530
All here?

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.570
Yeah.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.680
The practice match against 
Nekoma is in four days.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.040
Inter-High preliminaries 
will be soon thereafter.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.630
We've got no time,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.880
but you guys are full of holes.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590
Since that's the case,
 there's only one way for you to win.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.800
Practice.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.010
Practice.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.590
And practice.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.220
Save the ball, even if you have to barf.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.610
Yeah.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.430
He barfed already.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.890
Front, front.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.060
Hey, how many does it take 
for you to get it right?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.300
Concentrate!

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.820
One more.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.070
Here goes.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.690
Nice receive.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.690
Nice, Yamaguchi.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.910
That's five successful receives. Next up.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.810
Next!

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.120
I'm ready.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.310
Good job.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.130
All right. Spiking practice next.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.210
Yeah.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.730
All right.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.130
Nice kill.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.840
Nice kill.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.420
Looking good.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.850
May I go next?

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.070
Sure, sorry.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.530
Okay, let's get going.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.130
Yeah.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.620
Wow! This is where we're staying?

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.500
You need to calm down.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.010
But this is my first time at training camp.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.060
I have to hang all day 
with this slovenly bunch.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.330
What's so fun about that?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.770
Tsukishima, you bastard...

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.840
Kiyoko-san's within a 500 meter radius of us!

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.350
How can that be slovenly?

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.770
How pitiful that you can't understand 
how refreshing this space is!

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.350
It's like this wellspring 
in the Ou Mountains.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.070
Shimizu's home is nearby, 
so she's not staying here.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.380
What are you guys doing?

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.790
Take-chan...

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.660
We can't... go on...

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.850
Thank you for the food.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.520
Seconds, anyone?

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.170
Yes, please.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.480
S-Sure.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.970
It's first-years' turn to bathe.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.010
What's up, Hinata?

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.650
There...

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.040
There's a stranger among us.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.500
There shouldn't be.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.450
We're the only ones staying here.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.410
It's...

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.300
...a child.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.390
It can't be.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.980
You must've seen your reflection 
in the window or something.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.190
Maybe.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.190
I must've made a mistake.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.940
Of course...

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.610
It was a mistake.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.280
It was a mistake.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.810
What are you screaming about?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.710
Daichi-san will get mad.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.390
It was just Noya.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.930
Noya-san? B-But...

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.430
Noya-san grew shorter!

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.280
That's true. Your hair adds to your height!

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.100
Ryu, you bastard!

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.500
It's not funny!

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.640
Don't make so much noise...

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.210
Daichi will get mad...

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.340
It's me. It's Asahi.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.040
You guys shut up!

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.690
You're stalling. Don't swing your arms.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.370
Yeah. One more.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.810
Nice, Hinata.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.300
That's five successful receives.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.390
All right. That's the whole rotation.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.370
Next, running.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.510
Yeah.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.010
Hurry up, moron.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.440
They sure have a lot of energy,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.890
Shut up.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.140
even though they have to train 
during summer vacation.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.140
I saw Kageyama jogging at dawn.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.960
Oh, Hinata-kun was, too.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.750
He said it's because there's no 
mountain crossing at the lodge.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.570
Mountain crossing?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.450
That's why he's got all that stamina.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.570
Are you...

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.620
...worried about picking members
 for the match?

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.990
I'm undecided...

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.830
...about the setter.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.860
In terms of ability, Kageyama is my pick.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.800
Sugawara's is experienced and has played
 with an ace since his first year.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.850
However, Kageyama is talented enough
 to surpass all that experience in no time.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:40.560
Sugawara has been playing all this time.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.190
His teammates depend on him.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.400
Perhaps the reason why you 
can't decide, Ukai-kun,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.360
is because Sugawara-kun is in 
his third year. Is that so?

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.610
The third year is his last year. 
That's why you're thinking...

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.710
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm overstepping my bounds.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.210
No, I think you're exactly right.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.750
When...

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.430
...I was in my third year of high school,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.110
I was a starting member only once,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.430
when our younger official setter couldn't play.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.860
I remember the anguish I felt, 
that I wasn't picked to play.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.000
But as long as I'm the temporary coach now,

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.360
I can't base my decision 
on a player's feelings.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.990
Hinata.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.410
Don't yell unnecessarily.
It'll sap your strength.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.330
Hey, where are you going?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.800
Nobody's coming.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.280
Did I get lost?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.370
A bright red jersey.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.940
You don't see those around here.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.150
What are you doing?

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.990
Um...

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.110
I'm lost.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.640
You're from out of town?

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:15.970
Yeah.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.300
Is that thing fun?

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.050
Not really.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.370
I'm just passing time.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.610
Oh...

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.850
Are you a volleyball player?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.500
Huh?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.840
Those are volleyball shoes.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.380
Oh. Yeah.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.390
I'm in a volleyball club, too. 
I'm Hinata Shoyo.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.090
Kozume...

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.600
Kozume? That's your name?

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.880
Kozume...

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.310
...Kenma.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.990
So you're Kenma. Are you in high school?

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.670
Yeah.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.550
What year? I'm a first-year.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.730
I'm a second-year.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.280
Crap. You're older than me.
 Pardon me.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.490
Don't worry.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:03.400
I don't really like that kind
 of status stuff in athletics.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.570
Oh, is that so?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.530
Um... do you like volleyball?

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.250
Not particularly. I kind of just do it.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.220
I don't dislike it, 
but I don't like getting tired.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.140
But my friends play, and they 
probably can't do without me.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.940
I think it'll be more fun 
if you get to like it.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.090
I don't care.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.660
It's only while I'm in high school.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.980
What position do you play?

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.090
Setter.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.750
Really? You're a little 
different from our setter.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.900
Our setter is a little more... intense.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.910
I'm middle blocker.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.620
Wow...

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.530
Do you think it's kind of weird?

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.590
It's a position for tall guys.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.800
I guess... but I don't think that.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.120
I get told stuff a lot when I go to matches.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:11.870
They say: "The setter position is for 
the most talented player, so why him?"

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.570
Because I'm not very 
athletic to begin with.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.860
Oh... Is your team good?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.650
Well, I heard we were good a long time ago.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.330
But we fell into decline.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.040
Recently, though...

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.160
I think we're pretty good.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.090
What's your school?

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:40.880
Kenma.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.140
Oh. Kuro.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.490
Bye.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.220
See you soon, Shoyo.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.830
Don't go wandering off by yourself.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.550
Sorry.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.560
We're strangers to this place. 
You have to be careful.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.150
See you... soon?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.650
Hinata.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.610
Man, I was looking all over.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.160
I'm sorry.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.070
I was dashing, then got lost.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.160
Hinata, you go all out
 in every practice, don't you?

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.960
Yes.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.540
But I still need lots more training.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.210
I don't have enough strength yet.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.150
It makes me mad I'm treated 
as a set with Kageyama,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.580
and not as a full-fledged individual.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.720
Regardless, I want to play in the match.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.410
I want to stand on the court.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:36.400
Me, too.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.500
I want to stand on the court, too.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.240
So I'm going to fight 
my own battles, my way.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.860
Come on, or you'll be late for lunch.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.420
Yeah.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.700
Miyagi Prefecture
 Tsukinokizawa High School

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.160
Don't you think their setter
 is kind of small?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.380
Yeah, and he's kind of unsteady.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.990
Maybe he's a backup setter.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.090
I've never heard of this school.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.300
Nekoma

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.160
That unsteady shrimp
 you guys are talking about

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.470
is the backbone of Nekoma. He's our brain.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.990
And our heart.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.830
Ukai-san.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.040
What?

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.120
We third-years are done after this year.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.710
That's why our desire to win 
is double that of the others.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.260
We want the ticket that will 
take us to our next stage.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.480
If it's Kageyama who deserves 
that ticket more than me,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.730
you should give it to Kageyama 
without a second thought.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.370
Daichi, Asahi, and I have been playing 
together since our first year.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.610
I'd like to stand on
 the court with them,

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.570
and play as much as I am able.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.990
If Kageyama gets tired, 
or if something happens,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.040
I want to fill that void, 
or be a substitute.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.570
Even if it's out of pity 
because I'm a third-year,

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.500
as long as I get another chance
 to play in a match,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.500
that's all that matters.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.220
I don't care if I'm not the official setter.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.360
I won't give up my desire 
to play on the court.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.360
So I want as many chances as possible.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.530
I'm sorry for being so presumptuous.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:37.600
Sugawara.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.480
I think I've been underestimating you.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.520
To be honest, I'm amazed at you right now.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.230
What?

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.450
I'm not an experienced coach yet, but...

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.160
I will do everything in my power 
so you guys can go on winning.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.270
Thank you.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.040
Yeah.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.380
I'm going to get fired up. 
We'll win as many as we can.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.230
Yeah.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.350
Thank you for the food.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.130
Where does that appetite come from?

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.510
Hey, eat. Eat even if
 you can't eat any more!

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.580
It's midsummer. Just look at you guys.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.350
You're eating more than usual today, Suga.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.970
You'll shrivel up and croak if you don't eat!

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.970
You think so?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.810
I'll eat a lot, and give it my all.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.810
Yamaguchi, you're not eating that?

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.770
Hey! Let Yamaguchi eat his own food!

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.960
For the Nekoma battle, this 
will be our starting order.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.960
WS Sawamura        MB Hinata         WS Tanaka
WS Azumane   Li Nishinoya-MB Tsukishima   S Kageyama

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.570
It's a configuration you're barely used to,

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.010
so I'm not expecting you 
to synchronize right away.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.810
We now have an amazing libero, 
and the ace has returned,

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.680
but don't rely on those facts 
or think victory is assured.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.680
Victory goes to the team that connects.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.800
Let's see how this configuration works

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.020
in the battle against Karasuno's 
long-standing rival, Nekoma.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.820
Equipment room

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.700
Yeah.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.060
Asahi-san.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.920
I needn't mention Suga-san of course, 
but you're probably

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.660
feeling sorry for Ennoshita-san 
and the others, too, aren't you?

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.170
What?

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.540
The strong stand on the court. 
That's how it is.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.050
Um, Asahi-san.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.760
I can't say I've always 
been a devoted player.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.470
There was a time I quit, even. So...

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.730
If they become stronger than 
the ace in mind and body,

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.280
they will rightfully steal the regular 
position out from under you, Asahi-san.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.090
Right, Chikara?

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.480
Huh? I wouldn't go that far...

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.190
Or if a regular position were to be stolen,
 maybe it would be Ryu's first.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.200
You've got some nerve!

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.330
Throw the first punch, Ennoshita!

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.130
Nishinoya, that's enough!
 You've made your point!

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.990
There.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.960
Um, Ennoshita-san...

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:07.980
Hm?

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.560
What you said before practice...

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.870
Oh, about quitting once?

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.930
You've heard that Director Ukai 
came back for a while last year, right?

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.140
Yes.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:23.060
It's pathetic, but there were a few of us

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.850
who couldn't keep up with his training.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.240
The club was just for fun 'til he came back.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.270
Then it suddenly became a club 
for the purpose of winning.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.820
Those of us who were just casual players 
 got scared and quit.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.340
But we still wanted to play volleyball, 
so we decided to come back.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.350
By then Director Ukai was already gone.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.540
We're pathetic second-years,

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.690
but we came back.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.250
So we want to do our best, 
and not get left in the dust by you guys.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.920
So we'll say it one more time.
 We look forward to playing with you.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.700
Yes.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.350
Sensei.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:06.420
All set?

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:06.940
Yes.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.150
Washed, folded, and all set.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.610
Uchisawa
Cleaning

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.610
It's the uniforms.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.820
Wow...

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.820
Karasuno

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.760
It's the one I saw on TV.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:17.780
Huh?

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.110
Here.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.350
But only Noya-san's is orange. You stand out.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.480
Thank you very much.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.370
Of course. After all, I have the leading role.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.770
Leading role?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.440
The libero goes on and off the court
 frequently during a match.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.380
He's the only one that 
needs to be noticeable. Idiot.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.980
I know that. I totally know that.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.430
Kageyama is one notch higher than me...

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.850
I knew he was going to say that.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.450
Just be grateful we first-years 
get to wear a uniform at all.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.940
I know that.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.700
Yeah, I guess you don't 
remember that number,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.770
because you saw it only once on TV, right?

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:57.610
Huh?

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:02.550
The Little Giant wore #10 
when he went to nationals.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.370
Was this your thoughtful idea, Coach?

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.380
Nope, just a coincidence.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.050
Then, it's destiny.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.090
It's a coincidence.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.070
Don't be jealous, Kageyama-kun.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:17.800
Why would I be jealous?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.010
By the way,

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:25.470
The Little Giant that Hianata admires
played on the best team Karasuno's ever had.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.000
But even then, Karasuno never 
defeated Nekoma. Not even once.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.150
It was one loss after another.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.110
I want you to turn the tables on them.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.440
Yeah.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.390
Okay, let's start practice.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.310
Yeah.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:41.660
Nekoma must be very good.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.920
What's their team like?

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.210
I don't know about now, but in the past,

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.870
the team has had very solid receivers.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.270
It's not that they had outstanding players.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.750
They just had no holes.
They were the opposite of our team.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.010
They lived up to their "Neko" name...

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.970
They were flexible.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.140
What the heck?

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.890
We spike and spike, yet the ball 
never drops on their court!

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.230
Nekoma       Shirato

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.190
All right.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.900
It's not like there's a genius player 
among them, in offense or defense...

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.000
Why are they so good?

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.410
About our destined opponent, Karasuno...

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.160
Do they have a female manager or not?

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.790
I bet a yakisoba bread that they don't.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:38.790
What? I'd prefer that they did, 
so my bet is that they do.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:39.710
Me, too.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:44.780
Jackasses. We don't, so won't 
it make you mad if they do?

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.180
Uh...

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.140
What if they had a beauty for a manager?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.690
I won't ever forgive them!

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.400
I never will.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.720
And if that's the case, 
you'd better watch out, Karasuno!

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.110
Shut up, Yamamoto!

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.440
Hey, Kenma. What do you think?

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.150
I don't care either way.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.120
I knew you'd say that.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.170
But...

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.830
Huh?

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.330
I'm kind of looking forward to it.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.660
Our match against Karasuno.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.200
Kenma, who has no will to play, 
is looking forward to a match?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.870
Yamamoto, you seem full of energy.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.420
You can practice double 
the amount if you'd like.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.590
S-Sorry.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.810
Hey, Hinata.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.280
They said it's our turn to bathe.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.600
Hey. Don't get all worked up again and barf.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200
I won't barf.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.660
I know it goes without saying, 
but even if they can't play in the match,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.740
I know they still want to play.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.520
I'm only allowed to play 
because of your toss.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.140
It's frustrating, but I wouldn't 
be allowed on my own merit.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.180
I'm taking a bath and 
going to sleep right away.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.500
Damn you, bastard... 
That was a false start!

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:17.040
Why must they compete to see 
who can bathe the fastest?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.150
They're morons.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.020
I get tired just watching them.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.210
Hey! Who's running?

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.080
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Club

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.720
Next Episode Preview

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.600
The match against Nekoma 
is around the corner.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.060
I must say, that pudding-head,
