00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.660
What are you thinking?!

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.130
You won't get your way!

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.470
Hinata, you're running too far away!

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.900
Shoyo, I don't think that's 
a scheming face...

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.210
I think he's actually 
smiling, maybe...

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.220
Don't say "maybe," Nishinoya!

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.760
Hinata, I'll kill you!

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.540
Kageyama's actually trying to smile...

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.730
Use the signs I told you about. 
We're changing our plan.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.170
Thanks!

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.690
Did Sugawara-san tell you about the signs?

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.070
I heard it in between sets.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.030
All right!

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.780
Let's keep it going!

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.360
Heck yeah!

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.960
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.960
Episode 22: Evolution

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.640
Don't look so amazed. I was pretty nervous.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.850
Really?

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.530
Of course, there were third-years that 
played at last year's Inter-High,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.380
so I wasn't able to play in 
a lot of official matches.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.180
I hate to say it,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.890
but it's likely that Kageyama's had his 
feet on the court more than I have.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.230
Despite that, Kageyama was 
freaking out quite a bit.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.280
Speaking of, the King's 
going right into a serve.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.750
Do you think he'll be all right?

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.490
Kageyama, nice serve!

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.060
Nice serve! One point!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.270
Kageyama looks pretty happy.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.200
Yeah.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.760
It sort of puts me at ease.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.920
What does?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.890
Apparently every player feels 
the same pride about the fact

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.130
that they're going to be on the court.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.300
No matter whether they're some 
genius or just a regular guy.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.810
Kageyama-kun, relax!

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.740
Oh. Apparently, he's fine.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.110
We're ending this the first time!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.570
Yeah!

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.830
Watari!

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.040
Service ace!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.250
He even got it from the libero!

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.210
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.210
And now they're tied.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.710
Yes!

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.250
I'm sorry!

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.300
It's all right! We'll get the next one!

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.260
Yeah!

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.760
Yeah!

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.930
He's asking for a high five, you idiot!

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.480
Yeah!

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.480
Yeah...

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.210
Kageyama just gave someone a high five.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.440
Yeah...

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.390
Sorry! Cover!

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.090
Right!

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.510
They broke it! It's coming back!

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.640
Chance ball!

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.710
"Bring it"...

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.670
...or "to me"?

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.800
Which will it be?

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.290
They didn't say anything?!

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.910
There it is!

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.260
That quick is so insane!

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.550
All right! Now Karasuno's 
turning things around!

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.930
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.390
Sugawara-san compliments me
 a lot if I make it!

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.680
Hey, Hinata.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:56.630
Well done...

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.650
Are you my boss?

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.530
Hinata's so sharp! Damn!

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.680
And Kageyama's playing like a fish in water.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.460
Kageyama...

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.320
..."Tobiuo".

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.320
(Tobiuo = flying fish)

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.460
Damn it.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.790
All right, calm down.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.500
There's no need for us to panic
 and break down for them.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.400
We just have to get one back, 
and we'll be fine.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.000
Right!

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.130
Hey, that facial expression 
and pose piss me off, so stop.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.220
So rude!

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.890
Iwaizumi-san, nice receive!

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.370
Kageyama has apparently 
regained his usual rhythm.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.230
I'm sorry...

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.230
Don't mind!

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.770
No, that's not all...

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.190
He was only concerned about 
the opponent's block.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.630
I should have made it go 
towards the side a little.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.040
Don't worry. They were all good serves.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.990
Now, just slightly, his concern is 
for his teammates as well.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.990
Thank you.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.670
All right... Don't hold back.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.880
If we don't get this set, it's hopeless.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.610
Make sure you use that freak 
quick as much as possible!

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.970
Kunimi, nice serve!

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.590
All right!

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.660
Nice receive!

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.760
Kageyama told Hinata that if he's around, 
Hinata would be the best...

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.630
But even with you...

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.940
You, with Hinata's attacks...

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.610
You're the best.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.570
All right! They broke 20 points first!

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.280
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.280
Now it's the final scene...

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.630
That hurt, you idiot!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.920
All right, we're in the 20's.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.920
I'm driving some spirit into you!

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.880
I guess our issue might be over there.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.720
Why did it turn into 
Tsukishima versus Kageyama?!

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.910
One more!

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.680
Hinata, nice serve!

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.140
Net in!

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.140
Chance ball!

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.900
Mattsun, nice cover!

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.600
Kageyama!

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.800
All right!

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.080
How would you like the toss?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.570
A bit higher would be great.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.280
Got it!

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.240
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.230
All right!

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.200
I guess even Seijoh would 
call a time-out after that.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.780
When #10 falls back and when #11 moves up,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.210
the number of times Karasuno uses 
the center decreases, doesn't it?

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.630
Yeah. Simply put, I think that Tobio 
doesn't get along with the giant.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.660
In yesterday's match,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.670
as well as today's, they don't seem 
to be communicating very well.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.360
I think that out of all 
of Karasuno's spikers,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.010
Tobio has the hardest time 
accommodating that giant.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.400
I really don't want to be friends with you.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.480
Why?!

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.510
You seem like you'd use 
our weaknesses against us.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.110
Why would I use my teammates'
 weaknesses against them?!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.040
I think that Sugawara-san makes 
sure to pay attention to all of

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.040
Tsukishima, I think you're 
jumping too soon for the block.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.450
Hold back a little.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.860
the spikers' expressions as well 
as how they're doing that day.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.480
Understood.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.800
Yamaguchi, make sure you 
clearly call everything.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.540
Right.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.150
What?

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.060
He may have asked me to read his expression,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.520
but I don't see anything other 
than a face pisses me off.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.710
Kageyama.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.460
First, you need to have 
a conversation. Talk.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.390
Especially with Tsukishima, 
communication is key.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.140
Right...

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:25.900
Got it!

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.240
He picked it up! Here comes the counter!

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.580
Nice receive!

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.330
Left!

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.700
Tsukishima's not hitting 
it with all he's got.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.790
They caught up!

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.370
Damn, they're tied now.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.210
A break!

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.330
Yeah, totally.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.750
Sensei.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.650
Right.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.370
All right!

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.760
Maybe they lack attack power, after all.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.470
Karasuno not having #10 here would be rough.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.930
Come on, your faces! They're all tense!

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.350
Calm down and go! Your moves are great!

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.530
Yeah.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.710
Hey.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.980
How was that toss, damn it?

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.080
Why are you talking like Tanaka-san?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.410
What was that, damn it?

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.660
It's like you're saying, "Shut up, and hit 
this toss, you commoner," and it pisses me off.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.700
What?!

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.660
Dang it, Tsukishima...

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.170
You sound like a kid. Stop picking fights!

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.800
What do you mean by that?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.890
I have my own way of doing things,

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.760
so I'd rather you keep 
your tosses consistent.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.660
Um, what does that mean?

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.490
I'm assuming that when Kageyama 
sets an A-quick to Tsukishima,

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.940
the course it should go in is 
being determined by the toss.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.640
Cross

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.190
If the ball is about a ball's width 
away and center, it's a cross,

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.290
and if it's further, it's a turn.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.640
Turn

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.080
Kageyama is, of course, setting it 
where he thinks it'll succeed the best,

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.370
but I think Tsukshima is having 
a hard time hitting those.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.330
You're not the only one thinking.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.620
"The shape of the opponent's defense."

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.210
"The best attacks I've been doing today."

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.800
We're all thinking about that.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.750
Even Hinata has started thinking enough
 to use normal quicks now, right?

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.450
Though just barely.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.510
What'd you mean by that?! 
What do you mean, "just barely"?!

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.390
Now, now....

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.870
All right.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.330
You're rather agreeable today.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.850
You feeling okay?

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.250
We're just going to have to try and find out.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.580
Tsukishima's probably not used 
to people who face him head on,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.050
We're taking this set, no matter what!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.050
and he can't run from that.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.740
Right!

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.620
Nice, Noya-san!

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.000
I have my own way of doing things,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.920
so I'd like you to keep 
your tosses consistent.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.180
A feint!

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.230
Yeah! He got over the block!

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.600
He totally did it!

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.790
How annoying!

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.650
I thought that he was going to hit 
it hard up until the end.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.110
Nice! Tsukishima's lively after 
getting through the opponent's guard.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.570
"Lively"?

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.540
It's hard to see, but that expression 
he has means he's pretty into it.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.530
Oh.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.540
Chance ball!

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.420
Another feint!

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.280
Nice, Watari.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.130
It's coming back!

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.190
Chance ball!

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.400
#11's pretty good.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.380
But Seijoh's block is pretty high, so
I think they're avoiding a straight-on attack.

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.090
With a feint, you can sort of run away.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.410
Looks like #11 is running away 
from the blocks after all.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.310
All right!

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.350
Nice, Mattsun.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.650
Damn it. They're taking back 
one point after another.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.110
Karasuno                           Aoba Johsai

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.110
Center, #11!

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.960
Again? All right! This time I'll get it!

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.680
Nice receive, Watari!

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.630
All right!

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.830
Center!

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.750
Tanaka, nice receive!

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.210
Damn it!

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.140
Be careful!

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.120
Sorry, it's a bit short! Cover!

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.170
They really need to get this.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.880
Will it go to the ace after all?

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.010
We're all thinking about that.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.770
#11 again!

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.020
No! Don't go out too far!

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.650
All right!

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.860
You piss me off, you know that?

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.680
They're being too cautious about the feints,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.410
so our defense is being 
concentrated up front.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.410
I'm sorry!

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.660
They got us.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.660
It's all right. Next time!

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.840
Kn-Knife... Nuff... Nice.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.670
Don't mess up that line, Kageyama!

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.200
Wow. Kageyama complimented Tsukishima.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.740
Kageyama is definitely changing, as well.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.450
How much do you suck at compliments?!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.310
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.410
Karasuno's at set point.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.310
Seriously?!

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:17.760
Just one more point!

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.770
Just one more point!

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.030
We won't let you have it!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.000
Go, go, go, Hajime!

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.740
Karasuno                            Aoba Johsai

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.740
Push it, push it, Hajime! One more!

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.740
It'll be fine!

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.900
One point!

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.210
If we can get this one point, 
like we usually do, this set will be ours!

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.790
Congratulations.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.700
Best Setter Award 
 Oikawa Toru

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.750
The third year of junior high,

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.640
our last tournament...

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.450
That's a rare smile, with no ulterior motive.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.490
My smile is always straightforward and pure.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.420
"Straightforward and pure" coming 
from you is already impure.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.880
Of course I'm happy!
 It's the first time I've received this.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Oikawa Toru, overall, 
is a pretty silly guy,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.890
but there was a time that 
he wasn't smiling.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.390
He had a more athletic build than others.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.100
He was also blessed with natural ability.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.820
Especially when he began junior high,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.150
the way he matured was 
way ahead of the flock.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.990
Miyagi Prefecture Junior High 
Newcomer Volleyball Tournament

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.530
Even then, there were walls 
that he could not climb.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.110
Thanks to the Young Giant Ushiwaka, 
Shiratorizawa Academy Junior High

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.450
was eventually known as 
the best in the prefecture.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.210
Why can't we win?!

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.970
When we fought them, we lost.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.210
We couldn't even get one set.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.860
We tried to go higher, to a higher stage,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.220
but we were thwarted until our 
third year in junior high.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:15.770
Then...

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.520
My name is Kageyama Tobio and I came 
from Akiyama Elementary School.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.020
I've been playing volleyball 
since the second grade.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.800
It's a pleasure to be working with you!

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.040
A genius appeared at his back,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.070
and his talent shone 
with astonishing brightness.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.580
More than anything, it appeared that 
he was very happy to be touching the ball.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.250
Plus, the way he was able to handle the ball 
was on a totally different level than others.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.700
We'll have him play the basic positions,
 but he'll be a setter some day.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.750
Indeed.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.640
After that, Oikawa ended up
 practicing even harder.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.220
You're overworking yourself!

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.530
The coach just warned you 
about that yesterday!

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.860
If you get hurt, everything 
will be pointless, you dumbass!

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.550
Come on, you're done. Stretch!

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.650
He seemed to be panicking.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.870
That panic surfaced in a practice 
match in the form of an

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.730
unbelieveable amount of combo misses.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.620
And then...

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.380
Kageyama, give it a shot.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.080
Yes, sir.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.860
Okay!

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.070
Front! Front!

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.990
Got it.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.700
Nice cover!

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.300
Nice key!

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.690
Nice serve!

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:46.770
Oikawa-san.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.400
Please show me how to serve.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.490
Get away.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:00.950
Get away.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.410
Get away.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.440
Don't come over here!

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.300
Calm down, you dumbass!

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.460
Sorry...

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.010
Kageyama, I'm sorry, 
but we're done for today.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.300
Oh, okay...

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.240
The change-up today was to cool your head.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.980
You need to have some more composure!

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.400
Right now, I can't win against Shiratorizawa,

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.200
so there's no way I can have composure!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.550
I want to win and go to nationals.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.520
To win, I need to...

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.060
"I" this, "I" that. It's annoying!

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.050
Do you think you're fighting by yourself?!

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.330
You've got to be kidding, you dumbass!

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.940
If you think how you're doing equals 
how the team will do, I'll punch you!

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.220
You already did!

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.240
There's no one on our team who 
can beat Ushiwaka one-on-one!

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.940
However...

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.860
There are <i>six</i> players on a volleyball court!

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.560
Even if our opponent's some 
genius first-year, or Ushiwaka,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.570
the team with the better six
 is stronger, you dumbass!

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.020
"The team with the better six is stronger."

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.210
Sorry, did I headbutt you too hard?

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.510
Well, how do I put this?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.220
I suddenly feel invincible.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.040
More importanty, Iwa-chan,
 is "dumbass" the only insult you've got?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.490
Want me to make your nose bleed 
from the right side, too?

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.230
Nice course!

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:49.900
One more!

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.880
I don't know how to put it, but it 
looks like Oikawa's gotten over it.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.860
Yes.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.280
Oikawa-san, please show me 
the basics of a serve toss.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.500
Heck no, you idiot! Idiot!

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.280
Oikawa! Stop picking fights 
with the first-years!

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.790
Our last tournament in junior high...

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:11.750
Kitagawa-Daiichi                     Shiratorizawa

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.000
We fought against Shiratorizawa Junior High,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.750
and were able to get our first set.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.210
We ended up in second place
 behind Shiratorizawa.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.920
Best Setter Award 
 Oikawa Toru

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.920
Oikawa was given the Best Setter Award.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:24.320
This award is proof that our 
spikers gave it all they had.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.930
Does that mean Ushiwaka's even higher?

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.400
Once we get into high school,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320
that's when...

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.670
we'll show Shiratorizawa who's boss!

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.780
Naturally.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.280
And Tobio-chan,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.650
I don't know where you'll 
be headed after this,

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.500
but I'm gonna crush you,
so you better be prepared.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.180
Blow your nose before saying your line!

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.710
Would you like a tissue?

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.710
Shut up!

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.800
Go, go, go! Go, go, Seijoh!

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.920
Karasuno                                      Aoba Johsai

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.610
Bring it!

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.940
Push it, push it, push it! Push it, Seijoh!

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.920
Nice serve!

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.920
Nice serve!

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.640
Now we have Oikawa-kun serving...

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.520
The second opponent you want to show 
who's boss is right in front of you...

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.730
You can give it all you've got.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.450
I know.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.030
Go!

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.950
Nishinoya!

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.270
It went up!

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.750
Yeah! But it's going to go 
right back to Seijoh's side.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.210
If they miss a serve here, they'd be losing 
this set, and yet he served like that...

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.170
He's amazing!

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.200
Chance ball!

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.920
The receive went perfectly 
back to the setter.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.470
The highest probability is that they'll 
use a quick attack from the center.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.520
It probably is. I know that's what I'd do...

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.640
But in this stage where they're being 
pushed into a corner, Oikawa-san...

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.650
will set it to Iwaizumi-san!

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.620
All right!

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.580
Karasuno                                      Aoba Johsai

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.320
Seriously?

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.580
Karasuno got the set back.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.940
Damn it! I'm sorry!

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:19.840
Don't mind!

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.430
Why are you laughing? I'll punch you!

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.510
Stop saying you'll hit me 
all the time, Iwa-chan.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:29.560
Don't worry. I'd only say that 
to you, and I won't hit you.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.270
Right then, doing a quick attack from the 
center would have been the cliché move.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.650
What?

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.590
But apparently Tobio was able to read
 that I'd send to the left.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.740
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.740
Do you understand what this means?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.570
It means it's come down to
 not only methodical thinking,

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.140
but, in the end, our effort, as well.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.510
My perfect trust with you, Iwa-chan.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.410
Like I'd ever want that with you.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.270
That just means they were making 
rather comprehensive decisions.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.590
What did Mr. Refreshing

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.410
tell Tobio?

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.060
The dictator king is somehow 
trying to become a decent king.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.350
What is this?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.230
I'm really pissed off, and yet...

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.610
Hurry! Let's hurry up and finish

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.940
the final set!

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.210

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.170
We've gotten to the final set.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.750
Man, I got way too worked up, 
even though it's out of character.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.250
That's rare.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.000
Though my selling point is the 
fact that I'm a cute beauty.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.460
Make volleyball your selling point!

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.680
