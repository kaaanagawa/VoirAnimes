00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.530
Move faster!

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.750
Jump higher!

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.090
More! More! More!

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.690
Why?

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.810
Why don't they jump?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060
We're fed up with you.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.230
You egocentric king.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.070
Good morning.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.400
The beautiful girl. 
The beautiful girl is here.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.580
Hey, hey. Is she a manager?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.290
All right. Let's get started.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.380
I'll be on Tsukishima's team.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.170
What? You, Captain?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.260
Don't worry.
 Tanaka's a better attacker than me.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.930
Though I won't go easy on you, either.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.390
Um... that little one and Tanaka-san, 
which one shall I crush—

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.810
I mean— block first?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.060
Oh, yes, yes. 
I'd like to see the king lose, too.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.870
Tsukki, they can hear you. 
Watch it.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.250
I'm saying it so they can hear it.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.570
I sure hope they lose their cool.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.750
Tsukishima, you got character problems.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.580
Our special feature is the king, 
who's been abandoned by his underlings.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.250
Hey, hey.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.970
Did you hear that?

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.200
My, the things he says.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.760
Oh, that Tsukishima-kun, 
I'm going to really...

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.200
crush him to a pulp.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.090
Haikyu!!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.530
Episode 4: The View From the Summit

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.630
He blew that big first-year 
out of the water.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.370
Awesome power! More than usual!

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.570
Tanaka, shut up!

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.340
Showboating!

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.290
Don't take your shirt off!

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.350
Maybe you shouldn't have razzed Tanaka.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.670
Okay!

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.630
Me, too... Me, too...

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.090
Hinata.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.090
I get a toss, too...

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.550
This is my first high school match
and my first spike.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.430
I'll score.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.570
And yet again, even here...

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.660
there's a high, high wall.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.220
You surprised me the other day, too.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.090
You sure can jump.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.820
If only you were 30 centimeters taller, 
you could've become a superstar.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.950
So he's tall! He's only one opponent.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.000
One more.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.880
I'll score the next one.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.630
Blocked again.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.100
Kageyama-Hinata        Tsukishima-Yamaguchi

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.530
How many is that now?

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.090
Tsukki, nice!

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.750
Tanaka is scoring consistently, though.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.100
Nice block, Tsukishima.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.390
Damn...

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.670
Thank you.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.290
This guy's better than I thought.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.110
Hey, there. 
He's constantly getting blocked.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.020
You should do the king's toss.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.820
The toss that decimates his enemies...

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.710
and decimates his teammates, as well.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.570
Shut up.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.490
Yamaguchi, nice serve.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.750
Sorry, Tsukki.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.650
Don't mind. Don't mind.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.210
We don't need a speedy attack.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.510
We can win without it.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.180
Go, killer serve.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.140
Kageyama's jump-serve.
 It was powerful...

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.640
I'll rack the points up all at once.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.560
Go.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.810
Huh?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.810
Yamaguchi.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.150
I got it, Tsukki.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.000
Damn it.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.420
Nice toss, Tsukki.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.400
Daichi-san's weapon is his solid receive.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.150
They've got serious defense.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.490
Did you think you'd score a few points?

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.690
I don't have outstanding talent,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.050
but I've been doing this
 a couple years longer than you.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.990
My receive is well-integrated into my body.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.320
Don't think you can get past me that easily.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.260
Awesome...

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.880
Hey, king.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.440
Maybe you should start getting serious.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.180
What's your problem?

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.120
You haven't stopped getting 
in our faces since the other day.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.980
What's this "king's toss"?

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.850
Don't you know why they call him "king"?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.770
He's called that because he's so good

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.370
that guys at other schools are
 intimidated by him, isn't that it?

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.570
I'm sure there are others 
who think that's why.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.960
However, his nickname of "king of the court"

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.100
was given to him by the guys 
of Kitagawa Daiichi.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.580
By the teammates of the king.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.830
What it means is...

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.340
He's the self-centered king.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.170
The oppressive dictator.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.240
I heard rumors, but I was convinced 
when I saw that match.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.750
He got too oppressive,  
and had to sit out on the bench.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.640
Kita-ichi. Kita-ichi.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.060
Kosen Gakuen / Kitagawa Daiichi

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.190
All right.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.860
Damn... they block high.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.170
We have to get past them somehow.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.070
We need a much faster attack...

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.230
So fast it's unblockable.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.540
Don't mind. Don't mind.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.280
Sorry.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.410
Faster!

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.280
Nice serve!

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.900
Right!

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.420
Are you kidding?
 Your tosses are reckless.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.740
What's the point if we can't spike them?

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.380
But we can't win if we don't
 get past their blocks.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.550
Does it end here?

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.010
Is this where I lose?

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.290
No! I'm going to nationals.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.980
Move faster! 
Jump higher!

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.340
Match my tosses, if you want to win!

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.180
And then, the first set.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.220
At the opponent's set point.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.080
Where I tossed...

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.960
there was no one there.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.430
We had a few mistakes that day,

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.380
but that last one was no mistake.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.310
It was rejection.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.030
It was the point where they said,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.100
"We're not following you any more."

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.370
Kageyama.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.350
Go sit on the bench.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.360
He doesn't set up quick hits.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.490
Is that because he's lost 
his nerve from that match?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.720
Dude. You've been yammering too much.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.660
Tanaka.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.960
He made a toss, but no one jumped—

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.080
You are right.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.790
I made a toss, and no one was there.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.390
It's truly frightening.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.890
But you were only in junior high, right?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.580
You toss to me just fine.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.020
It makes no difference to me.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.190
The real problem for me is how 
I'm going to get past you.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.670
We'll win against Tsukishima, 
become official club members,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.670
and you will bravely play setter.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.780
And you'll toss to me.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.520
What else is there?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.210
How pure and straightforward... 
and irritating.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.400
You can't make up for height 
by psyching yourself up.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.430
If you believe effort alone will win out...

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.320
You're dead wrong.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.510
I got it.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.360
Tanaka-san.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:43.600
Toss it to me!

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.460
Who do I toss to?

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.130
Hinata can't beat Tsukishima one-on-one...

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.710
Tanaka-san.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:50.510
Kageyama!

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.860
There was...

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.570
no one there...

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.190
I'm here.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.820
That was close.
 I almost missed it.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:11.720
It's out, though.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.390
What was that for?

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.890
But the ball came to me.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.300
Forget about junior high.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.430
I'll take any toss I can get. Gratefully.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.350
I'll jump anywhere.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.390
I'll hit any ball.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.890
So...

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.060
Toss it to me!

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.910
I was sure Kageyama was 
going to toss to Tanaka,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.630
but he instinctively responded 
to Hinata's voice and motion instead.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.720
And made a perfectly accurate toss.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.430
For now, only his bad attitude stands out,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.140
but Kageyama is awesome, after all.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.100
Hey guys, you know how to do quick hits?

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.480
Quick hits?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.770
A fast attack like the one you just did.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.380
Not at all.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.550
All I've ever spiked are balls 
that get tossed high up.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.190
But you just did it.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.460
And when you were in junior high, 
I saw you spike

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.330
a missed toss by the beginner setter.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.220
That's what I mean.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.020
Huh? But I don't remember how I did it.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.060
But I'll spike any toss.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:32.830
I'll spike it, understood?

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.670
We've never gotten coordinated.
A fast attack is impossible.

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.710
Did he just say "impossible"?

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.930
Does this guy know the meaning 
of the word "impossible"?

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.190
There's something weird about you.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.470
Your weakness is giving me the creeps. Weird!

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.880
Shut up.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.840
It's not like you, king.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.180
I'll spike it past you. Wait and see!

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.870
There you go again, all psyched up.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.110
Just getting psyched up
 isn't going to make things right.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.280
Some people aren't cut out for some things.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:08.740
Clearly, you're not 
cut out to be a spiker.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.750
That's true.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.470
Even when I was in junior high,

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:18.140
I would jump and jump,
 but I kept getting blocked.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.760
Height is needed for volleyball.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.850
No matter how high I jump,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.970
I can't get past their overwhelming height.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.680
But...

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.440
I know I want to become like that.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.690
So I don't care if I'm cut out for it or not.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.270
I'm going to do battle with this body,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.440
win and win,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.490
and be on the court as long as I can.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.920
No...

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.880
I want to be...

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.430
On the court as long as I can.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.610
But you don't have what it takes.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.350
This isn't a matter of psychology.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.070
You can't make up for height with feelings.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.560
If you could play libero,
 that would be a different matter.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.910
Toss to me! Bring it on!

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.400
To break the wall in front of the spiker...

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.370
That's the setter's job.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.100
Wh-What, Kageyama?

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.220
Ouch, let go. Let me go!

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.420
Calm down, Kageyama!

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.120
What's the big idea—

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.260
Listen.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.600
If you can't spike it, avoid it.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.040
Use every ounce
 of physical ability you have.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.020
Use your reflexes and spike my tosses.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.530
Huh? That's how you
 explain a fast attack?

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:52.970
Understood.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.190
Liar! You don't understand it!

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.440
We'll do it anyway.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.170
What got into you all of a sudden?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.420
You were sniveling like an introverted brat.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.650
I'm not introverted.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.400
Liar!

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.610
All right...

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.410
Let's do this.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.070
With this guy's reflexes and speed, 
I know he can spike a fast toss.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.130
All right! Come on, toss.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.000
Come anywhere.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.210
Tsukki, nice serve.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.460
We don't have signals yet, 
but what the heck...

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.460
Okay. He's tossing that way.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.680
Hinata.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.510
<i>All right. That was a weaker 
serve than Captain Yoshida's.</i>

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.910
Then, I'll jump this way...

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.430
Huh?

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.600
It's that fast?

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.680
Hey! What are you doing?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.830
You have to be faster—

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.210
And there it is, the king's toss.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.560
It's hard to get it right the first time.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.110
I wonder.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.280
All right. Got it.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.490
What is this, net fishing?

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.960
I don't know how to time it at all.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.090
You've got fast reflexes, 
so go like "pah," like "gwah."

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.300
Is it "pah" or "gwah," which is it?

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.470
You just don't get it.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.390
Kageyama.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.260
You're repeating what you did in junior high.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.220
Um...

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.330
Hinata has the reflexes, speed,
 and the springing power.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.600
If he gets used to it, 
he can do fast attacks.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.770
But Hinata's weapon, which is his speed...

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.980
your toss is killing it, don't you think?

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.590
Hinata has no technique
 and no experience.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.820
Sugawara-san.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.100
He's not an outstanding player 
who can match your ability.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.110
But his potential is tops.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.050
Don't call me a genius or anything. 
That's an exaggeration.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.540
He never said that.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.040
If you can do it...

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:52.310
You need to synch with Hinata's style, 
or his talent, or...

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.150
Um...

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.510
Suga-san, fight!

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.100
You know, use them to your advantage.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.000
I'm a setter like you.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.310
I watched you in last year's match,
 and I was intimidated.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.230
By your extraordinary talent, 
your ball control,

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.940
and most of all...

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.110
By your ability to calmly detect 
your opponent's movements,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.580
and your power to make quick decisions.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.910
I don't have any of those things.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.650
That's not true, Suga-san...

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.790
Tanaka. Listen to what he has to say.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.760
You have technique.
 You have overwhelming drive to win,

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:32.090
and you have an extraordinary 
awareness of your surroundings.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.590
So there's no way you can't see 
what your teammate is doing.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.750
What's the best thing to do here?

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.890
What is it?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.150
But the ball still got tossed to me.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.160
I...

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.720
I envy your athletic reflexes.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.530
Huh?

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.760
But you waste your treasure, 
and that infuriates me.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.450
Huh?

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.260
So I'm going to use all of your abilities.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.670
What?

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.440
Use your highest speed.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.570
Use your highest jump.

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:16.200
I'll bring the ball to you.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.060
Bring the ball? What's that mean?

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.490
Get to where there's no blocker 
at your max speed, and jump.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.020
Then spike with all your strength.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.100
You don't have to watch my toss.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.110
You don't have to synch with the ball.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.040
What? But if I don't see
 the ball, I'll spike at air.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.070
Maybe so.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.070
Hey!

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.280
But I want to try this.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.400
All right.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.430
What's he going to try now?

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.520
No one can spike the king's egocentric toss.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.420
No kidding.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.500
What's he going to do?

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.010
There's no way Hinata 
can handle those tosses.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.970
Kageyama-Hinata     Tsukishima-Yamaguchi

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.970
Nice serve! One point!

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.100
Amazing concentration.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.990
Watch. Watch.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.730
Where are the blockers?

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.070
Where's the ball?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.690
Where's the spiker?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.840
How will they move?

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.440
Where will they jump?

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.160
How high can this guy jump?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.830
Now.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.120
This position. This timing, this angle.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:29.710
Good.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.800
My hand...

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.620
It hit my hand!

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.460
He's so over the top.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.830
Hey.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.560
Hinata's eyes were closed just then.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.740
What?

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.890
Um... what?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.960
From the moment he jumped
 up until he spiked,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.860
Hinata had his eyes closed.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.480
That means Kageyama tossed it
 directly into Hinata's palm

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.570
when he wasn't even looking.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.340
He synched the toss to the moment 
he'd swing, with total accuracy.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.150
Awesome. Awesome.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:10.610
Hey, what was that? What was that?

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.760
It hit my hand. Right then. Hey.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.440
Hey, you!

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.060
Why did you have your eyes closed?

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.880
You told me not to watch the ball.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.420
When my eyes are open, 
I can't help but watch the ball.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.970
I said that, but...

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.030
It worked though, right?

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.320
What's wrong with that?

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.940
Sure, but who trusts anyone 100 percent?

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.440
Well, I have no choice but 
to trust you right now.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.780
You're lousy as crap.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.950
What were you doing 
for the last three years?

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.400
This guy's spring, his mobility...

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.910
You're awesome, man!

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.910
What the heck was that, anyway? Hey!

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.190
I can enhance them with my toss!

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.820
All right. If Hinata's spike scores, 
the marks will even out,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.280
which makes it easier 
for Tanaka-san to spike, too.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.540
Yeah.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.540
All right.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.580
I don't have any faith in us whatsoever,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.430
but I'll keep bringing the ball to you.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.470
Just trust me, and jump.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:10.430
Right there.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.150
Sorry.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.670
I wonder if that last one was pure luck...

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.920
The precision of his tosses
 is definitely getting higher.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.150
You think so?

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.610
Yeah.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.040
Here, Hinata.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.820
Darn... that was too far from the net.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.820
Oh, thank you very much.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.460
This isn't so easy after all...

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.440
Watching the court at once is hard...

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:30.610
Are you okay?

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.110
Yes!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.710
But...

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.670
This is fun.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.710
What're you smiling about?

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.630
That's the second time it hit my face.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.100
I don't get it.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.850
That last one must've been sheer luck.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.090
Yet he keeps trying the same thing.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:51.600
But maybe Hinata will keep jumping 
without watching the ball.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.040
Did you do that on purpose?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.750
Truly, I don't get it either.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.560
Don't you know we have to win?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.830
No one can trust someone 100 percent.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.120
Of course I know that, dolt.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.690
Not to mention your own rival.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.490
Darn, this isn't working.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.030
But...

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.240
That sensation on my palm

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.120
and the heft of the ball 
you feel in your hand...

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.680
I love how that feels.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.800
Once more. Once more.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.340
Once more, carefully.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.300
The toss that shows the spiker's 
greatest accuracy and power.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.970
All right, I got it.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.390
Nice receive.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.880
He'll toss to the shrimp 
and fail again.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.690
He should mark Tanaka-san instead.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.100
You come here, too!

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.900
The wall...

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:41.710
Listen.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.860
If you can't spike it,

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.900
avoid it.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.040
If I can't be as tall as the other players,

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.660
then by even one centimeter, 
one millimeter,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.660
or even one second faster,

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.250
I'll reach the summit.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.590
Then, in that very moment...

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.000
I'll be at the highest place.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.980
A tall, tall wall looms in front of me.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.380
What's the view on the other side?

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.100
What does it look like?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.810
It's a view I could never see on my own.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:18.770
That's ...

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.490
The view from the summit.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.760
All right!

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:14.680

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.680
Hey, hey, hey.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.990
It's not possible to spike 
with your eyes closed.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:18.190
I don't get it.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:20.370
This is kind of becoming amazing.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.380
Bring the next one to me!

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980
Don't get carried away.
