WEBVTT

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.830
I'm sorry.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm sorry, Tanaka-san.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.680
Like I said, don't worry about it.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.340
Never mind me. Are you all right?

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.240
Yes. I rested a little 
on the way here.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.700
I feel better now that 
I'm off the bus.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.880
All right, then.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.240
We're counting on you
 for today's match.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.530
Do it just like the three-on-three.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.420
Let me spike freely like that.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.850
Tanaka.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.580
Don't pressure him.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.950
What? What's that?

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.630
I'll... I'll... I'll do my b...

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.360
First the top, then the bottom!

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.760
You're a busy guy.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.410
There he goes again. How pathetic.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.830
I'm going to knock some 
courage into him.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.830
What are you thinking?

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.540
That kind of thing 
won't work on Hinata.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.080
But we won't know 
'til we try it.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.250
Tanaka! Keep this 
simpleton away from him.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.930
Right.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.140
Haikyu!!

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.520
Episode 6: An Interesting Team

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.270
Hey, that Karasuno team
that's coming today...

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.930
isn't that where you-know-who is?

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.710
Who?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.700
The King of the Court.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.980
You went to the same junior high 
he did, didn't you, Kindaichi?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.340
Oh, you mean Kageyama?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.090
He's no big deal.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820
Sure, he was head and shoulders 
above the rest in skill,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.060
but he's just not cut out 
to be a team player, at all.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.270
He's too self-centered.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.580
I see... I guess since 
he went to Karasuno,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.050
his strength as a player 
must be a thing of the past.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.020
Besides, all I know about Karasuno 
is that their manager is a beauty.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.740
Are you serious?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.450
That's right. She's kind of sexy.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.360
Oh yeah, and there's a riffraff 
kind of guy there, too.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.480
He's got a shaved head, and an 
unpleasant look in his eyes.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.210
He looks real stupid.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.130
Um...

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.260
Don't underestimate us too much,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.100
or we'll eat you alive.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.600
You shouldn't say things 
 like that, Tanaka-san.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.550
Look what you did.
You scared these poor elites.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.070
Now I feel sorry for them.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.480
We're not intimidated.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.740
Who's the guy with the glasses?

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.020
Was there a guy that 
tall at Karasuno?

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.210
Oh, you're right. We should save 
our bullying for the match.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.430
You guys.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.920
I can't let you out of my sight.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.750
We apologize.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.240
Oh, it's all right.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.510
Tanaka, stop that look.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.510
It's been a while, King.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:12.140
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Team

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.780
What sort of dictatorship
 do you belong to these days?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.190
I'm looking forward to 
seeing it in the match.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.060
Yeah.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.180
Why's he pretending to be passive?

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.990
Gymnasium No.3

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.240
H-Huge.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.790
The gym. The people.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.000
Greeting.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.020
Nice to meet you.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.760
Nice to meet you.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.340
Aoba Johsai is known for each 
of its members being highly skilled

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.470
equally in offense and defense.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.020
These guys could go to any school
 and become the ace.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.180
Here goes.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.940
Their powerful blocks are famous.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.330
What's the matter, you two?

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.930
Hinata's here to throw 
them for a loop, right?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.990
We know you're lousy, so we'll 
cover you. Leave it to us.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.870
But when you hit a serve, 
you're on your own.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.750
You'd better not miss.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.640
Just kidding, just kidding. 
A missed serve is no big deal.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800
You don't have to worry about 
a thing, just give them your...

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.000
Huh? Where did Hinata go?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.970
He went to the toilet.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.580
Again?

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.110
This is bad...

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.210
What's the matter with 
these guys from Karasuno?

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.850
All they've got is a big attitude.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.210
That's true.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.810
This guy...

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.100
He was next to Kageyama
 in the junior high match.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.100
His silhouette is like a turnip.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.100
I remember him.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.780
Hey. You're a first-year 
at Karasuno?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.950
Y-Yeah, I am.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.310
Well, then how is Kageyama doing?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.620
Our King seems pompous, as usual.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.470
That's not how he is.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.840
It's not about being pompous.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.510
Under the dictatorship of 
the great King Kageyama,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.260
commoners like me are cruelly oppressed, 
made to bitterly suffer.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.920
Just because he's a little skilled! 
Who does he think he is?

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.580
What did I tell you?

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.230
He's utterly despised.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.840
There's no doubting his skill at receiving, 
blocking, and serving.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.520
That's right. It's aggravating.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.960
But his toss is amazing.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.960
But his toss is the worst.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.570
His toss?

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.150
Is amazing.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.030
You've never spiked one of his tosses
 in a match before, have you?

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.160
They're terrible. 
They're too difficult to spike.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.080
Is that so?

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.520
Because he's a self-centered king.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.160
He's a setter, and yet he can't do
his most important job.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.800
Letting the spiker spike the ball.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.920
What Kageyama needs are pawns 
he can maneuver as he wills.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.270
Anything he doesn't need to win,
 he discards.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.900
Let's wait until the match
 to see if Kageyama

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.860
is still the same as he was
in junior high, turnip-kun.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.010
Huh?

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.300
Right, Hinata?

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.240
"Anything he doesn't need to win,
 he discards."

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.290
If I goofed in Kageyama's sight...

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.820
Get lost. You're useless.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.170
Players will get switched.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.690
My stomach hurts.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.750
We look forward to it.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.490
Hinata, you don't have 
to be so nervous. Relax.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.640
Yes. I will do my best to relax.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.840
Hinata, hurry up and 
get in uniform.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.320
Hey manager,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.170
is there anything effective you 
could say to that first-year?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.870
Y-Yes...

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.980
Hey, there.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.400
I'm counting on you.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.410
And that just dealt the death blow. 
I'm sorry, Hinata.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.370
Aoba Johsai              Karasuno

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.330
We will now begin the practice 
match of Karasuno High School

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.580
versus Aoba Johsai High School.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.590
Let's play.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.590
That shrimp is a middle blocker?

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.990
That's gotta be some kind of mistake.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.510
That's Kageyama for real. 
What's he doing at Karasuno?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.300
Who knows?

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.020
Hey, Hinata. Buck up.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.720
Y-Yes.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.020
I will do my best to buck up.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.160
No, I need you to relax.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.600
Hey, Hinata. You know the drill.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.500
The same as in the 
three-on-three match.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.960
I-I know that.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.080
Are you sure?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.530
Matsukawa, nice serve.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.740
All right, I got this.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.120
Idiot, that obviously 
wasn't your ball.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.360
I'm sorry.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360
Ennoshita, cover.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.790
Tanaka.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:42.790
Yeah.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.170
And that's the first point.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.780
Don't mind, don't mind.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.210
Hinata, relax and stay aware 
of your surroundings.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.050
I'm sorry.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.510
This guy... 
He's completely overwhelmed.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.390
Hinata!

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.100
Let's relax, first and foremost.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.660
All right. Lucky, lucky.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.740 line:50 %
Aoba Johsai      Karasuno

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:11.880
Touch-net.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.740
And Karasuno's score 
finally changes.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.450
Hey, you! That's enough nervousness!

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.890
No! Give me another chance!

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.890
They're really not a big deal.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.410
He sure hasn't changed, at all.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.890
All right. 
Let's steadily rack up points.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.830
The next serve will be...

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.300
This couldn't be timed worse...

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.300
Aoba Johsai              Karasuno

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.640
It's Hinata's serve.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.950
A serve-miss is an immediate 
score for the opponent.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.950
Hinata, relax!

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.530
If I miss, the first 
set will be finished.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.500
Kageyama. Is he still breathing?

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.570
Can he do this?

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.350
How am I supposed to know?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.360
Anything he doesn't need to win,
 he discards.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.180
Don't blow it.
 I'll have to sit out if I blow it.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.360
Relax. It's all right. 
It's all right. It's all...

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.530
Crap, it didn't hit my hand right.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.570
Aoba Johsai      Karasuno

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.330
Crap.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:47.610
Hey.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.270
Nice headshot, man!

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.210
Is your head okay?

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.040
Don't razz him.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.500
Stop it, you guys.

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.710
Now I've done it.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.380
Hey, Kageyama.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.810
W-W-Wait. Once we talk about this,
 you'll understand.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.260
Kageyama.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.270
Stop.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.090
Just wondering...

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:24.530
Yes?

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.270
Why are you so intimidated? 
Why are you so nervous?

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.950
Is it because the 
opponents are tall?

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.750
Is it because this is your 
first practice match?

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.030
There's nothing scarier than hitting a serve
 into the back of my head...

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:42.880
Is there?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.060
I can't think of anything.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.990
In that case, you have no reason 
to be nervous any more.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.690
Because you've already done it...

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.060
The scariest thing possible.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.480
So now...

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.150
Get back to normal, you jackass.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.430
Was that goof "safe"?

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.280
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.200
If that was safe, it doesn't 
matter what I did here.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.910
Why was I intimidated by 
that turnip-head anyway?

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.540
But we lost the first set 
because of what I just did.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.130
Even if Kageyama is okay with it...

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.130
Hey, you. Hinata.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.670
You.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.390
Yes.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.630
Are you thinking you have 
to play well, like the others?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.190
As if you have the experience?

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.020
If I don't, I'll get switched 
with another player.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.590
I want to be in the match to the end.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.250
Hey. Don't underestimate us.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.400
We all know you're a lousy player.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.700
Daichi-san knows it, 
and yet he lets you play.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:48.280
Huh?

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.220
As for getting switched 
for another player...

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.460
Think about it when you get switched!

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.210
Huh?

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.760
So don't worry about something 
that hasn't happened yet.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.410
Shouldn't you jump in?

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.570
Oh, yes. But I think 
it's all right.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.680
You don't have any brains for that.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.050
Listen to me. In volleyball,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.260
everybody on this side 
of the net is your ally.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.250
It doesn't matter if you're lousy. 
It doesn't matter if you're a nuisance.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.790
You can slow us down. That's okay.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.770
But to make up for those things...

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.730
That's why you have your team
 and your senpais.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.980
Oh!

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.670
Go on. Call me Tanaka-senpai.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.930
Tanaka-senpai.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.770
Once more.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.970
He just wants to be called "senpai."

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.950
Tanaka-senpai.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.120
Yeah, but Tanaka was really
helpful just now.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.890
His speech was totally effective 
because he seems to have

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.580
no ulterior motive.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.040
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.040
What's this?

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.240
I hear it's a practice match.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.760
The second set is about to start.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.550
Hey, teach me later how to serve
 to the back of the head.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.720
Teach me later, too.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.180
Ennoshita, nice serve.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.770
You'll do the same as in the 
three-on-three match.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:04.890
You go in max speed and jump and 
swing where there is no blocker.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.420
Just be careful you don't 
bump into other spikers.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.200
Yeah.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.120
Kunimi.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.720
Kageyama, cover.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.120
Yes.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.640
Left, go forward.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.570
Right.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.380
There's no quick...maybe it'll 
be open, from left or right...

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.960
What?

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.010
A quick?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:28.720
What?

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.760
It didn't hit my hand.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.400
They do quick?

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.380
Or was that just a bluff?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.100
Either way...

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.190
If you can't spike a ball like that,
 the King will get mad.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.360
Hinata.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.070
You see?

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.030
My bad. That toss was too high.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.240
Kageyama...

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.950
...apologized?

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.150
I'll try to forgive you.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.130
Ouch! Ouch! Kageyama, I'll go bald.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.680
One point.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:07.380
Nice serve.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.840
All right.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.970
All right.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.010
The right and setter moved.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.470
Bring it.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.010
The left is waiting.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.680
Who will Kageyama use?

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.370
Now. Right there.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.610
Oh. Huh?

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.070
Yes.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:26.020
Yes.

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:26.980
Yes.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.950
There it is,
 the freak toss-and-spike.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.620
Did you see that? That was fast.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.910
Hinata, Kageyama.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.660
One-two...

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.750
Yeah!

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.550
It's like team spirit!

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.960
Huh?

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.170
Not like. It's a for real.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.340
Right, right.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.330
Nice toss, Kageyama.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:54.270
Thanks.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.490
Hey, does that shrimp 
do fast attacks?

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.820
Let's do another one.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.570
Yup.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.970
He's changed from the first set.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.180
Good, lost your cool? 
Lost your cool?

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.350
You'd better keep your eyes on Hinata.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.490
Hinata is back in action.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.940
Time for a counterattack.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.610
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.860
Chance ball.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.830
All right.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.280
If I know it's coming...

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.950
there's nothing to fear.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.950
Oh, yeah?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.710
I was waiting for this.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.300
Damn. The shrimp was just a decoy.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.870
I thought it was coming to me.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.630
How do you like me now, turnip-kun?

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.300
I told you we'd get 
you in the match.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.660
I thought I was going to 
spike it, and said, "Oh, yeah?"

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.570
I'm so embarrassed.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.270
That's how it's supposed to be.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.480
You jumped for real, so the 
opponents reacted for real.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.770
That's how it is?

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.150
That's how it is.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.420
Damn.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.070
Don't sweat it, Kindaichi.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.260
We have our attack strategy. 
Don't let them get to you.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:57.870
Right.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.080
I'm just a bystander and I can 
see how the blockers disperse.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.130
I didn't know Karasuno 
had such a strong team.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.130
Hinata, you idiot.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.800
But they make a lot of mistakes, too.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.310
Huddle.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.520
Right.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.150
What's the matter, Hinata?

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.970
When I entered a tournament 
for the first time,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.700
I thought I had to do everything 
right all by myself.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.310
But now, there are players who are 
way better than me all around me.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:45.140
So all I can do now is 
believe in them, and jump.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.290
I didn't have to overthink anything
 in the first place.

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.120
You're late.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.920
But it's believing and jumping 
that are your powerful weapons.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.030
Hey, Kindaichi. 
Kageyama isn't like you said.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.930
I wasn't expecting that, either. 
I can't believe there's a spiker

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.680
who can synch with 
his reckless tosses.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.390
I don't think so.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.360
#5 isn't looking 
at the ball at all.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.960
Coach, what do you mean?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.530
I think Kageyama
 pinpoint-tossed the ball

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.920
directly where he was about to swing.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.790
Is that kind of thing possible?

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.550
Kageyama? Matching someone else?

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.460
That can only mean
 that #5 has the ability

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.860
to make that self-centered 
and prideful

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:37.630
Wanna drink? Oh, sorry. 
Your face is lower than I thought...

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.630
Kageyama do what he's been doing.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:43.390
What's amazing is that he jumps 
believing in Kageyama 100%.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.140
He believes that's where 
the ball will come.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.710
If they get past your block, 
receive solidly.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.640
You're all the best 
members of our team.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.100
Show your pride.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.000
Yes.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.810
Kageyama is amazing.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.870
It's a shame we couldn't 
have him on our team.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.870
He did get invited, didn't he?

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.580
Yeah, but even if Kageyama 
had come to our team,

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.900
that doesn't mean he 
would've played like that.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.340
Huh?

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.690
Maybe Kageyama is how he is 
now because of Karasuno,

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.650
All right. Let's win this set.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.980
Ouch. That hurt, Kageyama.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.300
and because of #5.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.300
A shot in the arm, 
a shot in the arm.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.150
All right. It's starting.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.470
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:27.470
Chance ball.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.830
Tsukishima.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.500
All right.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.810
Tsukki, nice!

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.690
Nice, Tsukishima.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.170
Your tosses are too accurate. 
It gives me the creeps.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:39.740
What?

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.950
I wouldn't have put it that way,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.710
I can just aim at your 
glasses, if you like.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.570
but I can sort of understand 
what Tsukishima means.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.020
Try it. You'll get banished 
from the gym again.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.930
It's like you're wishing the 
ball would go somewhere,

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.070
and then it just appears there.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.350
I'll do it so no one will notice.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:51.720
You obviously can't do that.
 Are you stupid?

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.710
It's totally amazing. But...

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.040
We're in a match.
That's about enough.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
Tanaka, nice serve.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.650
Nice serve.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.760
I see...

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:14.980
WS Ennoshita    MB Tsukishima   S Kageyama
 WS Sawamura   MB Hinata    WS Tanaka

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:14.980 position:20% line:50%
S Sugawara 
MB Yamaguchi 
 WS Kinoshita 
 MB Narita

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.320
The rotation moves every time 
we score and we get to serve.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.770
So now it's Kageyama-kun and 
Ennoshita-kun in front position.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.980
Yes, it's the exact opposite 
positioning from the start of the match.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.890
When Hinata-kun is in front position,
 his being a decoy

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.960
raises the level of the 
entire team's offense.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.990
On the other hand,
 if Tsukishima-kun is in front...

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.410
we'll have a powerful block 
equal to the Seijo team's.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.660
You're good at blocking, too, huh?

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.670
But don't get too carried away.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.170
Don't get too full of yourself, 
being all gangly like that.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.530
Don't fight, guys. Okay?

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.840
Your opponents are on the 
other side of the net!

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.810
Hey, here it comes.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.710
All right.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.020
Hey. I'm the one that blocked it.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.770
What? It hit my hand, too.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.230
That's enough you two!

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.820
Serves those guys right.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.430
What are you grinning at?

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.410
Kageyama, stop it.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.410
Damn. Now I'm getting worried.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.410
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.340
Hey, that was covered for 
you Kunimi, you idiot.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.810
We have to stop #5 somehow.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:25.000
True, the combo of #5 
and Kageyama is formidable.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.740
But then again, 
though he has no calm,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.720
that spiker, Tanaka-kun, 
is an overwhelming force.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.560
Then there's that somewhat uninspired 
but clever blocker, Tsukishima-kun.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.020
And the captain, Sawamura-kun, 
who covers all his team's holes.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.920
Bring it on.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.820
There are those who 
are inexperienced,

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:46.110
and their defense is full of holes,

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.630
but their offense 
is freely flexible,

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.780
and makes full use of 
the inexperienced.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.200
They made a fool of us...

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.080
So this is Karasuno.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.540
They are odd.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.520
They are dangerous.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.800
They are an interesting team.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.920
Karasuno              Aoba Johsai

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.500
They won the set.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.450
Damn.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.780
Nice toss, Kageyama.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.520
Oh, thanks.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.910
On to winning the final set!

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.890
I'm glad they don't have another 
serve-hitter like Kageyama.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:19.390
A comeback victory.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.820
Victory.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.390
Yeah, because I must admit our 
team is not good at receiving.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:32.990
Victory.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.550
Thank you.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:26.760
We mustn't let our guard down.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.850
I'm thinking that maybe

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:32.990
their setter wasn't 
the main setter...

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.330
Oikawa, you're back.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.220
Next Episode Preview

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.260
What? Seijo's setter wasn't 
the main setter?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.560
Who is that sneering dude, anyway?

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.230
Kageyama, you know him?

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.350
Well, you'll have to wait and see.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.190
What?

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.980
