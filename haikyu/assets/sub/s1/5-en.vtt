WEBVTT

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.530
I must be aware...

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.400
of the ball,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.780
the blockers,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.070
and the spikers.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.590
I can't overlook even the slightest movement.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.500
With perfect timing, I must find

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.040
the highest point of the spiker's strike...

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.660
And capture it!

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.780
Again.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.870
Another point!

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.290
They've turned it around.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.090
Kageyama-Hinata     Tsukishima-Yamaguchi

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.090
One more point and 
they'll take the first set.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.800
His tosses get more accurate every time.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.560
We're seeing Kageyama's 
true abilities as a setter.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.060
Score.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.000
That was awesome, man.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.770
But the one who pulled it all out of him...

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.480
...was Hinata.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.400
Scored again!

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.140
Haikyu!!

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.540
Episode 5: A Coward's Anxiety

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.920
<i>He sure hung in there...</i>

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.110
I've never seen anyone take 
a toss to the face.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.010
You're not scoring any more.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.980
Come to me!

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.560
He's untouchable when he spikes free.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.630
Damn.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.880
How do you like me now, Tsukishima?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.030
Weren't you going to crush me and Hinata?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.610
That's right. That's right.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.940
Try it if you can.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.170
Try it.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.290
Why are you bragging the most, Tanaka?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.320
That's right. You're scoring 
thanks to the first-years.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.580
You have a big attitude.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.990
Don't take off your shirt, baldie.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.970
Who's trash-talking me over there?!

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.920
Frankly, if they can't stop 
Kagaeyama and Hinata's attacks,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.230
Tsukishima's team is going down.
They lack conviction.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.920
Starting the second set.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.030
Let's go.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.770
Right.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.820
Tsukishima-Yamaguchi     Kageyama-Hinata

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.500
All right.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.080
Tsukishima-Yamaguchi     Kageyama-Hinata

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.580
Tsukishima-Yamaguchi     Kageyama-Hinata

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.660
Tsukishima-Yamaguchi     Kageyama-Hinata

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.330
Kageyama is amazing,

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.400
but it be really taxing to keep
 making such accurate tosses.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.070
Hinata's looking tired
 from moving around so much.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.030
Yeah, but...

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.820
Yes.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.860
I think they're having fun.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.680
Tsukishima-Yamaguchi     Kageyama-Hinata

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.550
Good job.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.510
Da... Daichi-san, Suga-san,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.010
did you two know
 those two could attack like that,

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.470
when you said what you said?

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.280
Huh?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.410
If we can utilize that combination...

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.940
Karasuno will make explosive improvement.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.440
Can't we use it to our advantage, some how?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.250
Of course not.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.900
I just meant he should give Hinata tosses
 he'd have no trouble spiking.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.950
I thought maybe Hinata could get used
 to Kageyama's somewhat reckless tosses...

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.300
But that isn't exactly what happened.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.840
I was hoping they would
 simply fight together,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.760
but they actually made
 each other stronger.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.400
Hinata is raw, but he has 
natural speed and jumping ability.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.770
Then Kageyama perfectly utilizes
 Hinata's abilities with his finely-honed skill.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.710
The two of them bring out 
 the best in each other.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.800
Why? We don't have to.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.200
As a duo, they may exceed all expectations.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.080
Yes, we do.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.200
All right. Let's go.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.630
Tsukishima.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.120
What?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.230
We're supposed to shake hands 
before and after a match.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.190
Though we didn't do that at first today.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.050
Besides, we're teammates now.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.130
Though that doesn't make me happy.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.570
Hurry up.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.940
Don't you know?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.140
They'll kick you out the gym 
if you don't show team spirit.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.730
The reason why you two got kicked out

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.560
was because you ignored the captain,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.480
started your own competition, and finally,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.620
blew the dean's rug off his head.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.320
N-Never mind the minor details.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.580
Shake hands.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.730
Wh-What are you doing?

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.120
What are those first-years doing?

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.820
Are you all right, Tsukki?

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.010
Tsukishima.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.790
How did you like the three-on-three?

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.440
It made no difference to me.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.920
He's a king from an elite school, anyway.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.800
There's nothing strange about 
commoners losing to him.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:54.960
Hmm...

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.950
But then again,

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.750
you played pretty seriously.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.940
Here.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.780
Captain.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.740
What?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.680
Club Application
Volleyball
First-Year, Class 3
Kageyama Tobio

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.680
Club Application
Volleyball
First-Year, Class 1
Hinata Shoyo

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.710
Shimizu.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.170
The stuff is here, right?

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.130
What?

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.180
Karasuno High School
Volleyball Club

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.900
I think they should fit, but 
let me know if you need anything.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.150
Thanks.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.380
Come on. Put it on.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.840
No, I'll do it later...

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.460
Are you shy or something?

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.110
Never mind. Wear it.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.080
Wear it. Wear it. Wear it.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.840
Looks good on you.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.210
Yeah, looks good. Looks good.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.920
We're the Karasuno Volleyball Club
 from here on...

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.170
Ready, and...

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.760
Good to have you with us.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.470
Thanks!

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.590
Anyway, got that out of the way.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.870
Suga, you and Tanaka helped 
them out, didn't you?

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.070
Oh? No, not really.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.510
Anyway, it all worked out.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.280
Thanks.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.450
Good job.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.710
What? Hey.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.920
Hey, Hinata, are you rested? 
You ready to go?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.320
Let's practice "quick" again.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.820
Let's do it while you're still in the zone.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.670
Yeah.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.880
Tanaka-san, please bring the balls.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.380
You're moving around already?

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.310
It's decided! It's decided!

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.570
The practice match.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.500
It's against one of the top four teams
 in the prefecture.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.980
Aoba Josai High School.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.190
The one nicknamed Seijo?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.770
Yikes.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.770
No way.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.240
A practice match with
 one of the top four!

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.520
Aoba Josai...

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.290
Oh. You two are the controversial 
Hinata-kun and Kageyama-kun.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.990
Who's he? A teacher?

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.750
I dunno.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.600
I'm the volleyball club advisor
 starting this year.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.080
I'm Takeda Ittetsu.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.960
Hello.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.590
I have no volleyball experience, 
so I can't help with your technique,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.200
but for anything else,
 I'll do my very best.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.050
It's good to meet you.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.390
Yes.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.060
Sensei.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.940
Ah.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.660
I've been running around everywhere 
setting up the practice-match.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.730
I haven't had time to drop in here.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.170
But, sensei, how did you get 
a powerhouse like Seijo to agree?

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.470
You didn't get on your knees 
and beg again, did you?

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.920
No, no.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.380
I'm good at getting on my knees and begging,

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.790
but I didn't do that this time.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.280
But they had a condition.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.950
A condition?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.550
Kageyama-kun must play setter
 the entire game.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.440
What's that about?

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.510
Sounds like they're not 
interested in Karasuno.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.670
They just want to assess Kageyama.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.560
Are they underestimating us?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.000
Are they?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.260
Well, that's not quite how it is.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.450
Sounds good.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.310
We don't get chances like this that often.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:25.750
You're going to agree to that, Suga-san?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.390
You're the official setter 
of Karasuno, Suga-san.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.150
I...

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.430
I want to see how effective 
Hinata and Kageyama's

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.400
attack will be against
a top four team.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.280
Sensei, may we have the details?

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.500
Sure. Um... the schedule is rather sudden, 
but it's set for Tuesday next week.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.960
It'll be after classes, so there
will only be time for one game.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.150
We'll rent the bus after school...

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.150
A match.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.670
A match.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.140
It's going to be my first 
official match at Karasuno,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.110
with a full team!

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.600
So make sure you're not late.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.460
Yes.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.690
Good job.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:07.760
Good job.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.540
Sugawara-san.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.710
I have to play setter by default this time,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.450
but from now on I will earn my place.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.150
Huh?

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.340
Huh?

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.160
Oh, I thought you weren't 
concerned about me at all.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.170
I wasn't expecting that.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.770
Why would you say that?

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.770
Because you're superior to me 
in athleticism and talent.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.500
You can't make up for a lack
 of experience that easily!

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.750
And also...

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.670
Suga-san.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.670
Suga.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.650
Sugawara-san.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.260
I h-have to earn...

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.230
...the t-t-trust of the other team members...

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:00.640
That junior high match he was in 
must've really gotten to him.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.570
Therefore,

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.780
I will never give up.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.290
Yeah. I won't give up, either.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.130
Suga-san.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:12.680
Daichi-san said he'll buy us pork buns.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.960
But you know, Kageyama,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:21.420
Foothill Store

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.440
Aoba Josai is where most of the athletes
 from Kitagawa Daiichi move on to, right?

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.420
Yeah, you could say that.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.990
That means Kageyama's 
former teammates are at that school.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.630
I'm just wondering if you might
 be uncomfortable with that.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.600
I might be if they were on the same team.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.020
But if they're my opponents, 
I'll fight with all I've got.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.310
I see. I suppose you would.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.100
But are you all right with it, Suga-san?

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.950
I... I... just can't accept it.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.940
Sure, I'm a little mad about it...

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.910
But...

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.310
I also want to show them that 
Kageyama's completely different

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.880
from his junior high days.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.950
That's true.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.340
Plus, we'll show them that Kageyama's 
not the only one they need to worry about.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.300
Right, Hinata?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.910
Why are you eating first?

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.730
Are you kidding?

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.660
Hey, volleyball club!

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.860
Don't make a ruckus in front of the store!

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.040
Sorry.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.290
"Volleyball club"... that's right.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.780
All five of us are
in the volleyball club.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.830
We're on the same team.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.910
Excuse me. Is there a curry pork bun?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.120
Eat your dinner properly.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.850
Hey, you guys come and eat, too.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.840
Thanks.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.980
We're all on the same team.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.980
Kageyama, after you're done eating, 
could I ask you something?

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.760
Sure.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.320
Don't make a ruckus.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.480
I was wondering about Hinata's position 
for the upcoming practice match.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.390
What do you think?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.630
Now, concerning the positions 
for the practice match...

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:19.880
I think this is how we'll do it.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.960
WS Tanaka               MB Hinata            WS Sawamura

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.960
S Kageyama           MB Tsukishima        WS Ennoshita

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.960 position:20% line:50%
S Sugawara 
MB Yamaguchi 
WS Kinoshita 
MB Narita

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.000
I want to use Kageyama and Hinata as a set,

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.450
"Set"...

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.640
and Tsukishima is one
 of our few tall players.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.480
I want to see how
 you'll fight against Seijo.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.180
Yes.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.140
I'm the only first-year out of the loop.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.720
You're using Hinata in a 
position where height matters?

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.180
Middle blocker?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.360
I'm in the same position as 
the lanky jerk Tsukishima?

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.320
Volleyball
HOW
TO

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.320
Oh, j-just a second. 
Can I read up on the positions?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.410
Setter (S)

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.320
Setter:

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.410
The control tower that tosses for spikes,
 and organizes the offense.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.370
Wing Spiker (WS)

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.370
Wing spiker:

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.460
An all-around, well-balanced player 
who attacks the core of the opponents.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.500
Middle Blocker (MB)

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.420
Middle blocker:

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.050
He defends against the opponent's offense,
 and scores points, mainly using "quick."

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.930
Furthermore, he plays the decoy 
to draw the opponent's blockers away.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.300
Would you say these are right?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.120
There are other exclusively 
defensive positions, too,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.640
but for now, those are all.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.690
Listen, Hinata...

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.900
You're the ultimate decoy.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.400
The ultimate...

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.020
...decoy?

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.700
There's something uninspiring about that.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.010
We'll let you score lots 
of points using "quick,"

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:39.190
and direct the opponent's
 blockers' attention to you.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.580
That's when the other spikers 
will come into play.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.700
Oh.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:49.320
Big guys like Tsukishima will fall 
like idiots to your movements...

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.680
That'll feel good, won't it?

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.860
I like it. I like it a lot.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.980
Hey. Are you calling Tsukki an idiot?

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.900
Shut up, Yamaguchi.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.100
Sorry, Tsukki.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.440
On the other hand, if you're not effective,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.770
know that the other attacks will all fail.

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.200
Hey...

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.450
Don't put so much pressure on him.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.040
All fail... all fail... all fail...

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:17.410
All fail     All fail

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.410
You see?

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.620
What about blocking, though?

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.750
Even if he can jump high,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:28.020
the taller players will reach
 the highest point of their jump faster.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:32.190
Yes, the reason we want Hinata 
to be the focus of blockers

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.400
isn't to smack down the opponent's spikes,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.480
but to touch them.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:39.970
With Hinata's crazy reflexes and speed,

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.730
he can touch the opponent's spikes, 
and slow down their momentum.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.230
We'll set the pace to our advantage, 
and make our counterattack.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.360
It's not going to go that smoothly
 right off the bat.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.510
It probably won't.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.110
Huh?

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.570
Right off the bat, anyway.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.600
But we should still try it.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.370
Maybe we'll learn something as we go along.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.410
It's a practice match, after all.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.730
Fine.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:07.300
Anyway, for in-air battles,
 we've only got Tsukishima and Kageyama

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.830
who can match Hinata's jumps.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.800
So, Hinata, have confidence, and...

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.750
Yes! I'll do my best!

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.760
I'll score lots of points. I'll be a decoy.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.240
I'll serve. Block. Quick. Everything.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.240
Hey, hey, calm down!

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.770
He blew a fuse!
 Hinata blew a fuse!

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.820
Sawamura.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.030
Hey, Michimiya.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.190
What?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.580
I heard you're having a match 
against Seijo tomorrow?

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.070
I'm surprised they agreed to it.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.790
Yeah. Takeda-sensei did 
the hard work for us.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.660
But aren't you scared?

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.180
Hm?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.820
Seijo was in the prefecture's 
top four last year, weren't they?

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.920
Won't they beat the crap out of us?

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.410
Well, we actually have some rather 
interesting first-years...

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.820
I heard about them.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:02.260
As soon as they joined the club, 
they blew off the dean's rug...

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.010
D-Don't!

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.000
Shh.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:13.570
They're still imperfect, but if 
those guys start playing their part,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.180
I feel Karasuno is going 
to improve explosively.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.150
That's what I think.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.000
Wow...

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.260
Are first-years allowed to use the club room?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.020
Of course. It doesn't matter.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.080
Hey.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.630
Hey.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.540
Hello there.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.000
Oh...

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.230
There's nothing impressive about this place.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.470
It's just an ordinary club room.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.370
I've never been in a club room before.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.810
The Little Giant used 
this room, too, didn't he?

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.640
Tomorrow's finally your 
debut battle, Hinata.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.850
Even though it's a practice match.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.360
Seijo's gym is huge.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.990
Their players are huge, too. 
Don't get intimidated.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.870
Hey.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:58.570
Hey.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:00.200
Hello.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.930
In...

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:01.530
In?

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.870
Intimidated? Of course I won't be.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.460
I'll do great. You'll see...

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.580
Hey, Hinata.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.830
You're putting your jacket on first...

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.880
What's that? A fashion statement?

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.590
Kageyama, is Hinata going
 to be all right tomorrow?

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.560
Who're you trying to look like?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.010
Will he be all right? 
What do you mean?

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.020
Hinata's only experience is at 
that one match in junior high.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.600
Is that how you get dressed?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.980
No, it's not. I was daydreaming. That's all.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.980
I think he's really anxious
and worried because of that.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.490
That's why I think he 
might be quite nervous.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.090
But everyone feels nervous...

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.910
You make light of the 
anxiety we cowards feel.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.210
No matter what I say, it adds pressure.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.850
Hinata.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.190
Here's the key to the club room.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.880
Don't worry. I'll bring it with me.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.630
I never told you where to keep it,
 so I brought it with me.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.790
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.770
You can't help it at first.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.210
I think it's best to leave him alone.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:04.800
I wonder...

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:09.110
I have to do it right tomorrow...

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.940
This isn't going to be like junior high, 
or like the three-on-three the other day,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.900
because I can be replaced.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.040
I don't want that. 
I don't want to be replaced.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.250
I'm finally going to stand on the court
 with a full team.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.910
I want to be out there 'til the end.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.830
I can't goof up. I can't goof up.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.470
I can't goof up.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.970
Whoops, sorry. You're so 
small I couldn't see you.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.770
I can't goof up. I can't goof up.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.050
What's that all about?

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.390
Who knows?

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.710
Hey, Kageyama.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.000
Don't make any wisecracks 
that'll put more pressure on him.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.990
Wisecracks?

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.830
Have I ever made any wisecracks?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720
I have no recollection whatsoever.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.410
He has no self-awareness.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:16.580
Hinata.

You're wearing my pants!

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.230
What are you doing Tanaka? You pervert!

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.980
Are you stupid? You're the worst.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.020
I can't sleep.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:43.240
I can't sleep.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.730

Hey, Hinata. I'll give you something to eat.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:18.080
What is that look on your face?

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.990
I couldn't sleep last night...

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.970
The window... can I open the window?

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.730
