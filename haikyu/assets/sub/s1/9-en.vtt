WEBVTT

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.530
One more! Give me another!

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.320
Shut up. I know that.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.010
Here goes.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.800
Yeah.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.740
Gosh, that feels good.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.950
I feel the heft of the ball,
 snug in my palm.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.660
I love that.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.210
All right.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.270
We'll use our quick offense against Neko!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.750
Neko?

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.990
A match against Nekoma?

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.910
It'll be a practice match 
 on the last day of Golden Week.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.790
Yikes.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.850
What do you mean, "yikes"? 
Hey, don't run away.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.940
But you're scary when you get mad.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.560
I'm not mad right now.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.910
Well, Nekoma sounds
 like ancient history to us.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.030
Our generation doesn't have the same
Karasuno-Nekoma rivalry.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.710
Although... "Cat vs Raven:
 Battle at the Garbage Dump."

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.850
We've heard the stories about Neko.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.280
It'll be our fist match with them in years.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.200
It does pique your interest, doesn't it?

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.720
But I've lost face with Suga and Nishinoya.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.180
You're too much.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.010
You're still a goofball 
in a big body, as usual.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.360
What a contrast to Nishinoya.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.400
Can't you sugarcoat your words a little?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.880
Don't worry about Suga and Nishinoya. 
They're fine.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.390
Unlike you, they have big hearts.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.330
I always thought of you as a kind person... 
Was I wrong?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.340
I'm kind to everyone, except you.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.540
Because you're a goofball.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.500
You ditched us for a whole month, 
you complain about your anxiety...

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.630
but those things don't matter to me.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.510
If you still like volleyball,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.220
that's reason enough to come back.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.640
Oh, yeah.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.000
We've got a guy who 
hopes to become the ace.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.010
Ouch.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.100
Haikyu!!

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.620
Foothill Store

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.620
By the shores of the 
coursing Hirose River,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.160
Episode 9:  A Toss to the Ace

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.000
memories do not return.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.970
Amidst the dancing lights of Hayase...

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.140
Wh-What are you doing?

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.940
I'm sorry. I was checking to see
 if you had any customers.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.950
You're here about the coaching 
thing again, aren't you?

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.980
Yes.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.420
I still like to play.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.870
I even have a local team.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.600
But I don't want to coach. It's stuffy.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.570
I see...

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.080
And I don't want to go 
to that gymnasium, either.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.950
D-Do you have bad memories or something?

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.400
The very opposite.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.240
The place is filled with 
fond memories of my youth.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.900
Then, why?

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.940
That gym and club room may still be the same,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.240
but I can never go back.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.880
It was a limited time with 
its own distinctive feel.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.790
The atmosphere belongs 
to that place and time alone.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.590
So it's nostalgia.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.600
How nice.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.350
Shut up.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.520
That's why I don't want to go back.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.940
Even if Nekoma High School were coming?

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.210
We're having a practice match

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.380
at the end of Golden Week. 
The first match in five years.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.910
B-But wh-why now?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.620
Their director, Nekomata, who was 
close friends with Director Ukai,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.520
just came out of retirement.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.920
When I heard that, I requested 
a practice match.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.880
When you were there, Ukai-kun,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.220
wasn't that when the Nekoma rivalry 
was at its peak?

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.880
Yeah.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.530
And I hear their coach now was 
Nekoma's setter seven or eight years ago.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.810
This year is our last chance, Ukai.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.140
Promise to definitely, 
<i>definitely</i> see us at the nationals.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.020
Yeah.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.490
I promise.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.950
That was when you were playing, too.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.480
Maybe you know him?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.160
Hey...

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.020
You trying to seduce me?

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.670
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.770
Are you kidding?

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.720
You think I'll fall for such an obvious ploy?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.260
What time does practice start?

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.050
I'm sor— Huh?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.050
Um...

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.260
So Nekoma is coming.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.320
I can't let them see my successors 
in a pitiful state.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.420
I'm gearing up. 
Go there and wait.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.780
Y-Yes.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.770
Mom! Mind the store for me.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.780
All right.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.660
Hello, Tatsu-san?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.120
Maturing to Greatness

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.330
Say, Noya-san.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.300
Huh?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.790
What kind of training did you 
do while you were suspended?

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.500
Hm, mainly block-follow.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.960
Training for saving balls 
after they're blocked.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.690
I still can't do it well, 
but if I get good at block-follow,

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.680
you guys can spike with greater confidence.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.720
This guy...

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.310
He has a new bruise every time I see him.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.470
Noya-san, are you for real? 
You're such an awesome guy.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.020
What're you crying about?

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.480
Good job, everyone.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.860
Huddle up.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.630
Let me introduce you.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.530
This is Ukai-kun, who will 
be our coach starting today.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.830
C-Coach?

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.550
Is this true?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.640
Only 'til the match against Nekoma.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.380
Oh...

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.050
But this is the guy from Foothill Store.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.730
He's really a coach?

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.620
He's a senpai to all of you.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.530
He's the grandson of Director Ukai.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.980
What?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.330
But that's not the name on your store.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.270
The store's named after 
my mother's side of the family.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.980
We got no time to waste.
Let's get started.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.400
I want to see what you guys are made of.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.880
The game will start at 6:30 PM.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.760
The opponents have already been invited.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.740
Huh? Opponents?

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.940
The Karasuno neighborhood association team.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.410
If you still like volleyball,

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.880
that's reason enough to come back.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.090
Here goes.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.950
Okay!

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.790
Here goes.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.350
Damn, they're not coming.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.830
I guess it's impossible 
to get everyone on a weekday.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.650
Here.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.860
Thank you very much.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.470
Hey.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.350
Hey.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.210
Wow.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.560
Brings back memories.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.190
Um...

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.460
The team Neighborhood Association...

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.800
...is here!

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.590
Hey, guys, thanks for coming on short notice.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.720
I was expecting geezers from 
a neighborhood association.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.510
Me, too.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.970
All right!

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.170
Let's get started.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.680
Yeah.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.240
It's a match!

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.170
Hey, you. What's the matter?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.020
Oh, I'm sorry. He's sort of...

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.440
What? He has a problem? Is he injured?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.870
No, it's not that kind of thing...

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.370
What, you're not injured?

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.940
Whatever the case,
 I need you on the neighborhood team.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.430
Their libero has to work. 
He couldn't make it.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.870
Well, maybe...

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.170
We need two more.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.540
How many extras have you got?

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.300
Hey, it's Asahi-san!

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.220
Asahi-san!

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.210
This guy again...

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.320
I... I... um...

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.180
Asahi-san?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.870
You're late! Who do you think you are?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.020
What's your position?

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.980
Wing spiker...

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.900
We're short of players.
Hurry up and take your position!

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.060
Chop chop!

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.910
All we need is another setter.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.800
I wish I could do it, 
but I have to watch the game.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.260
I need to borrow a setter from you guys.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.560
Sugawara-san.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.020
You're not doing this for me, are you?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.490
If you're stepping down
 so I can step up, I'll refuse.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.100
Ever since Kageyama joined 
the team as official setter,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.500
I've been relieved.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.260
The setter is the pillar 
of our team's offense.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.460
He must be the toughest of everyone.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.170
But I never felt confident 
about throwing tosses.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.800
I've been scared

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.120
the spikers would repeatedly 
be blocked because of my tosses.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.560
So I hid behind Kageyama's 
overwhelming abilities,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.840
and enjoyed the relief.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.900
When I think of spikes getting blocked...

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.490
It still scares me.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.450
But...

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.530
Let me toss to you again, Asahi.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.030
That's why I'll be on their team.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.710
Kageyama.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.460
I won't let you outplay me.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.790
I won't, either.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.440
Nishinoya, I'm counting 
on your nice receives.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.550
That goes without saying.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.650
All right. Let's get ready.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.260
Asahi-san's here. Right?

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.680
Yeah. For now, anyway.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.150
Karasuno     Neighborhood Assoc.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.540
Let's play.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.110
They definitely have an 
intimidating presence.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.070
Let's do it, high schoolers.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.950
It's a battle against the ace...

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.170 line:20%
Karasuno     Neighborhood Assoc.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.170
Nice receive.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.230
Hey, good one. Nice toss.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.980
Thank you very much.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.340
Sugawara-san's fast attack!

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.940
Of course. Suga is an 
experienced setter, after all.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.900
He looks happy...

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.730
Suga-san, nice toss!

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.420
Yeah.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.190
But the neighborhood folks are 
skillfully accommodating me.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.120
They're veterans, for sure.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.280
All right.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.080
My tosses still need a lot of work.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.820
But, I have to use lots of fast attacks,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.310
and confidently keep building offense.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.420
Otherwise, the whole match will be 
on the ace's shoulders again.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.420
Suga-san, you've become awesome.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.050
Huh? Really?

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.430
That's high praise coming 
from you, Nishinoya.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.600
Why's that?

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.740
Oh, well...

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.110
Suga, you've grown dependable
 in the short time I've been away.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.570
And Nishinoya is dependable, as usual.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.570
No, seriously, you've become awesome.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.130
I, on the other hand,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.650
came moseying back, and am standing 
on the court without a purpose.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.040
I feel pathetic.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:33.710
But...

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.740
Nice serve.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.670
One more.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.130
But...

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.130
I like being here.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.260
What was that?

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.760
All right!

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:51.760
Yes.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.260
That was an amazing jump.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.730
Amazing. That toss was perfection itself.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.400
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:04.710
But now I have this guy tossing to me,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.620
so I can get past any blocker.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.080
All the blockers vanish from sight...

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.670
and the view of the other side 
of the net opens up.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.080
The other side of the net...

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.840
Don't mind.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.920
One more.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.880
68th Prefecture Sporting Competition
  Volleyball Tournament

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.880
Karasuno Gymnasium
Indoor Sports Arena

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.840
Idate Ind                Karasuno

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.640
It's a feint. In front!

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.010
Nice, Noya-san.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:34.600
Asahi.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.190
Iron Wall of Idate 
<font size="12">Idate Industrial High School Volleyball Club supporters association</c>

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.400
Damn.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.970
He missed, but still, that libero is amazing.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.610
I'm sorry. I'll get the next one.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.340
Yeah. His skills are amazingly high-level.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.130
But the offense is weak...

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.230
Blocked again...

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.540
I've lost count of how many
 they've blocked.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.730
I kept calling for a toss.
 "Bring it to me."

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.100
"I will score."

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.500
But I've reached the very end.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.960
I'm scared to call for a toss.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.670
Asahi-san?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.630
Asahi?

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.180
Suga, to the right.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.090
Da-Daichi!

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.970
Idate Ind                Karasuno

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.050
Damn it!

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.710
I couldn't follow on any of the blocks.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.660
Dashing
Full Force

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.660
Why? Why aren't you berating me?

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.200
We lost because of me.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.020
No matter how much you followed,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.580
if I can't spike and score, it's all for nothing!

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.580
Asahi.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.590
What do you mean "it's all for nothing"?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.620
Then why didn't you call 
for a toss at the end?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.140
You were in a position to spike.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.120
Stop it, Nishinoya.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.370
I was only bringing the ball to Asahi. 
He must've been tired.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.720
Toss to me all you want.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.600
I'll never score.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.730
You don't know that 'til you spike.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.500
Maybe the next one will score!

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.570
I kept the ball in the air.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:16.160
It's not your place to give up.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.310
Noya!

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.400
I'm a libero. I'm essential to defense.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.880
I'm the cornerstone of the team!

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.530
But...

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.270
I'm not the one who can score points.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.650
I can't attack.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.900
I don't care if your spikes don't score.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.180
I would never berate you in the least.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.390
But I won't stand for you 
giving up so selfishly.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.650
A-Asahi-san.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.560
Asahi.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.990
Wait, Asahi.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.410
Why didn't you show up at club yesterday?

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:08.380
Soon after New Year,
 it'll be the Inter-High.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.260
It's no fun hitting spikes that don't score.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.920
What am I saying?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.090
I don't think that at all.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.560
You, too. You save the ball, 
but if no one scores,

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.760
it's all in vain.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.090
Stop it.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.560
Nishinoya isn't a guy that thinks like that.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.880
Suga felt responsible every 
time my ball got blocked—

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.860
Who cares about the other guys?

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.030
Hey, who's shouting?

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.530
Don't make noise in the hall.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.200
Asahi-san.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.730
Hey.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:39.990
Shut up!

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.750
How dare you!

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.270
He did that in front of the dean.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.460
Don't you want to spike and score again?

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.300
Nice, Hinata.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.860
Thanks!

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.260
Hinata, you serve next.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:04.930
That's what I want.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.480
No matter how many times I fail,

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.940
I still want to spike.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.710
Then, I'm fine.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.910
Now that you said that, I'm fine.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.000
My job is to keep the ball in play.
 That's all.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.780
Hinata, nice serve!

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.510
Net in!

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.690
Whoops.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.210
Sorry! Cover for me.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.790
Long-hair guy, you do last.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.240
The sky is the domain of spikers.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.770
I can't do battle up there...

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.950
Let's block 'em.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.560
Don't give orders.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.440
Asahi-san, I'm blocking you for real.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.900
If I keep the ball in play... 
as long it stays connected...

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.120
I want to spike again.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.830
I know the ace will score for us.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.260
He saved it.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.800
Nice follow.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.020
Mainly block-follow.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.480
Training in saving balls that get blocked.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.230
Noya-san...

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.670
Even if the ball bounces off the wall...

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.420
I'll keep it in play.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.070
So call for a toss again,

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.640
ace!

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.290
Cover.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:46.990
All right.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.600
What should I do?
 Who do I toss it to?

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.460
The left is open.
 That might be the best, but...

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.170
If I toss to Asahi and 
he gets blocked again...

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:58.550
Sugawara-san.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.340
Give it to him

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.800
'til he scores.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.480
You're a total sadist, King.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.390
What?

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.820
When the going gets rough, 
when the receive is tenuous,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.100
the last ball is entrusted to the ace.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.810
I know. I know it,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.240
but Asahi isn't waiting for a toss,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.060
and I'm putting him on the 
spot against three blockers.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.200
The spike...

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.700
I can spike because the toss goes up.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.760
Let me toss to you again, Asahi.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.590
The toss goes up because 
of the connecting receive.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.130
I kept the ball in the air.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.640
It's not your place to give up.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.630
I'm not the only one who spikes.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.560
Everybody plays his own respective part.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.440
And yet, I...

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.260
You don't win alone. 
That's just how it is.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.500
That's why everyone calls 
you an ace, Asahi-san.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.390
If you still like volleyball...

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.490
Call for a toss again,

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.660
ace!

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.000
All right.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:16.750
Shimada-san－

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.720
Suga!

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.060
One more!

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.260
Ah,

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.470
the ace awaits.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.100
He's calling for a toss.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.500
A high toss, slightly away from the net.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:45.070
The toss, Asahi's speciality, 
which I've tossed to him many times.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.030
Even if it's just a plain toss, 
give it all you got... carefully...

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.160
You're rooting for the 
other team, aren't you?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.710
Well, sorry to say it,
 but I'm blocking them.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.790
Of course. What's the point of holding back?

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.630
The dependable guardian behind me...

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.890
The easy-to-spike tosses he sends me...

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.050
I lack for nothing.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.660
I had forgotten such simple,
 obvious things...

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:16.520
I'm...

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.120
...not fighting this battle alone.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.610
To strike past all obstacles...

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.420
That's the ace.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:15.140
Next Episode Preview

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.510
Tanaka-senpai, stop crying 
and block properly.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:20.620
Jackass, I'm not crying! This is...

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.940
Sweat? Oh, sure, that's what that is.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.610
My nose is running!

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.940
