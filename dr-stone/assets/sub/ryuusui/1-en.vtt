00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Kingdom of Science Drama Club First Performance
"The Mysterious Light"

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.530
Why did he want us all here?

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.150
Performance?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.860
"Mysterious Light"?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.020
One day, thousands of years ago...

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.820
The planet was engulfed 
in a mysterious light.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.260
Oh, shit!

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.460
This is really bad!

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.100
And so all of humanity was turned to stone.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.100
Every last piece of civilization that 
had been built up until then collapsed.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.160
But there was one man who refused to give up,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.530
and prepared himself for his own reawakening.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.620
That man was...

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.820
A boy of science, Ishigami Senku.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.780
One, two, three,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.270
four, five, six, seven, eight...

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.270
Senku held on to his consciousness, 
continuing to count for thousands of years.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.230
Crackle, crackle, crackle!

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.440
Hm?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.940
What's this?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.070
The whole world's stone, damn it!

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.420
All right, I'm going to climb right back

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.330
to the top of humanity's 
two-million-year tech tree!

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.540
And we're going to use science to figure 
out how to undo the petrification.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.480
Time to build civilization up from scratch!

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.760
Senku and Taiju continue their research.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.140
The revival fluid works! 
We can un-petrify people!

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.100
And after a fierce battle 
with the Tsukasa Empire,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.900
the time has finally come 
to tackle <i>the</i> mystery.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.970
Yeah.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.060
To solve the mystery, we're headed 
to the other side of the planet,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.040
where the petrification beam came from!

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.030
What?!

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.640
Th-The other side of the planet, you say?!

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.160
But h-how do we do that?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.510
We're all going to build a ship together!

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.090
This is exhilarating!

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.090
Senku...

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.230
He might be able to do it.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.590
He might even solve the 
mystery behind the light.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.020
Heya!

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.740
If you've been totally confused this 
whole time, you're one of us now.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.320
So can we count on you to help out?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.030
Yeah!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.200
Time to take back civilization!

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.290
We got this!

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.170
He's raising morale by sharing information.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.980
That's our Gen.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.640
Stage plays!

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.930
I love it.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.500
That was powerful.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.110
Well then, everyone, since we're 
all building our ship together,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.010
it's time to start pitting our 
ideas against each other's!

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.650
Damn it, Gen...

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.120
This confetti is ten billion 
percent way too extra.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.350
Don't say that, Senku-chan.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.740
We're trying to set a mood here.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.950
Magma and Yo?

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.040
I wasn't expecting those two, either.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.080
They always look like slobs, 
but they look really smart today!

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.190
The people of Ishigami Village 
are people of the sea.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.350
Ships are right in our wheelhouse.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.100
The throne is mine now!

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.780
This is finally my chance!

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.060
Once I win here, I'll be right at the top.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.230
All right, let's have the three 
of you present your ideas!

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.030
Why do we even need a competition, anyway?

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.660
Senku's obviously going to win.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.590
Yeah, it's strange.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.700
Especially since he must want 
to leave as soon as we can.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.370
Huh? Yo-chan?

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.210
You'll want to see my presentation last.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.250
My ship's already finished, after all.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.950
Seeing is believing, right?

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.790
Whoever can build the thing and 
show it off first is going to win.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.840
You primitives aren't going to have much...

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.080
Nah. I shouldn't be laughing 
at the underdeveloped.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.700
Awesome!

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.480
The village is full of boats.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.240
I've seen way too many of them.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.870
This gets me pumped to see Yo's ship, too!

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.740
You did say "seeing is believing," didn't you?

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.530
With that smug look on your face.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.850
You sure did.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.390
Hurry up and show us!

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.670
I never said such a thing.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.500
Wait, did I?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.530
Oh, crap!

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.520
I left it at home!

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.680
Hey, it's like a tiny raft thing.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.330
Senku-chan, what's up?

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.070
Are the sails made of straw?

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.260
Made of what, now?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.790
Is it sewn from straw?

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.290
Yeah, something like that, I guess.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.980
This is insanely useful, Magma.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.460
You're right.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.670
You really are people of the sea.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.460
Experience is worth its weight in gold.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.430
If we know that straw 
sails are good enough...

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.300
We can definitely start building this ship.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.440
That's it!

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.630
Damn it!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.320
He went all-out!

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.480
That's obviously what we want, 
if we can build it!

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.740
It's a proper sailboat.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.250
It looks cool as hell, but how many hundreds 
of years are we going to spend on it?

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.320
I'll die of old age before it's done!

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.750
Don't do this to me!

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.750
Unless we had, like, a hundred 
people to help build it...

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.610
Wake up, all of you.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.570
What do you think that 
stupid stage play was for?

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.010
We've got all those strapping men on our 
side that Tsukasa-sensei woke up for us.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.190
We have a hybrid of science 
and strength in our manpower.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.300
This is going to be exhilarating!

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.810
Getting to the other side of the planet

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.220
should be easy on a ship like this one, right?

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.580
Yeah, as long as we can get access

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.100
to one more special talent. 
We're ten billion percent going to need it.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.880
Tsuka-san...

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.240
Buck up already.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.690
Huh?

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.870
Tsukasa told me about you.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.950
You're the information broker 
who knew who to revive?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.790
I have a job for you, journalist.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.050
Journalist...

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.310
Human contact...

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.410
Information about people...

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.530
Those were my weapons as a journalist.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.570
Who do you want?

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.550
I'll find whoever it is you're after.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.730
I want a captain.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.060
This'll be a make-or-break Age of Discovery 
voyage across the planet.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.400
We need a captain with 
ten billion skill points in sailing.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.700
They'll be the key to reviving all of humanity.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.420
That's who we need on our team.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.070
I see it.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.250
That's the island.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.500
Wait for us, Captain!

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.920
Although...

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.020
We're making a sailboat.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:58.010
Modern Ships

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:58.010
Sailboats

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:58.010
Wind-powered

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.780
Are we sure we can find someone 
who has that kind of experience?

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.010
A modern person, I mean.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.170
Probably only for training purposes.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.190
I don't think we'd find anyone anywhere in 
the world who's been sailing all the time.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.280
Ryusu—

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.320
Ryusu?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.110
No, never mind!

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.180
Let's go! Hurry!

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.740
Nanami Academy.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:28.030
Nautical schools like this 
one usually teach sailing.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.120
One of the teachers would probably 
know how to steer one, at least.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.240
All right, time to mine stone statues.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.130
Dig, dig, and dig some more, Team Gorillas!

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.190
We'll take care of it!

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.180
I'm not a gorilla, m'kay?

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.230
Are we waking up all of them?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.320
No. We're running out of revival fluid,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.720
thanks to Homura wrecking the miracle cave.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.700
Guess we'll have to choose a good 
middle-ground with plenty of experience, then.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.630
I know a few of the instructors 
from when I came to do a report.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.520
There he is.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.510
Ryusui...

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.010
You said that name before, too.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.250
No, no!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.680
You really don't want him!

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.190
Quit mumbling and just speak.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.390
He's got talent, right?

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.690
That must be why you blurted out his name.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.910
Nanami Academy was owned by the king of 
maritime trade, the Nanami Conglomerate.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.550
They had 200 trillion yen in assets.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.460
And he's the hopelessly self-indulgent 
son of the Nanami family.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.860
Nanami Ryusui.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.740
He'd apparently been spending his 
hundreds of millions of yen in allowance

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.120
to collect model ships and bottle 
ships since he was a kid.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.340
H-Hundreds of millions in <i>allowance</i>?!

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.810
He could never get enough, so eventually, 
he had a real sailboat built for him.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.530
Ever since he was in middle school,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.650
he'd been sailing around the world 
seeking pleasure, without any help.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.530
A captain since middle school?!

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.060
He's the real deal!

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.610
Nothing's more valuable than experience.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.060
Didn't I tell you he's 
hopelessly self-indulgent?

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.560
Tsukasa hated him for being 
an established power, too.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.990
I would choose someone else.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.100
We won't find anyone who's a more 
skilled sailor than Ryusui-kun,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.250
but we won't find anyone who's got a 
personality worse than his, either.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.860
The ultimate dilemma...

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.090
Do we take a proper, 
reasonably talented person,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.010
or do we take the risky one 
with top-of-the-line skill?

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.350
He's already using the revival fluid on him!

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:50.310
Talent comes first, obviously.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.250
I'm back at last!

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.400
The world is mine once again!

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.650
Ryusui

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.430
I've returned!

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.810
I want everything in the world!

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.350
And the whole world wanted me, too!

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.470
Minami...

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.520
I think I already understand what you meant.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.330
I told you so!

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.690
Are you the ones who saved me?

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.170
I'll have to thank you, then, the best I can.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.950
Ask my butler, Francois, for a check.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.340
Write any number you like on it, 
whether it's ten billion or twenty billion.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.420
Francois!

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.730
Looks like we're well beyond that.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.760
You can always trust a sailor's instincts.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.910
Civilization has collapsed.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.810
The Nanami Conglomerate and I 
have lost all of our assets.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.120
Correct?

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.010
Yeah, that's right.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.900
I'm glad you're quick to catch on.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.250
This is an amazing opportunity!

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.760
Many thanks for waking me up!

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.490
With all of the world's ownership rights 
erased, I can have everything to myself!

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.940
Why don't you start by 
acquiring some clothes?

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.750
Sorry about that.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.310
Pardon my indecency in the presence 
of three beautiful women.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.370
Three beautiful women?

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.790
Are you so groggy that you 
can't even count straight?

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.840
You mean two?

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.320
You don't need to keep saying 
the truth all the time.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.100
What are you talking about?

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.710
There may be many types, 
but all women are beautiful.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:43.970
Am I wrong?

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.340
This is impressive, everyone.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.620
I want this!

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.310
I can't wait to see the sailboat, can you?

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.540
Will this ship take us to the 
other side of the planet?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.290
Nah, no way this is going to work, right?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.100
Not with the sailing technique of a 
captain who's used to modern ships.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.540
This primitive ship's going to 
take way more skill, isn't it?

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.890
Before I answer that question, 
you should retreat and protect the ship.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.230
You can always trust a sailor's instincts.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.270
The temperature's risen quickly.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:21.770
It's 14 degrees.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.020
He's right.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.460
It's exactly 14 degrees.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:29.950
Humidity is up to 90%.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.500
The wind's coming from the south-southwest.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.810
The Siberian air mass is 
likely being driven upward

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.800
by the influence of the 
Yangtze River air mass.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.910
Capillatus clouds are approaching at 
approximately 60 kilometers per hour.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.810
That means...

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.310
The spring rain is coming.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.710
The May storms!

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.570
He was dead-on.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.140
Thank goodness.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.920
What is the deal with that Ryusui man?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.780
Was that science, too?

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.940
We'd be screwed if we were hit 
by such a storm on the open sea.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.590
The lumber isn't tough enough.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.860
It's nothing like the timber that humans 
spent decades carefully culling.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.240
Traveling across the world with 
these sails is too much of a gamble.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.090
I figured.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.390
We'll make a motor-sail hybrid ship.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.580
We will?

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:23.370
Senku...

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.710
You were testing me, weren't you?

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.920
To see if I'd be quick to say yes,
even if it was a stupid idea.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:29.890
You cheeky bastard.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.400
I would have wanted you in 
the Nanami Conglomerate.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.500
Where are we getting power?

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.250
The low-quality coal you're 
using for your furnaces?

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.350
That garbage will sink the 
ship with its weight alone.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:46.440
We won't make it to the other side 
of the planet without proper fuel.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.100
What does that mean?

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.070
I suck at science. I'm so lost.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.380
Don't play coy with me!

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.930
You know what I want,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.370
don't you, Senku?

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.940
Very well.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.810
That's what the Kingdom of Science wants, too.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.060
Let's go get us some of the good stuff.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.820
We're going to dig up the king of fuels.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.860
We're drilling for oil!

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.300
Where in Japan are we 
going to find any?! How?!

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.970
This isn't going to work!

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.620
You'd be surprised.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:30.580
Sh-Shizuoka?!

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.720
Seriously?!

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.500
Yeah, I'm serious.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.710
It's called the Sagara Oil Field.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.780
They stopped drilling there for 
profitability reasons, but it's still active.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.360
We'll find some world-class oil there.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.530
It's a treasure trove.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.840
Japan's got some crazy resources, huh?

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.670
Just that there isn't much of them.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.690
I'm not sure I get it, 
but you can count on me!

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.690
Yeah, you're up, resource king.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:04.850
Here we go, New Chrome Expedition Team!

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600


00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.600
Best Eyes

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.580


00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.580
Best Ears

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.970
The best expedition team in the world

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.570
will be back with this king-of-fuel 
stuff called "oil"!

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.530
Once we have some oil,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:27.220
I'll take you all to the other side 
of the planet with my sailing prowess.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.750
But on one condition.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.460
I'm putting my life on the line 
to protect everyone else's.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.720
As the captain, I demand the rights 
to the oil field that we discover.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.440
Jeez!

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.260
That's way too unscrupulous!

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.130
How indecent of you to put 
such a small price on life.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.390
If you think it's too much, 
go ask someone else.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:53.210
You're the only one who has the skills.

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.150
You're gouging us because you know that.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.010
Wait, but even if we find the oil field, 
if Ryusui-chan takes all of it,

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.680
what will we use as fuel for our ship?

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.360
What are you talking about?

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.870
Don't be silly.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.260
You lot are going to be 
buying the oil from me.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.560
Compensation

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.560
Reward

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:22.820
Currency
acquired!!

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.910
What the hell?!

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.020
I'm so jealous!

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.480
He's only been awake for a few moments, 
and he's already mega-rich.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.420
How the hell?!

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.570
All right.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.630
Yo! 'Sup?

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.410
Ryusui, was it?

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.680
I'm envious...

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.620
Er, jealous...

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.160
Er, suspicious of you.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.260
Can I join...

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.100
I mean...

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.790
As a former cop, I think I should 
let you know how it's done.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.550
The currency issued by the 
Ryusui Conglomerate is the drago.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.820
I'll sell you one milliliter of 
oil for this 100 drago bill.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.610
As soon as we find it.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.780
Huh?

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.670
I don't need oil, dude.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.370
Where can I even use this money?

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.990
Look at that.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.750 line:20%
Ramen

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.440
Ramen, please!

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.870 line:20%
Cotton candy

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:24.100
Senku and his buddies need 
to collect drago to buy oil.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:27.710
To that end, they're going to use 
science to sell all kinds of stuff.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.120
Am I wrong?

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.570
It's become a legitimate 
currency already, huh?

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.680
Do you still not want any?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.770
I do!

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.750
I want it!

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.300
Thank you!

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.980
I told you he had personality issues.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.020
Are you sure you want to 
let him carry on like that?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.290
I don't mind. For now.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.150
Currency is as much a fruit 
of science as anything.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.270
It brings people's strengths together.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:05.280
He's gone ahead and made it for us, 
so let's put it to good use.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.760
Right when they're flush with cash!

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.590
Well done, Nikki.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.560
I want your strength!

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.330
Ryusui...

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.530
You're new here, so I don't 
mind giving you a hand.

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.970
But I'm not taking this play money.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.700
We don't even have any oil, do we?

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.770
What value do these scraps have?

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.620
Excellent question.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.420
The value of currency is there, 
whether there's anything backing it or not.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:47.990
It's trust.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:50.550
Senku...

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:56.120
If he's really brought all this 
science into this stone world,

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.000
he'll surely find the oil fields.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.230
And that very expectation 
turns paper into treasure!

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.070
What is it?

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.020
I hear a waterfall.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:11.970
What?

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.320
There it is.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.490
Oh, shit...

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.150
It's way off from Senku's map.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.170
Did he write it out wrong?

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.610
No.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.290
I don't remember the geography either,

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:43.000
but this couldn't have 
been here 3,700 years ago.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.220
It's like...

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:49.510
Niagara Falls.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.800
See the tallest mountain over there?

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.960
The west side of it looks treacherous.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:05.210
We may have underestimated...

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.890
how long 3,700 years really is.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.510
Oh, yeah?

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.680
The coastline was a mess, too.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.120
So is the interior.

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.040
What's wrong, Senku-chan?

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.070
What was I expecting?

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.550
The science users would 
be disappointed in me.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.780
The cycle is just a few centuries.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:46.560
Just one eruption of Mount Fuji 
is enough to change the landscape.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.830
In the 3,700 years that we were asleep,

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:55.450
it must have gone off at least four or 
five times, potentially more than ten.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:25:00.080
Our modern maps aren't worth shit.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.580
That's so scary!

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.710
We'll need a new map.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.290
Gotta start working on it now.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.420
We'll figure it out without a map.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.260
No...

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.720
It'd be too much of a long shot to find 
an oil field without any directions,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.720
and too dangerous.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.130
A map...

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.810
But how?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.080
Birds...

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.670
If only we could ride a 
bird to get a look around.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:37.690
I bet they know all about what the 
ground looks like from way up there.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.860
That's it!

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.020
Hemp!

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.840
I want hemp!

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.820
We'll need to mobilize en masse 
to gather a stupid amount of hemp.

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:50.580
You know, though, Senku-chan...

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.460
Everyone's got their hands 
full building the ship.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.590
This is how we connect oil with currency.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.120
We'll make them spend all 
the drago they've saved up.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.890
I might be filthy rich.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.070
I've got twice as much drago as you!

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.070
Haven't you heard?

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.930
Your drago is in grave danger.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:20.700
What?

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.480
We can't find that oil field.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.810
If we don't find the oil, the deal to 
swap oil for drago goes "poof," right?

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:33.360
So...

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.970
I'll teach you how to make sure your 
precious drago doesn't turn into scrap paper!

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:51.190
Those guys are totally at the mercy of money.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.510
All it takes is one rumor 
to crash a currency.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.610
It's been that way for thousands of years.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.720
After all the effort they 
put into making money,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.810
you're manipulating the currency 
to make them do your bidding.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.250
You lot are way more insidious than I am.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.100
Look at all the hemp we collected, Senku!

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.710
Suika was right.

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.880
We should have searched for 
the oil field from above.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.960
Hot-air balloons.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.360
The treasure hunters of science...

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.950
search from above!

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.200
Humans?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.350
Flying?

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.000
In the sky?!

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.710
We're going to take on the world.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.780
Let's conquer this new Japan 
that Mount Fuji has made for us.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.030
Don't make me laugh, Senku!

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.100
That's too much, even for you.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.580
There's no way humans can fly.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.260
Nah. I shouldn't be laughing 
at the underdeveloped.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.230
Don't worry, I won't laugh.
I don't get it, either.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.860
How the hell are we going to fly 
when we've got nothing to fly with?

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.940
This is getting even better!

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.910
The sky?

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.100
I want it!

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.530
Done.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:12.330
This is our road map to flying the skies.

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.140
This is going to be the longest road map yet!

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.880
But obviously I'm excited!

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.740
Hemp threads

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.720
Cloth

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.680
Balloon

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.990
So short!

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.660
You'd be shocked at how 
easy hot-air balloons are.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.600
You can fold up a whole flight 
kit and throw it in your trunk.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.250
I never knew flying would 
be such a casual activity.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:38.800
Hemp cloth?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.920
Isn't that going to leak air?

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.360
A little bit of leaking won't hurt.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.890
The first balloon that humanity took 
flight in was made of hemp cloth.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.440
The one massive ordeal to overcome is...

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.020
Right...

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.860
You need a crap ton of cloth, don't you?

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.330
Oh, look!

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.500
I totally didn't realize!

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.260
We've got the crafts club here!

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.540
The science team will commit itself 
to designing the passenger basket.

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.010
We'll make any tools you need.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.790
Can I leave the cloth-making to you?

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.520
To the Yuzuriha Crafts Team?

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.820
Of course you can.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.820
I'll take care of crushing the hemp.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.540
I don't get it.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.170
Are we really going to fly 
with this grass stuff?

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:38.300
You can't fly with <i>grass</i>.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.040
We're making thread out of it.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:48.010
We're making the thread using a spinner.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.200
Spinner?

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.580
Episode 1!

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.560
Episode 1

00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.460
We take these scraggly-looking hairs from 
when you extract the fiber from the hemp,

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.850
gather a bunch, tie it to a spinner,

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:09.790
twist it around a little, 
and then just spin it.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.350
There, done!

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.600
See? Easy, right?

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.970
It's actually kinda fun.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.410
And we're going to make...

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.660
A few dozens of thousands 
of kilometers' worth.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.960
Here we go again! I knew it!

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.420
It's never going to end!

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.840
Just do it, and it will end.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.580
I'm even more confused.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.090
This string is going to let us fly?

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.070
No, man.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.650
You can't fly with string.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.850
We're making cloth out of it.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.730
Okay, next, let's go over how to make cloth.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.650

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.650
Episode 2

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.650
Episode 2!

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:50.320
First, string the hemp on 
vertically, like a harp.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.290
Then, do it horizontally.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.980
Up, down, up, down, tucking 
them in one after the other.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.300
Do that over and over, and...

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.000
It starts looking like cloth!

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.410
Are we really going to build up 
the cloth one string at a time?!

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.700
Th-This is going to take way too long.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.090
Handcrafts take patience.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.730
How the hell is this "easy"?!

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:19.350
It's a lot of work, but it's easy work.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.600
That said, this really would take forever.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.180
Should we ask the science team for help?

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.170
A loom, huh?

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.900
Finally...

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.260
A loom!

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.580
Hey, it's done.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.710
Was this not what you were 
expecting, Yuzuriha-chan?

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.220
We didn't have much time.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.550
Did you want an electric one?

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.140
N-N-N-N-No, that's not it!

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.500
I appreciate it! A lot!

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:12.050
What do you say we dye it with this?

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.900
We may as well.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.340
You're really ladylike, huh?

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.220
It's so nice!

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.510
Cloth acquired!!

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.470
Good going, crafts team.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.470
We're almost there, huh?

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.210
We messed up some of them, though.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:49.390
There might be a few that 
are too thin to hold air.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.810
Keep at it a bit longer, then.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.450
Did you guys hear?

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.590
We don't have enough thread.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:05.540
With that, it's time for our happy 
thread-spinning competition!

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:11.880
Whoever makes the longest thread 
wins a whopping 10,000 drago!

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:15.860
My ass, Gen.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.650
I mean, that'll get them pumped, but...

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.640
Where do we find such a war chest?

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.420
Dude.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.730
Don't worry, we'll make all of it back!

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:34.970
I mean, you know, why don't we make a 
product to sell with the botched cloth?

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.140
Sell it where?

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.900
The Senku Department Store.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.350
So that's the deal...

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.840
I'll make it!

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.330
I'd love to!

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.320
Hard at Work
Keep Out

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.320
It's really noisy in there.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.290
Yuzuriha-chan, are you—

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.200
Hey, Kinro!

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.260
She's gone berserk.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.540
That's not the Yuzuriha-chan we know, is it?

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.780
You think so?

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.690
She's always like that when 
she's working on her crafts.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.980
Th-This is so embarrassing...

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.880
Skirt

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:34.880

Total

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:35.510
If you're going for an ethnic vibe, 
match it with a stole for an elegant look.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.600
Kinro?!

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.830
You're swinging the wrong arm!

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:47.460
Pants

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:47.460
Belt

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.580
Show off some grown-up confidence 
with a knit turtleneck

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.430
and some accessories for a classic fit.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.370
All this is made with just hemp?!

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.270
That's insane!

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:57.590

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:57.590

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.570
A girly look with a dash of street 
fashion for a contemporary look.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.540
It's so cute!

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.570
I kinda want that...

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.900
Studded Bracelet

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:11.030
A three-piece suit for that special 
occasion, with some rock 'n roll spice.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:14.360
Tailored Jacket

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:14.360
Vest

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:14.360
Necktie

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:14.360
Shirt

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.360
Total

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.610
It's so expensive!

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.360
Go ahead, fall in love with me.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.670
Check it out!

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.520
You look fantastic, Magma-sama!

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.490
It's pretty, but the price...

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.790
I think I'm going to go for it.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:32.520
You're buying it?

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.890
Actually, I'm going to think it over.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.230
They're the Senku Department 
Store's first high-end products.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.530
It might be a while before 
they start selling.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.410
Hand them out to anyone who works.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.530
We have a living manifestation of 
greed who'll buy just about anything.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.250
Thank you for shopping.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.030
Wait, this is only hurting <i>me</i>, isn't it?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.760
Huge war chest
acquired!!

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:13.820
That's it for our biggest hurdle...

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.440
a crap ton of cloth.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.860
Let's get this thing built and into the sky.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:26.990
What?! A flying machine?!

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.780
Holy crap!

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.720
Wait, Chrome!

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.830
We're flying! Holy shit!

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.930
Senku-kun, how big do we need to make it?

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.610
Let me think...

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:44.940
If the balloon is 2,000 square meters and 
we heat 15-degree air up to 90 degrees,

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:51.380
Atmospheric Density

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:47.210
we get 520 kilograms of lift.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.170
Air temperature drops 6.5 
degrees every thousand meters.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.280
Even if we keep it under 100 degrees 
to avoid igniting the thin cloth,

00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.130
we can make it to peak altitude just 
below the jet stream, 1,500 meters up.

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.590
Which means...

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.850
The balloon needs to be 7.8 meters 
in diameter for a maximum capacity

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.430
of three people.

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.880
Ow!

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.280
I poked myself again!

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.770
Whee, whee, whee!

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.100
Those primitives are all so good...

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.630
We all got lots of practice sewing 
leather clothes and stuff.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.340
You modern people are so useless.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.890
You aren't even doing anything. 
Why are you being so smug?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.690
Yo, what was that about 
modern people being useless?

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.260
And why are you being so smug?

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.610
It's finally done!

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.920
This is the flying machine?

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.740
It's so damn huge!

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.120
So who's getting in?

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.010
Up to three of us, right?

00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:59.400
I don't want to be one of them.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.570
Senku knows how it works, so he's a given.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.410
Who are the other two?

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:06.700
The balloon won't fly itself.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:09.830
We need to read the wind to maneuver it.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.270
Which means we need a professional 
of the wind to pilot it.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:14.350
Got it!

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.890
Hey, Ryu—

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.540
Shh!

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.120
Your negotiation tactics are way too 
straightforward, Senku-chan, Taiju-chan!

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.130
Ryusui-chan's going to rip us off again.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.400
I'll let you deal with all that noise.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.990
Okay, gather round, everyone!

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.010
We need two more people to man the balloon.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.730
We'll choose them by lottery.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:42.040
The two Jokers in this deck 
are the winning cards.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.990
Here you go, Ryusui-chan, you're up next.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.620
He's going to pretend Ryusui-kun 
winning was a coincidence...

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.360
...and make him work for free.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.770
Is he actually going to buy it?

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.480
I see what you did there.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.770
If you want my help, you should just ask.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.500
Gen, in acknowledgment of your clever trick,

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.020
I'll fly for you for a mere million drago.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.730
The Joker and the win are mine!

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.250
There's an experiment that 
shows that, more than anything,

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.510
people want what they thought 
they had gotten, but lost.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.220
That's exactly how it is with dating.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.620
Oh, no, who could have seen this coming?

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.790
I ended up with the Joker.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.230
What to do?

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.860
What, you don't want it?

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.130
You'll never get a platinum 
ticket like that again.

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.280
One of the first humans to 
take flight in the new world!

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.710
I know...

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.870
I'm a little afraid of flying 
in a balloon, though...

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.830
I wouldn't mind going instead, then!

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.690
Really?!

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:06.230
But...

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.820
I <i>did</i> win this ticket...

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.850
I don't think I should just give it away.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.710
We were supposed to pay <i>him</i>...

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.890
How did we even get here?!

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.910
I'm terrified of Gen-kun.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.420
We're going to have our oil funds in no time.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.840
All right, I'll win the next one.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.070
Damn, missed.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.910
We can choose the last one at random, right?

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:34.910
Yeah.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.490
Anyone who's interested and who 
won't freak out mid-flight.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.450
I'm interested!

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.020
Way too interested!

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.520
I-I'm drawing a card.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.460
If it's a lottery for a chance 
to get in the flying machine...

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.800
I'm gonna draw the winning 
card with sheer willpower!

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.980
Chrome...

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.870
Did you run all the way back?

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.980
I want to see with my own 
eyes, from the sky,

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.330
what the world is really like.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.420
Senku told me...

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.840
that the world is round.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.230
But for those of us who've lived our 
entire lives in this tiny village...

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.180
We have to take your word for it.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:20.250
We only know because you already do, Senku.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.270
So please...

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:39.030
Yes!

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.570
Seriously?

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.890
Chrome actually drew the right 
card with sheer willpower!

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:46.240
All right!

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.320
Senku-chan, what's up?

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.830
It's a pilot balloon that 
uses hydrogen and deer gut.

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:02.540
Rate of ascent?

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.230
At that size, roughly 70 meters per minute.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.770
Does that tell you something?

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.860
It'll show us all the winds above us.

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.200
We can fly in this wind!

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.630
It's a perfect day for a launch!

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:26.100
W-We're floating!

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.560
They're actually flying!

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.690
We pulled it off!

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.770
People are so amazing.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.360
We're so greedy and relentless.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.660
We make things.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.190
With millions of years of science.

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:55.960
They're so tiny already.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.570
Huh?

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.550
The balloon's glimmering.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.740
It's still pitch dark for 
the people on the ground.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.320
We're 1,200 meters up.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.790
We're experiencing dawn seven 
minutes earlier than the ground.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:31.080
The world really is round.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.130
I saw it.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.400
With my own eyes...

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.660
Crap.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.350
I want to see more.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.130
I want to know everything about the world!

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.490
We're in the sky, protected by 
nothing but our own skin and flesh.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:51.250
You don't get this kind of 
extravagance anywhere else.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.730
Not this unique sensation.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:43:59.660
We're with the birds!

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.140
We shouldn't be happy about that.

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.130
Bird strikes.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.150
They're a ridiculously 
common kind of accident.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:13.250
Really?

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.930
We just need to dodge them.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.290
It's odd, though...

00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:21.380
We aren't rising as fast as I expected.

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.560
It's up to the wind whether 
or not a balloon can ascend.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.130
It's literally a sailboat of the sky.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:33.270
Which means it's my time to take 
this maiden flight to the goal!

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.150
Goal?

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:38.080
Where is this balloon headed, anyway?

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.110
Ishigami Village.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.810
What?!

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.110
That's a two-day walk if you book it!

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.180
And about two hours by balloon.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.410
That's the power of the wind.

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:54.090
After all we went through 
to travel that distance...

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.350
Sky travel is insane.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.930
It's so easy.

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.670
It's actually not that easy.

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.350
Flying west to Ishigami Village 
is a bit complicated.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:11.160
There's a wind blowing eastward 
all the time above Japan.

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:12.500
Yeah.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.960
Any amateur can fly east.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:19.130
So how are we flying west, then?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.590
A low pressure system!

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.780
It's usually a pest of a 
wind that brews storms.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:28.920
We're taking advantage of that 
low pressure system's rotation,

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.520
capturing it to travel west.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:36.470
With the skills to fly to 
Ishigami Village on this wind,

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:41.280
we'll know that we can go even 
further, to hunt for oil.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:43.590
It's difficult and dangerous.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:47.550
But a professional adventurer overcomes.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:48.890
Am I wrong?

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:53.560
With me as your captain, 
you amateurs are free to relax.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.220
A professional adventurer?

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.290
Did you just call me an </i>amateur<i>?

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.090
Me? The king of exploration?

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:08.280
I'm sure you're a pro when it 
comes to adventuring the seas.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.850
But when it comes to exploring the land,

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.620
I'd say you're still green.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:20.650
When you're close to the ground, 
the wind tends to blow along the rivers.

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:24.860
You're right, we're being 
drawn along the river a bit.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.270
We'll be stranded if it takes us out to sea.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:29.430
Let's climb higher.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:34.750
A true professional adventurer who 
explores on their own two feet

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.460
would know this kind of crap by heart.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.490
I'm in a different league from the 
amateurs who take vehicles everywhere!

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.860
Enough of your stupid chest-thumping.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:53.850
If you want to see what the wind's like 
below you, you just need one of these things.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.890
That's quite the dramatic change.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.780
To fly westward is to battle 
with the gods of the sky.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.530
I-It's huge...

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:13.590
The bearer of storms, demon of the clouds...

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.580
The cumulonimbus!

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.870
H-H-Holy crap!

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:30.850
What is this?!

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:35.010
Any closer, and it'll pull us 
in with overwhelming force.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:36.550
A balloon wouldn't stand a chance.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.060
We're preparing to land immediately!

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.870
Pull the string, Chrome!

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.100
That'll open the top of the 
balloon and release hot air,

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.230
allowing us to descend quickly.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.110
Got it!

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:47.970
Wait!

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.250
Senku?

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.090
It's already open.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.630
If you pull it and the 
cloth tears, we'll crash.

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:56.620
How?!

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.290
It was that bird strike.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.630
No wonder we couldn't ascend.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.920
Crap!

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.660
We're going higher even though 
we've already shut off the flame!

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.240
We've been captured by the updraft 
of the cloud demon cumulonimbus!

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.890
Isn't there any way to descend?!

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:28.970
Nope.

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.030
We have no escape route.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:40.610
Put your brain in overdrive...

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.170
Think of something!

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.310
What kind of ammo can science offer?

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.840
We're out of time once the steep ascent puts 
me into anoxia and my brain shuts down.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.750
This is the greatest opportunity!

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.410
I'll obtain the skills to 
take on the cloud demon.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.700
I'll find a way out of this!

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.060
A hole in the wind!

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.850
Damn it...

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:04.230
I want to get out!

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.810
There's no way out.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:07.620
Get out?

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.350
Is that it?

00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:11.340
Is that really the answer?

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:15.400
Humans are weak as hell.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:18.160
Bear

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.140
Human

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.790
Running away from nature can 
only ever get us killed.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:21.930
Don't run...

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.700
We're just going to bust our 
way through with mind and soul!

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.650
Right through the cloud demon!

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:36.420
Bad idea?

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:37.490
No.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:43.540
If we jet our way a few thousand meters up,

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:47.890
we'll be even higher than this ginormous, 
ever-growing Mister Cumulonimbus.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.070
It's an insane altitude, but we'll 
just barely avoid suffocating.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:56.550
Not bad, Chrome...

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.830
In that case, throw in all 
the fuel we have left.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.000
Okay.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.200
We're accelerating as fast as we can

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.120
to blow right through the 
cumulonimbus, aren't we?

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.210
Isn't that...

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.340
The revival fluid that brought 
me back from petrification?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.430
It's a mix of alcohol and nitric acid.

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.570
It burns like crazy.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:19.570
That's our last bottle.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.990
It's a bit of a waste, but...

00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:23.200
You'll be freaked out...

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.410
by the energy density of liquid fuels!

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:43.540
Yes!

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.620
Let's go!

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.850
Where is it?

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.880
Where's the exit?

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.020
Ryusui, what are you...

00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:01.860
I see the updraft!

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.350
The path through the wind!

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:06.310
Now!

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.610
Give it the rest of our fuel.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.470
We're blowing a hole right 
through the cloud demon's skull!

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.400
Let it rip, Ryusui!

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.630
This world's skies, too, are mine!

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.350
They're flying...

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.130
They're actually flying.

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:00.460
Chrome...

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.050
Ryusui...

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:05.460
Senku!

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:11.290
Everyone!

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:15.020
Senku and the guys made 
it to Ishigami Village!

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:17.250
They're there already?

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:18.430
Really?

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:20.400
It's only been a few hours.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.030
The world suddenly feels a lot closer.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:24.280
All right!

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.980
The rest of us better get working, too!

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:33.580
It seems science can elevate not just 
balloons, but people's hearts, as well.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:36.150
You're right.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:38.270
Everyone's excited as hell.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:41.350
Can you imagine if the 
ship gets done in no time?

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.450
Gen, I've been wondering...

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.500
You must have known who would 
win the ship idea contest.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.060
So why...

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:57.560
In magic, "forcing" is the technique where 
you make a person choose a certain card.

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:01.720
But making people choose for themselves...

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.020
Or at least making them think 
they chose for themselves...

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.600
That part's really important.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.600
People don't come together under 
the thumb of a strong leader.

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:13.720
Gen...

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:19.350
I'm really glad you sided with 
Senku instead of Tsukasa or Hyoga.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.870
We're here...

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:23.250
We've reached the goal.

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:25.620
That was pretty easy, huh?

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:27.870
Given your skills, Ryusui...

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.700
You lot are no slouches, either.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:35.320
If we, professional adventurers, rely on 
each other and combine our strengths,

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.900
finding oil will be cake.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:46.720
Leave that manly-friendship-
after-a-riverside-duel stuff for later.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.940
Hurry up and help me.

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.180
I'm dead soon.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.790
Hey!

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:57.690
Senku-chan knows really well...

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.090
People are power.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.760
Me, too, Chrome.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.800
What?

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:13.140
I don't know everything about 
this world, and I want to see it.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:17.700
I want to see what's on the 
other side of this world,

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.850
where the petrification beam came from.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.230
Very well, Senku!

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:25.100
I'll take you there,

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.980
to the other side of the planet!

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:36.230
All right, let's take a trip in this balloon 
to get the king of fuel, petroleum.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:41.100
This is exhilarating.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:50.010
