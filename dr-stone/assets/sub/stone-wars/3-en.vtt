WEBVTT

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.550
We have them thinking I'm dead.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.160
You'd better visit my grave regularly.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.480
Taiju-kun.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.220
Look.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.130
Someone's dug it up at some point.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.830
You're right.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.130
Good eye, Yuzuriha. I'm impressed.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.080
Do you think Senku-kun and the 
others buried something for us?

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.820
But what should we do?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.610
There are guards watching.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.150
We can't dig it up with a shovel.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.200
They're visiting that grave day after day.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.110
What, are they talking 
to the dead or something?

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.240
I've got this.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.080
I-Is this...

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.240
Yo.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.780
Senku!

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.790
I missed this all so much, I could cry.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.370
Including your ridiculously loud voice.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.930
Is this the guy we've heard so much about?!

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.260
So that's Taiju!

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.120
It finally connected!

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.260
Our cell phone hot line, 
over an absurd distance!

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.920
Senku!

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.020
It's been just about a year, huh?

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.750
Senku!

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.150
I... Senku...

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.450
I...

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.650
Senku!

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.680
I...

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.240
Senku!

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.330
I am Senku!

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.030 line:20%
I am Senku!

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.840
No, you're not.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.190
<i>I'm</i> Senku.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.010
Call from the Dead

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.920 line:20%
Senku!

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.770
The "cell phone," was it?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.820
To think it really allows him to speak 
to his friend over such a distance...

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.150
It's so impressive, I don't 
even know what to think.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.990
The voice of science known as 
"radio waves" flies through the air,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.500
connecting the faraway enemy 
base with this village, Father!

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.110
Are you done crying yet, you big oaf?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.460
My ear's rotting.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.230
Sorry.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.960
I'm just so happy.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.170
Senku-kun...

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.470
Hey, Yuzuriha.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.700
You worked up to cell phones 
in just a year, huh?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.720
You're amazing. Not that I didn't know that.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.490
What's going on? He's been screaming all day.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.650
Is it the anniversary of 
his death or something?

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.790
I'd love to sit here shaking in 
the awe of our cell phones working

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.370
as we reminisce about old 
times for ten billion years...

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.240
But I think you're gonna have to get going.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.810
I'll get straight to the point.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.460
First, tear someone away from Tsukasa-kun's 
army and drag them to the cell phone.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.470
Make up any reason you need to.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.420
I'll fill in the details.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.050
Are you sure you don't need to rehearse this?

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.080
I don't think he has an option, so long 
as there are guards watching them.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.960
In fact, Taiju, it's better 
that you don't know anything.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.840
Just believe everything I say like the 
idiot you are, even if it sounds crazy.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.300
That's so half-assed!

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.690
I'd be mad if I were Taiju-kun!

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.230
Senku, let me make sure of one thing.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.910
That's the best way to avoid 
bloodshed, is that right?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.610
Yeah.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.920
That's the best way to avoid bloodshed.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.440
All right, I got it, Senku.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.680
If that's what you think, 
I don't need any more explanation.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.900
Even after a year apart, 
their trust is unwavering.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.870
I think I see why Senku and 
Taiju survived against Tsukasa.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.340
We don't have much time left until the 
Tsukasa Army makes its full assault.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.980
Gen will be back tomorrow or so.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.200
The mission begins immediately.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.190
Have you gotten any messages 
from Gen and the others?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.340
No, I haven't heard anything.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.500
All I saw was the receiver buried 
really deep in the ground.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.200
That would have put the phone 
at risk of being found.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.270
That doesn't sound like Gen.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.600
S-Something must have happened.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.570
Why are we hiding in these bushes?!

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.440
Let's go murder any enemies we see!

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.900
Yeah, if only we knew where they were!

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.950 line:20%
Shh!

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.950
You're the type that gets mowed down on 
the battlefield right off the bat, Magma!

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.620
The enemy's name is Ukyo-chan.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.510
He's got insane hearing.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.920
These bushes are bad, then.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.150
Bingo.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.520
If we hide in these bushes,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.080
we'll be making rustling 
noises everywhere we go.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.680
And he's definitely going to shoot us.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.560
In fact, we didn't come to these bushes to hide.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.160
We were <i>lured</i> here.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.810
Damn it!

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.000
We need to get Gen back 
to the Kingdom of Science,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.200
even if we don't make it.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.140
Then we could begin the cell phone 
operation to take down the Tsukasa Empire.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.760
If we only need to get 
Gen home, I have a plan.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.690
First, Chrome, you charge out.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.600
And I follow.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.460
Ooh!

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.710
And then what?

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.840
He's shooting from over there!

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.720
Found you!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.680
Smash!

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.520
Oh, of course!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.920
Wait, no!

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:14.030 line:20%
Shh!

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.640
I'll die if we do that!

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.960
What the hell?

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.650
You're only worried about your own life.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.870
What a selfish bastard.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.030
Says you!

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.790
Why would I be bait for him?

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.810
Bait...

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.750
The spare battery we tried 
to give Taiju and Yuzuriha.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.380
The "positive" and "negative," was it?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.630
Whatever, I just need to connect the ends,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.970
and the wire will heat up like crazy.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.460
The noise and smoke would 
give away our position

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.350
if we sat there rubbing wood to start a fire.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.350
But with science, it's instant.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.760
Oh, shit!

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.670
Oh, shit!

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.680
He's hiding under the smoke and screaming

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.490
to drown out the sound of me 
running through the bushes.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.500
I love it.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.470
This is way better than just lying in wait.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.420
Oh, shit!

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.330
That's it, Gen!

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.410
You have to go, or we'll be making 
ourselves bait for nothing.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.530
You've got the insanely important 
task of talking people

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.960
from Tsukasa's army into joining our side!

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.990
I'll beat you to death if you 
don't make it home alive!

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.610
Oh, shit!

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.250
I already know who to bring to our side first.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.510
There's something I want you to hear.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.480
With the guard on our side,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.520
we should be able to slowly bring everyone 
in the Tsukasa Empire onto our side.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.200
I made some kind of copper swirly!

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.700


00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.700
Clock spring
acquired!!

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.970
The record's spinning so smoothly!

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.710
Spinning it manually messes up the song, 
because it's hard to keep a steady speed.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.240
Even with the record playing perfectly, 
without Gen here, it's all for nothing.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:47.760
Yuzuriha and Taiju are about to bring 
their target to the cell phone.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.730
If Gen doesn't get home 
by then, it's game over.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.320
So, Senku-chan, who's the 
first one I need to win over?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.640
Gen!

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.430
You're okay!

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.680
Nikki-san, was it?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.620
I'd like to talk.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.910
Hear me out.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.910
I won't!

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.040
My job is to watch over you two.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.330
I'm making sure you aren't meeting

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.960
with anyone in secret or 
doing anything suspicious.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.120
Tsukasa would tell me not to let 
you find out, but I don't care.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.970
You two already know, don't you?

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:32.350
Taiju, Yuzuriha, I have no intention 
of getting chummy with either of you.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.350
Give it up.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.130
The only word I'll accept in response is "yes."

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.420
Say any more than that, and I'll pound you.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.500
I don't care!

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.450
I said, say any more, and I'll pound you!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.590
It hasn't hurt him at all.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.360
No, it has.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.480
He's toughing it out.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.120
That's fine.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.090
You can punch me on every second word.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.840
But in exchange, hear me out!

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.830
Hear what my friend has 
to say! It's important!

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.280
What is that?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.440
You're kidding! A phone?!

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.360
In this world? How?

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.990
Hi! I'm Lillian Weinberg.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.980
I don't know much, but even I know 
that she's an American singer.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:40.520
Do you know her, Nikki?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.310
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.800
Of course I do.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.560
And I'm her interpreter, Sebastian.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.950
Sebastian?

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.400
Wait, that's Senku's voice!

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.060
No, he said not to say anything, 
even if it sounds crazy.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.020
Hello? I'm calling from USA.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.950
"I'm calling from America."

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.780
Everyone in Japan, please listen to me.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.430
"Please listen to me, everyone in Japan."

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.740
USA is back from the stone.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.910
"America is back from stone."

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.930
What?!

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.330
Did you hear that, you two?!

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.210
We're saved!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.900
Wow, is that what's going on?

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.800
I think I've figured out their plan.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.890
I can at least tell that 
Senku-kun's trying to play her.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.120
Hold it.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.600
First...

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.230
Lillian was in space at the time.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.390
Yup.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.430
As soon as we returned to 
Earth, we were petrified.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.240
We only recently got restored.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.190
Lillian...

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:58.240
I...

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.430
I was saved so much by your 
songs, you have no idea!

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.900
I had such a rough time 
at school, being so butch...

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.080
And you saved me!

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:15.290
I'd do anything to help you.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.890
But if someone's pretending 
to be Lillian Weinberg...

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.940
I'll make certain they're dead!

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.220
Yeah, this is bad.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.070
She's legit.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.400
We've hit a super-fan right off the bat.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.140
You know, I've always noticed...

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.340
Your luck of the draw really sucks, huh?

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.910
The first person you 
revived was Tsukasa-chan,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.380
lightning strikes right before you're ready...

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:43.750
I can't help...

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.260
but notice something's off about your voice.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.030
If you're the real Lillian, I'm truly sorry.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.390
Could you answer some questions 
so I know you're real?

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.810
If you're really her, you would know.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.020
How many CDs have you sold in total?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.030
What are you going to do, 
Senku-kun, Gen-kun?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.960
There's no way you'd know!

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.820
We've got three options.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.240 line:20%
My memory got wiped when I was petrified!

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.940
One: dodge the question.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.720 line:20%
The answer is ten billion copies.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.960
Two: guess.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.960 line:20%
That's so rude! I'm gonna get angry!

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.280
Three: snap.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.700
What should we do, Senku-chan?

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.760
Four: answer correctly.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.720
Here's a back-of-napkin Fermi 
estimate—a logical approximation.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.240
A seat on the Soyuz spaceship costs 
50 million dollars, or five billion yen.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.540
Supposing Lillian has double that 
in cash, or ten billion yen,

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.980
and given that singers of her caliber 
pull in roughly ten times that on tour,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.750
we find what she makes in royalties.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.760
At least 60 million copies.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.370
I don't know how much more.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.590
Okay, perfect.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.790
Now it's up to me.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:08.360
We had a "50 million copies sold" 
party a while ago,

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.000
but CDs don't make up the majority of 
my sales anymore, so I don't remember.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.820
Sorry.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.590
Should I wake up my manager?

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.150
No...

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.180
She's right.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.470
Then, one more question.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.810
If you can say this number, I'll believe you.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.490
We've got this, Senku-chan!

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:33.000
If it's just hard numbers we're dealing with, 
you can use your Fermi-whatchamacallit, right?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.110
What are your measurements?

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.130
Just give me something rough!

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:41.450
Even if it's not perfect, 
I can tell her I changed!

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.000
I'm counting on you.
The other one is this diva
named Lillian Weinberg.
Apparently she bought
a ticket for $50 million.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.000
Huh.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.000
Senku!

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.000
Check out this photo I got with
my buddies at the Russian base!!

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.520
I gotta estimate from memory.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.760
Byakuya's height, the 
sizes of the equipment...

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.590
Use that to calculate her proportions!

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.470
88-65-85.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.810
You look way skinnier in your profile photos.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.590
How am I supposed to know?!

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.760
She's obviously shopping 
her photos for her fans!

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.250
She's a professional!

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.360
Well, those are my <i>actual</i> proportions!

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.780
Of course. Lillian would never 
tell her fans her real proportions.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.690
She's a professional, even in this world.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.470
She'd keep the fantasy alive for her fans!

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.800
You aren't the real Lillian Weinberg!

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.310
This is seriously bad.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.640
Should we chance it and play her song?

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.460
No, but if a super-fan heard her 
voice after she heard mine,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.760
she'd pick up on it immediately.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.140
Should I keep talking at her?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.560
Or...

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.880
We're playing the record.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.280
The sound quality's better now, 
with the clock spring.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.030
We're betting on science over BS.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.280
Mu...

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.380
...sic!

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.680
Amazing...

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.880
But how?

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.190
Yeah, it's real.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:45.780
Only the song is real.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.950
I'd never mistake it for anything else.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.660
You could never fake it.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:56.840
Do you have any idea how much I...

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.470
How many times I listened to this?!

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.590
Lillian doesn't exist in this world anymore.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.310
Am I right?

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.350
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:30.790
But she lives on forever, if only in 
this song you brought back to life.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.650
This is a science question.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.930
Could you use your power to 
bring back Lillian's other songs?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.810
Yes!

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.890
Senku-chan, you have to say <i>yes</i>!

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.560
No way in hell.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.020
All those wimpy recording mediums have 
turned to dust, ten billion percent.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.570
I can only promise you one thing.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.780
I'll protect this one last song for you,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.830
with the power of science.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.060
You're pretty awkward, aren't you?

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.720
I could tell right away.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.770
You're always honest about science.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.230
It's something to have faith in.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.640
I might fall in love with you.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.140
No, seriously, don't.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.820
I need to protect this record 
with my life in order to trick

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.900
Tsukasa's troops and bring them to our side.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.330
And you want to preserve the 
song, even if it kills you.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.830
We're on the same team.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.040
All right.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.700
We have a deal.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.720
I'll cooperate with your plan!

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:03.980
Thank you, Nikki-san!

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:05.780
We've done it! Finally!

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.470 line:20%
We finally have an ally 
in the Tsukasa Empire!

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.640


00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.640
Nikki the Guard has joined the party!!

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.450
