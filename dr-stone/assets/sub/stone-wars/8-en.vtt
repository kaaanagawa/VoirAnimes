WEBVTT

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.310
I'm so nostalgic, I could cry my eyes out.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.920
Is that...

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.820
Yeah.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.430
It's where Senku and I woke up, 
and where everything began.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.630
The miracle cave.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.410
That's where we get the 
stuff from bat guano...

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.000
Nitric acid.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.650
Nitric acid is used for everything 
from breathing life into the statues

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.020
to making the gunpowder that can destroy 
anything in this primitive world.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.540
The miracle water that 
commands both life and death.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.580
That's why Tsukasa-kun has 
so many people guarding it.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.410
Yo, I won't let your death be in vain.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.370
Senku's objective is the miracle cave.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.520
We'll stop them in the names

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.090
of Yo and the other fallen, 
and build a new, ideal world.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.610
Yes.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090
Tsukasa and Hyoga are at the grave.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.240
It's pretty far from here.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.860
That's fantastic to know.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.980
One blast of this tank's bluff cannon,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.290
and any modern person's morale will 
immediately tank, ten billion percent.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.250
But the enemy will only panic 
and have the instinct to run away

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.420
for the first 20 seconds.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.350
After that, the enemy will come 
to their senses and retaliate.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.020
If we fight, people will die.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.850
T-Twenty seconds later, 
we're killing each other?!

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.370
That's when we kill them all!

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.290
No.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.060
Nobody dies.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.900
That's the condition of our alliance.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.860
Rules are rules.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.140
Break them, and the course 
of the war becomes uncertain.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.040
In other words, 
we're conquering the miracle cave

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.260
with our scientific lightning attack 
without killing a single person.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.590
Well, then, let's get started!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.850
Steam Gorilla, move out!

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.020
Everyone, brace yourselves!

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.150
The fate of all humanity will 
be decided in these 20 seconds!

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.130
Fire!

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:39.600
Sulfuric
acid

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.020
When the glass jar full of 
sulfuric acid shatters on impact,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:39.600
Alcohol
Coal ash
Etc.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.540
it'll mix with the fuel made 
from alcohol and coal ash.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.600
Iron powder

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.370
It'll at least <i>look</i> like a giant, 
Hollywood-budget explosion.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.770
Tsukasa is already expecting the Kingdom 
of Science to attack with a steam engine.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.330
Then the miracle cave 
would be a critical facility.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.610
It must be full of anti-vehicle traps.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.800
Definitely, ten billion percent.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.610
So, Senku-chan, how about a detour?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.400
Denied! Charge!

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.570
Oh, God!

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.870
Go!

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.660
What is that?!

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.330
Wait!

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.710
N-No way...

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.700
It's...

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.000
A tank?!

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.270
We're screwed!

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.340
They're smashing right through our traps!

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.000
Tanks are the best!

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.100
I'm sure you love this stuff, Magma.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.920
We won't need to take a detour.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.940
We've saved precious seconds.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.670
Let's go, everyone! Frontal assault!

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.680
Ambush!

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.270
It's an ambush!

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.360
Damn it!

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.930
The opening is the most 
difficult part of the battle.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.030
The foot soldiers will react 
recklessly in their confusion.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.530
No killing.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.770
How do we respond to their initial 
attacks under these rules?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.320
Taiju!

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.120
I-It shattered!

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.810
Carbon shield!

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.520
Carbon?!

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.410
That's impossible!

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.050
In this stone world?!

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.010
Don't worry!

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.400
I'll stop all the attacks up front!

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.800
One of them already got you in the head!

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.520
He's so tough...

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.730
You guys!

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.470
Hitting people is bad!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.910
What the hell is he saying 
in the middle of a battle?!

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:39.540
Their weapons!

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:41.160
Knock their weapons away!

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.170
Tie them all down!

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.720
Follow Kohaku!

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.480
The tank's finally down.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.480
All right! They fell for our traps!

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.420
Shit...

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.280
This sucks.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.800
We lasted longer than I expected.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.890
Magma, you're up.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.420
Don't boss me around.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.260
Say "please."

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.530
What is that?

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.650
A copper plate?

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.350
It's just a board.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.890
It's an adaptation of one of our science 
surprise gadgets, the sonic bomb.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.900
Copper
board

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.260
We're gathering all the sound 
of a detonation using a parabola

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.900
Sonic bomb

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.170
and shooting it at the enemy.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.470
All units, ear plugs!

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.620
Take this.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.870
Acoustic weapon: the shock cannon!

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.150
Everyone's confused.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:38.650
Tsuka-san told them they're supposed 
to retreat if they're ever ambushed!

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.770
Time to use my journalistic skills!

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.750
I'll go back to Tsuka-san and 
tell him exactly what's going on.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.360
"You're a capable woman. Stay by my side."

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.260
He just might!

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.680
You're not going any further.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.130
No way... Ukyo-kun?

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.410
You're not going.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.810
Nikki—

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.900
Minami-san!

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.370
Damn it! Inform Tsukasa-san!

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.110
Look!

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.500
Don't let anyone get away!

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.210
Chrome!

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.270
Damn it! This is bad! The sonic bomb...

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.340
They're coming!

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.850
It's no use! We can't 
fight off that many people!

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.640
How many casualties?

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.490
Zero.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.660
The miracle cave!

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.570
We've conquered it!

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.520
It's been a long time.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.340
So, going forward, the two of us 
will be spies in the Tsukasa Empire.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.350
You'll be finding allies for a 
scientific revolutionary army.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.770
And we'll each be fighting our own battles.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.000
That's the idea.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.540
I'm getting all teary-eyed 
thinking about our sad goodbye.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.560
It's been a whole year since we parted 
ways with Senku to fight this battle.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.320
Finally!

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.730
We finally have it back!

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.610
This is the nitric acid born from bat guano!

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.180
The miracle water!

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.680
Now we can make all the revival 
fluid and gunpowder we need.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.770
Hey, what are you doing, Senku?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.610
We just won!

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.560
Senku's always so calm.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.310
It takes a while for him to be happy.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.200
Hey, Senku!

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.340
Yeah, I'd love to party my ass off 
to celebrate this victory,

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.570
but we don't have time to waste.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.360
We're going to start making gunpowder.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.080
Crap, he's right.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.120
We need to get ready before Tsukasa 
and the others catch on and get here.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.450
Ta-da-da!

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.460
Sulfur and charcoal!

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.850
This is an instant gunpowder starter kit.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.910
All you need to do is add sulfuric acid.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.460
You're so well-prepared.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.760
Damn straight. We don't have time.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.850
All right, then! Finally!

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.750
Victory for the Kingdom of Science!

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.060
We've got gunpowder!

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.100
Impossible.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.690
They're way too early.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.630
How?!

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.110
Run!

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.650
Everyone, run!

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.960
The gunpowder starter kit 
we so desperately need!

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:42.830
Shit...

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:45.790
All our chemicals...

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.590
We're screwed!

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.720
We don't stand a chance!

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.560
Damn it, are you serious?

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.380
Kohaku-chan and Magma both fought him 
together, and they didn't stand a chance.

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.990
Facing one of them alone would 
have been hopeless enough.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.080
It seems you've all figured 
out instinctively...

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.830
that the Kingdom of Science's chances 
of winning have just become nil.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.930
Hey, Senku.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.250
Yo, Tsukasa.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.470
It's been a long, long battle.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.840
A whole year has passed.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.340
I'm sad to have to take your life twice.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:05.320
That's so cold of you, after I crawled 
my way out of Hell to meet you...

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.110
by climbing up the stupidly 
thin thread that is science.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.090
Damn it! What do we do?

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:18.910
What do we do?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.210
Don't worry!

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.140
Lillian?!

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.400
She's inside the tank!

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.680
All right! Protect her!

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.290
Lillian's inside the tank!

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.980
He's right! We're saved!

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.430
The US Army will be here for us soon!

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.820
That's all a lie, too.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.960
Enough with the charade. Come out, Gen-kun.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.750
Do you really think such a primitive 
phone could communicate with the US?

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.760
Damn it! We've been found out!

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.880
No wonder you guys got here so soon.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.730
Gen!

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.990
You were impersonating her? No way!

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.550
It was a close call.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.480
But the battle has just been won.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.170
You lose, Senku-kun.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.790
And I have a proposition.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:17.990
If you...

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.040
No, you don't have to tell me.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.160
I know.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:29.710
You want science-man Senku to die in 
exchange for the safety of everyone else.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.870
I appreciate your understanding.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.590
You are indeed on the ball.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.630
No!

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.800
Don't, Senku!

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.730
It's going to be the same thing as before!

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.690
I can't let that happen again!

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.900
Quit ugly-crying, you big oaf.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.460
How is it the same?

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.240
Go pluck out your eyeballs and wash them.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.250
Remember, Taiju?

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.950
You weren't enough that time. 
I was on my own.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.990
But this time, right now,

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.060
we've got plenty of us here.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.650
You're here, and so are our 
Kingdom of Science buddies.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.560
Yeah.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.690
You're right, Senku.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.020
That's right.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.070
You've got another science man right here.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.440
Yeah, of course.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.140
The condition of this war 
was that no one dies.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.740
Rules are rules.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.450
That's why we trained so hard.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.240
Without question. Senku is our leader,

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.080
and our friend.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.590
So all we need to do is take them down.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.800
Wow, you're all so passionate.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:10.100
Well, if Senku-chan were to lose, 
I wouldn't get to drink cola anymore.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.620
You're right.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.530
It's nothing like last time!

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.980
Sorry, Senku.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.770
It's been a while, long-haired man.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.110
Now, that's not nice.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.380
Shouldn't you say "Nice to meet you" first?

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.950
Allow me to give you the nice greeting 
I neglected to give last time.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.460
Nice to meet you.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.650
We are the Kingdom of Science.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.690
Do you have some kind of plan, Kohaku?

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.190
Obviously not!

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.810
We need to protect the miracle water.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.910
This is siege warfare.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:09.280
If we can buy even a little bit of time...

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:15.250
Senku and the other science users will 
surely clear us a path to victory!

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.040
Yeah, but we don't have any 
chemicals or anything.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.960
How?

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.450
Run, science user!

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.220
Yeah!

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:28.590
They'll be dying for nothing.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.720
I suppose they're just 
brain-dead primitives after all.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.660
This primitive stone world 
will be controlled...

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.710
...by the pure power given 
to humanity by nature.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.920
...by the science built by humanity itself.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.490
To Destroy and to Save

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.950
Next Episode

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.950
