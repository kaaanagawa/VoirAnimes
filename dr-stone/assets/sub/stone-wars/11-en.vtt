WEBVTT

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.150
Hyoga-sama...

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.410
Are you all right, Senku?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.120
Yeah, I'm in ten billion 
percent perfect shape.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.500
Although it would have been bad if it 
was the first time I'd been speared.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.720
Our training together paid off, Kinro.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.520
All right, let's go ahead 
and kill this Hyoga bastard!

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.610
Killing people is bad.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.480
Why is that always your first thought, Magma?

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.690
How long are we going to 
keep them captive, though?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.100
Until the day we bring
civilization back to the world.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.410
Once we have a scientific civilization, 
Hyoga won't be anywhere near the strongest.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.350
People can hold trials or 
whatever else they need to do.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.190
I have no interest in any of that.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.860
I'm just a science person.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.240
It's finally over.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.870
All of it.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.810
What are you talking about?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.000
It's the opposite.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.390
We're just getting started.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.990
We're all going to work together 
to build a kingdom of science

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.650
in this stone world from scratch.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.810
What the hell is this?!

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.250
Don't just stand there.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.560
Do some work.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.360
We're building science facilities!

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.570
Iron forges and glassblowing stoves!

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.820
We're even going to build a power generator!

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.730
Some of you must have the fuzzy sickness.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.120
Glasses will save you.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960
We have ramen in the science kingdom, too!

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.290
I think that's the last piece.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.100
There are quite a few missing parts, though.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.300
Can it regenerate all these broken parts?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.370
Sure it can.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.910
I think.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.810
According to Senku-chan's hypothesis,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.110
it should work as long as the 
surfaces aren't weathered away.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.340
And if he's wrong about that?

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.370
The moment we pour the 
revival fluid on him, splat!

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.110
Blood everywhere and a 
corpse in a million pieces!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.480
He's alive!

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.630
He came back to life!

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.040
Crap! Crap! Crap!

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.800
My deadline!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.210
How long was I asleep?

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.370
A few thousand years.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.960
I totally missed my deadline, then!

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.810
Here's some paper.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.780
We already have everything 
a manga artist needs.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.240
Yes!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000
Do you know this dude?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.780
Nah, he's a manga artist.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.290
We just happened to find him.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.100
Remember what Senku-chan promised?

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.270
That he would bring back all the world's 
entertainment and fun things to show us?

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.650
This is where our exciting 
scientific civilization begins.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.570
Scientific civilization?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.660
Entertainment?

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.750
When did that happen, and how? Damn it!

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.710
Yo-kun-sama was only gone for a little bit!

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.170
I'm so jealous!

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.880
Yo! 'Sup!

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.780
I fell down a waterfall, and I just 
recovered from amnesia yesterday.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.740
I'll help out, too.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:28.430
Yo!

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.510
This guy's bad news.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.770
He might be the one who let Homura go.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.390
What?!

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.080
But hey, if he's willing to help, 
he's more than welcome.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.280
We need more people, and we have 
a ton of statue puzzles to put together.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.100
Sweet!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.250
Does that clear me of my crimes?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.340
Crimes?

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.370
You just confessed.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.840
How many pieces are we putting together?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.330
Just leave it to m—

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.840
Don't tell me you actually intend 
to put all of these back together?

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.300
Every single one?

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.160
All of them.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.390
Every single one.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.050
Just asking!

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.440
Straight from there, just past the lake.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.560
And then...

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.940
You can't speak, Tsuka-san.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.190
You need to get some rest.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.200
I have to tell you this before the end.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.830
It's finished.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.970
Now that the Kingdom of Science has won,

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.810
the statues that I destroyed 
will have died for nothing.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.400
Don't worry, Tsukasa!

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.460
No one's better than I am at 
time-consuming grunt work!

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.880
If you just tell me where all the broken 
statues are, I'll gather every last piece!

00:06:53.080 --> 00:07:01.060
Tsukasa, do you actually remember every 
single statue that you've busted?

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.380
Of course.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.490
I haven't forgotten them even once.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.270
Really?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.170
We won? We really won?

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.600
Everyone's safe?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.720
No one has died or anything?

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.700
I'm so glad.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.320
Yeah, not anyone from the village.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.570
No, no one has died!

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.360
We promised a bloodless siege.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.180
Senku won't let him die!

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.840
What are you making next, Senku-chan?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.120
We have a ton of modern humans now.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.900
Some of them might even 
recognize what I'm doing.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:11.260
Vinegar

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:11.260
Chlorine

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:11.260
Sulfur

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:11.260
Chloroacetic acid

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:15.010
Sodium chloroacetate

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:15.010
Sodium hydroxide

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.780
Vinegar plus chlorine with a dash 
of sulfur gives us chloroacetate.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:20.430
Cyanoacetate

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.450
Throw in some sodium hydroxide, 
and we get sodium chloroacetate.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:18.510
Sodium cyanide

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:20.430
Alcohol

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:20.430
Formaldehyde

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.080
Get it to react with cyanide made from blood 
and iron, and once you get some cyanoacetate...

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:20.430
Blood

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.430
Iron

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:20.430
Ethyl cyanoacetate

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.920
No, I don't think anyone's going to get that.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.200
Anyway, after all that, you add some 
alcohol to make ethyl cyanoacetate,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.180
then add some formaldehyde to that,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.700
and you get superglue to seal wounds.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.520
And that's going to save Tsukasa-chan?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.580
We're just closing the wound to buy time.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.510
I'm not a magician.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.260
I can't rebuild an organ 
after it's been broken.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.840
Alone with Hyoga-sama...

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.770
Not bad.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.510
You're still as brain-dead and soft as ever.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.960
You won't even execute the 
man who killed your leader.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.460
You're never going to 
run a kingdom like that.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.240
You may not even have 
managed to kill Tsukasa.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.440
That's impossible.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.070
The mediocre always count on miracles.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.080
Miracles?

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.990
Senku doesn't have any 
interest in such a thing.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.460
He treads tirelessly down the path of science.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.960
He's the strongest, 
most patient man in the world.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.770
There's just one way to save you.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.030
Tsukasa, we're going to petrify you.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.290
Sorry!

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.700
Oh, it's you, Mirai-chan.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.950
They said I can't be here, but I got worried 
about my brother, so I had to peek.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.130
Hey! Over here, Yuzuriha!

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.670
I called you because I 
need help with needles.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.560
This is a job for a crafts club member.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.690
When you say "needles," you don't mean...

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.110
Um...

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.460
We obviously don't have any 
anesthetic or anything.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.820
Surgery? Seriously?

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.430
Don't underestimate the 
strongest high school primate.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.410
You don't need anesthetic, do you, Tsukasa?

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.380
Of course.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.940
Mirai-chan!

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.650
Remember, she's still six years old inside.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.980
There's nothing to worry about, Mirai.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.800
Senku's science is always the real deal.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.280
If he can't do it, he'll admit he can't.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:24.630
So long as that man is looking for a way 
to save Tsukasa, he will find a way.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.800
He will, no matter how narrow the chances,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.910
and no matter how many 
years or decades it takes.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.890
It's my own body.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.570
I know better than anyone what's going on.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.970
The surgery is to buy time.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.060
I'm going to die from 
sepsis within a few days.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.350
Yeah.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.230
The only way to save you 
will be to petrify you.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.980
Petrify him to save him?!

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.810
We're going to exploit the 
regenerative effects of

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.490
coming out of petrification to heal him.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.010
Yeah, I get the reasoning.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.460
But do you actually know how to petrify him?

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.360
Relax. What are you, an overly eager kid?

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.130
That's what we're going to find out.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.170
But we don't know how many years it'll take.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.220
There's a ten billion percent chance 
that you'll be dead by then.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.380
So before that happens, Tsukasa,

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.940
I'm going to kill you with my own hands.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.150
What are you talking about?

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.200
I'm going to freeze him to death.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.120
It's literally cold sleep.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.180
In the meantime, 
we'll find a way to petrify him.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:54.830
I'm going to bring you back, 
no matter what it takes.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.790
That's the only way.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.270
Have faith in me... and die.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.770
Of course.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.590
In fact, if I have to die, 
I'd like it to be at your hands.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.400
After all, Senku, 
I've killed you once already.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.050
Oh, yeah, you're totally right.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.180
That's perfect. It'll be my revenge.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.520
So go ahead and die.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:49.610
My adorable Steam Gorilla's going to 
be reborn into something awesome again!

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.950
I need the two pistons 
we used for the engine.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.700
We're taking the cell phone apart, too.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.490
Get all that golden wire!

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.410
Seriously, primitives?

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.790
Shut up.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.340
We're the primitives at this point.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.970
Amazing.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.780
What are you guys making?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.800
Oh, a refrigerator.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.690
A... refrig...erator?!

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.210
Well, more like a freezer.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.540
In this stone world?

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.420
Yeah, that's how modern people react.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.420
That's what I said at first, too.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.330
All I can do now is laugh.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.410
Chugga-chug go the two pumps.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.910
Push air back and forth through 
the part with the gold wire,

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.120
and the heat transfers away... freezing you!

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.880
I'm not entirely sure how 
that works, but damn!

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.450
Are freezers really that simple?

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.240
Modern ones are a little more complicated.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.160
I do know that things don't 
spoil when they're frozen.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:04.250
Yeah, we might end up with a ten billion percent 
flawless way to preserve food along the way.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.580
Petrify beam!

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:15.800
A drip of revival fluid, and we can 
have all the fresh sashimi we want.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.560
Even better, the regeneration effect 
will get rid of the germs, too.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.090 line:20%
Does that mean we can 
use that on boars, too?!

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.090
He's going to use the disaster that 
ended humanity as a convenient tool.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.090
Oh, damn! It's a new science!

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.510
Petrification's awesome!

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.210
We can make it through poor catches, too.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.170
If we can't sustain seven billion people,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.870
all seven billion of us will look for a 
way to sustain all seven billion people.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.210
That's the way science does things.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.280
Throw a freeze dryer in the mix, 
and it's unstoppable.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.720
That'll go a long way to 
solving the food problem, too!

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.210
Yeah!

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.350
We built a refrigerator!

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.470


00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.470
Refrigerator
acquired!!

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.940
Go on, get!

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.660
We're out of here!

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.480
Wh-Why, though?

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:11.610
If you had to kill your friend, 
would you want an audience?

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.610
Those two are both leaders.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.000
It'll be difficult for them 
to talk with others around.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.880
Cold sleep, huh?

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.770
I've only heard of it existing 
in science fiction spaceships.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.300
Spaceships...

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.840
The Soyuz fits three people.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.860
Who would you take with you on a space 
cruise if you had to choose from among us?

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.410
Let's see...

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:08.310
Are you asking me to make 
a list of capable people?

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.660
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.170
I'm just asking.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.830
Why would you want to make 
such idle chatter in the end?

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.020
Can't we just chat idly?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.530
Yeah... Taiju and...

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:39.690
You might not be physically fit enough 
for exploring the planets, Senku.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.200
If I had to take someone, it might be Chrome.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.040
Yeah, I wouldn't need me there, either.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.210
You know that chick with 
the shells on her head?

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.280
What about her?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.460
She's a journalist.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.510
She's a critical source of information 
for choosing who to revive.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.470
I figured she was your type,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.290
that the strongest high school primate would 
have a thing for Marilyn Monroe types.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.970
I haven't considered appearances 
in who I chose to revive.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.230
You're so stuck-up.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.830
By the way, Tsukasa, don't tell 
me you came up with the name

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.240
"the strongest high school primate" by yourself.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:26.440
I never thought of myself that way.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.640
The actual strongest primate would have 
to be the mega-macho mountain gorillas.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.690
They were formidable indeed.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.400
Huh?

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:42.440
I've fought one before, for a TV show.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.060
What are you, a beast hunter?

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.410
You fought a lion, too, remember?

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.320
That thing tasted like shit, 
simmered or grilled.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:01.320
You, Taiju, and I all had contorted faces. 
It was like we lost a dare.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.580
We only survived thanks to Taiju's idea of 
shoving it down with a ton of mushrooms.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.470
That takes me back.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:22.110
Those several days I spent 
with you two were truly fun...

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.720
Senku.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.630
Come to think of it, 
that poison mushroom Taiju ate...

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.700
It's called amanita muscaria.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.860
You hallucinate if you eat a lot of them.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:45.180
Also, it looks just like the thing 
Super Mario eats to grow huge.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.000
But he doesn't get any stronger.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.600
You know why?

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:57.580
It's because Mario only <i>thinks</i> he's huge, 
because he ate the mushroom.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.920
He's tripping balls. Ten billion percent tripping.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:05.970
Right?

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.720
Am I right?

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.070
Right, Tsukasa?

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.110
You protected me, Nii-san.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.460
For years and years.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:37.160
So I'll protect you this time. Forever.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.820
I'll watch over you every day.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.980
I'll make sure nothing breaks.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.060
Well, let's get ready to set out.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.440
We're starting immediately.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.450
We're all together?

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.170
Tsukasa never called for such a thing.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.290
Look at all these people.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.870
I've never seen so many!

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.300
Okay, everyone, listen up!

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.480
So about that mysterious-as-hell 
petrification beam

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.590
that rained down on all of 
humanity 3,700 years ago...

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.680
What was that, anyway?

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.340
I was in the middle of pissing 
in public when I froze, dude.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.060
Weren't you a cop?

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:37.310
If it was some kind of attack, 
humanity won't survive a second time.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.800
That's why we're going to figure out 
the nature of petrification first,

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.780
using science.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.490
The information Byakuya 
and the others left us

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.470
over thousands of years is 
worth its weight in gold.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.870
We're headed to the origin of the light.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.210
The other side of the planet!

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.680
The other side of the planet?!

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.620
How do we get there?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.790
It'll be simple.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.990
Even the Neanderthals made it 
all the way across Eurasia.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.400
Yeah, that took tens of thousands of years.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.390
And they probably had 
ridiculously powerful legs.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.690
Then we're going to get there 
with our heads and hearts!

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.640
All the way to the other side of the planet!

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.770
We can't just walk there, though, can we?

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:20.260
Of course not.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.960
We have to cross the ocean.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.830
That's right, we're all working 
together to build a ship!

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.400
We're heading out into the 
world to solve all its mysteries!

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.580
It's the start of the stone 
world's age of discovery!

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.750
Holy shit!

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.790
I'm going to help, too!

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.920
We can handle building some boats.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.550
Ishigami Village lives with the sea.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.690
I finally get to travel overseas!

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.970
That's your take?

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.060
You're right, though.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.010
We're going on an adventure 
across the world by ship.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.220
Everyone's going to love this.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.590
For real.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.050
He seriously plans to 
travel across the world.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:12.740
The Kingdom of Science is never not serious.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.810
It's been two and a half years since 
I woke up in this rock-filled world.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.420
It's been hard work.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.170
We're finally proceeding along 
the road map for humanity's future.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.800
Yeah.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.850
We're only getting started.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.900
We're finally going to get our hands 
on the truth behind the petrification.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.980
Let's paint over fantasy with human science.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.750
This is exhilarating!

00:23:54.990 --> 00:24:00.000
