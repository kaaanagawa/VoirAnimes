WEBVTT

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.900
This isn't a battle between 
might and science, Tsukasa.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.890
Might <i>is</i> science.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.120
Do you know the ancient 
Greek word for "power"?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.290
It's "dynamite."

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.160
How magnificent.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.390
Let's negotiate, Tsukasa.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.430
She's alive, isn't she, Tsukasa?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.660
Your sister, I mean.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.930
We might be able to heal her.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.970
With the peripheral healing effect 
of reviving from petrification.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.740
We're offering one chance 
to revive your sister.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.120
In exchange, we want a truce.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.380
Mirai...

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.020
Wait, Senku!

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.730
Mirai-chan's naked!

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.740
No!

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.420
You can't revive her now!

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.750
Here we go with your absurd nonsense.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.310
We're in an emergency, in the stone world!

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.360
Who cares if you're buck naked 
or if your peepee's showing?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.150
You really like this plot twist, don't you?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.290 line:20%
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-m!

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.960
We'll figure it out once we wake her up—

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.950 line:20%
Is this about the right size?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.120
That was fast!

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.460
All set, Senku-kun.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.490
Holy crap!

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.850
Wow!

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.490
Th-The stone statue's cracking apart.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.610
It's turning into a real person.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.580
Right, the villagers haven't seen this yet.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.700
The problem is what happens next.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.330
Please.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.530
If it heals Mirai-chan's insides the 
same way it fixed Senku-kun's neck

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.470
when the petrification was undone...

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.170
The revival fluid has practically 
been smacking people

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.060
out of ten billion percent 
certain brain death.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.270
It's not going to have trouble putting 
together another brain or two.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.960
Where am I?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.600
I...

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.850
Mirai...

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.580
Nii-san?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.840
You've gotten old.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.700
You look good, though.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.830
How many years have I been asleep?

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.020
Six years.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.340
No...

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.720
Several thousand years, Mirai.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.010
He kept fighting, knowing there was no cure.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.930
For years and years...

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.740
You've been waiting, haven't you, Tsukasa?

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.610
For this moment, for all this time.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.010
Humanity's Strongest Tag Team

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.300
All right!

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.220
Let's gather our belongings and return to 
the village, where the others are waiting!

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.460
Yeah!

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.500
Mirai-kun.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.250
You have lots of rocks on you.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.160
They're doing a disservice to your beauty.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.230
You should go wash your face

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.980
at the river over there.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.430
Senku...

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.080
We're missing some dynamite.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.410
We used a ton.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.850
Of course we're going to be off by a little.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.090
Yo, I'm the king of materials for a reason.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.460
This is one thing I don't get wrong.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.300
If someone stole it, I would have heard it.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.250
If there's anyone who could have 
fooled my ears, as far as I know...

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.870
He would be the only one.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.370
Huh?

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.150
Mantle's supposed to be in charge 
of watching Homura's cell.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.690
He's gone again.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.200
He's always slacking.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.170
This...

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.670
This is bad!

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.490
Damn it, what the hell?!

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.090
Busted already!

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.380
Damn, I figured out how to 
take the high ground again.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.650
I just need to go abduct Chrome again.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.460
I'm the only one who knows 
where Chrome ran off to.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.440
Senku's main base must be 
somewhere in that direction.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.760
That's it!

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.870
Seriously? That only took me a few seconds!

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.030
I've still got it, man!

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.000
Homura...

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.430
Yo.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.260
Contact Hyoga-sama.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.460
Free me when the time is right.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.270
Hyoga-sama's true objective...

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.350
What?!

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.750
Was that an accident?!

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.050
No, it wasn't.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.730
That sounded like...

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.100
Where was it from?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.880
The miracle cave.

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.740
Get back!

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.010
Has anyone been caught underneath?

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.440
Report!

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.580
The miracle water's buried!

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.430
Now we can't make any more science weapons!

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:00.690
It's Homura.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.780
But why did he attack the miracle cave?

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.560
Homura-chan doesn't do anything on his own.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.590
Not without someone's instructions.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.940
Whose?

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.900
Who else?

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.700
What?

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.600
What is it, Senku?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.320
Hurry, everyone!

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.740
An explosion?

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.120
Why?

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:28.340
I'll go check it out.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.790
Get away from there!

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.550
Mirai! Tsukasa!

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.990
Whether I'd tried to sneak in from 
behind or attack you in your sleep,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.750
I could never erase you, the strongest 
high school primate, Shishio Tsukasa.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.880
So long as there was nothing 
for you to protect, that is.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.040
I was the one who was waiting.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.490
This whole time...

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.300
For this moment.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.160
Senku...

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.310
Nii-san!

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.160
Senku!

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.920
Tsukasa!

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.060
Wait, Kohaku!

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.470
The current is too fast.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.920
And look.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.890 line:20%
Let me go, Father!

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.470
There's no way you'll find them underwater.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.570
Let's go.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.360
We'll find them downstream by the river.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.540
I pierced Tsukasa-kun's chest.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.370
It's fatal.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.080
You won't be able to save him.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.990 line:20%
W-Wait, hang on!

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:36.000
I've already confirmed that 
the river leads to here.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.120
Yeah, I'm sure you did, Hyoga.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.470
There's no way you would have taken 
the risk of jumping in the river.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.770
Indeed.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.120
I wanted to make sure Tsukasa-kun 
couldn't get in my way

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.440
before I talked to you in private.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.720
What are you, a middle schooler 
meeting me behind the

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.740
school building to confess to me?

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.390
Sadly, I'm already married.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.320
Wait, I'm divorced.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.330
I don't have a single thing 
to talk to you about.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.750
I'd expect so.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.730
But I'd like you to hear what I have to say.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.380
Whether I get you to act 
by persuasion or by torture

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.710
doesn't make much of a difference.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.500
Tsukasa-kun and I were in agreement 
on our fundamental belief:

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.440
that the petrification phenomenon that rained 
down on this planet thousands of years ago

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.810
was to select certain humans...

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.940
To thin us out.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.230
Oh?

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.150
That's a ten billion percent 
un-exhilarating idea.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.710
Don't forget that unjustified 
personal theories are nothing

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.870
but jokes in the world of science.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.260
Let's dispense with the platitudes, Senku-kun.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.880
I'm sure you're well aware.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.850
There's absolutely no way that this 
planet can sustain seven billion people.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.030
Then who is to live on?

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.520
Hyoga, what do you think?

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.930
It's the lives of the young, who have 
a future, that should have priority.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:21.530
We can dismiss the the established powers 
who do nothing but take from

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.550
the young have-nots and create a new world.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.920
High-and-mighty Tsukasa-kun 
was aspiring to a shangri-la,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.280
where no one takes from one another.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.370
I don't have a shred of 
interest in such a thing.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.100
If we're left with nothing 
but brain-dead youths,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.420
we'd still be taken from 
in order to keep them fed.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.720
What's needed is a selection.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.220
We must allow only the elite 
of this world to survive.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.060
The mediocre must all perish.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.200
That's the most logical answer, is it not?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.630
We, humanity, were given that 
chance by the petrification—

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.310 line:20%
Yeah, that's so incredibly logical.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.450
It's logical, but it isn't exhilarating.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.890
If we can't sustain seven billion people,

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:19.570
all seven billion of us will look for a 
way to sustain all seven billion people.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.840
That's the way science does things.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.390
Indeed, Senku-kun, your scientific 
abilities are impressive.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.350
I know you can make nitric acid, 
even if it takes time.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.410
Let's conquer the world and select 
the right people for humanity.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.110
The two of us could form 
an unstoppable tag team.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.550
Your answer is "yes."

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.710
Until you say that, you'll lose one finger at a time.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.910
After that, your legs.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.200
I told you, didn't I?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.740
You don't have a choice.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.080
Get back, damn it!

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.840
Stay away from me!

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.490
How embarrassing.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.640
It's too late for this, Senku-kun.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.860
It seems I overestimated you a bit.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.110
Shut up!

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:51.000
But I'll promise you one thing: 
you will never be in danger again.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:58.720
I betrayed our promise once before.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.650
And yet, you kept yours.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.110
It's my turn to uphold my end of our promise.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:18.600
This time, I won't let harm 
come to you ever again.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.580
Because from now on, <i>I'll</i> be fighting!

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.340
That only means I need to 
take you both out together.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.340
Now that my only equal in this 
world is on his last legs,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.510
I am the strongest of the primates.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.530
Hyoga is saying that to break our spirits,

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.120
but what he says about the 
state of our battle is true.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.000
Yeah, I bet.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.020
It's definitely true if you say so, Tsukasa.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.650
Let's fight together, Senku.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.030
Yeah.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.320
Let's tag-team this guy.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.990
We're going to murder him 
with science and might.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.580
This is exhilarating!

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.710
They're chatting to buy time 
as they discuss their plans.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:10.480
Not that I'm going to wait for them.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.760
A wounded boar and a man 
with no fighting abilities

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.180
would make for the weakest 
tag team in all mankind.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:30.320
I'm keeping my eye on you, too, Senku-kun.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.990
Your eleven!

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.980
Gunpowder!

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.640
The dude's a freak.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.700
Now he's coming for me, 
without missing a beat.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.050
I can use science to kill 
you with one finger!

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:27.040
Only a primitive would fall for 
such a brain-dead bluff, Senku-kun.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:57.130
Tsukasa-kun, you have no 
chance against me right now.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.280
I'm sure you've known from the beginning

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.890
that the hole in your lung is fatal.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.790
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.630
So why do you struggle?

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.720
Your fate has long been sealed.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.160
I don't know, either.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.930
Maybe I was motivated to fight for as long

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:30.100
as I could because that's 
just how much fun it was.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:36.610
We got to fight together 
fleetingly, in the end.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.760
Is that so?

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.960
Well, that's very unfortunate.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.800
Your fun is about to end.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.460
Yeah, it's over.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.880
A bandage over his finger?

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.830
Where I cut it?

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.750
I told you.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:13.940
I can use science to murder 
you with the tip of my finger.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.350
I see...

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:20.320
That flame earlier... 
How did you light it so quickly?

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.200
Primitive science isn't all bad.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.170
If these were lithium batteries, 
your jab would have blown me up.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:35.710
Manganese batteries are tough enough 
to be both a weapon and a shield.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.830
How?!

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.090
From where?!

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:39.750
When did you construct such a thing?!

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.900
Have you forgotten already?

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.510
Hyoga, you were the one who was kind 
enough to deliver the materials to me.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.490
Hook some batteries up to the 
thin wire coil from a cell phone,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.520
and you get a high-voltage transformer.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.790
It's the birth of a 100,000-volt stun gun.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.410
I had fun, too, Tsukasa...

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.030
tag-teaming with you.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.800
Enjoy the gift of science, 
from Tsukasa and me.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.600
Wretched science...

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.950
