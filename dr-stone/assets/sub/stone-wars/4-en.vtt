WEBVTT

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.760
Lillian doesn't exist in this world anymore.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.780
Am I right?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.740
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.190
But she lives on forever, if only in 
this song you brought back to life.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.380
I can only promise you one thing.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.740
I'll protect this one last song for you,

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.510
with the power of science.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.360
I need to protect this record 
with my life in order to trick

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.320
Tsukasa's troops and bring them to our side.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.750
And you want to preserve the 
song, even if it kills you.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.320
We're on the same team.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.470
All right.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.220
We have a deal.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.150
I'll cooperate with your plan!

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.450
Thank you, Nikki-san!

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270
We've done it! Finally!

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.970 line:20%
We finally have an ally 
in the Tsukasa Empire!

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.050


00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.050
Nikki the Guard has joined the party!!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.200
Senku, Gen, your grand scheme to convert

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.090
the Tsukasa Army using the 
diva's voice isn't a bad one.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.650
It's not bad...

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.110
But our crucial fake 
Lilian has an accuracy...

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.540
of 55%!

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.640
You're so strict!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.620
Gotta take the input of a megafan seriously.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.000
But you can leave it to me.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.560
I'll brush you up so no one 
can tell the difference.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.550
That sounds fantastic.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.570
Oh, God, she's going to be Spartan.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.970
Now that I'm on your side, 
you can rest easy on that point.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.430
But there's just one big problem.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.160
I'm sure you guys know how strong Tsukasa is.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.950
But it's not just him.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.280
The people around him are formidable, as well.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.150
I suppose he's got some grandiose 
vision for the world.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.720
He's been gathering capable 
people from all over.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.030
Sure, not all of them worship Tsukasa,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.340
but once they get a taste of Tsukasa's 
might and charisma, they all nod yes.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.300
His right-arm and left-arm men—

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.310
although he definitely doesn't 
consider them such—

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.850
are the ones he considers 
his most capable allies.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.130
You've already met one of them.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.600
Hyoga.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.370
Yeah.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.610
The problem is the other man.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.240
The greatest impediment to our plan...

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.310
would be Ukyo.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.000
Full Assault

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.140
Ukyo-kun.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.150
The guy with the bow and arrow.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.880
Yeah.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.260
If we keep playing the same record repeatedly, 
Ukyo will eventually see through it.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.320
Rather, he'll hear through it.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.070
If he were to hear it, I'm not sure it 
would fool him, even over the phone.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.120
I see.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.480
We can't play the same song over and over.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.230
Then we just have to not 
play it over and over!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.870
You're an optimistic simpleton, 
aren't you, Taiju?

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.420
I like that about you.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.700
That's true, though.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.000
Instead of catching people one by one,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.540
maybe we should get everyone 
while Ukyo-kun's not watching.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.060
That might work.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.190
Ukyo?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.050
He was a sonar operator on a submarine.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.420
He's got insanely good hearing.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.820
That's why Tsukasa-chan woke him up.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.440
Chrome-chan and Magma-chan 
are holding him off for now.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.130
I hope they're safe.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.790
Chrome...

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.050
I'll make sure your death wasn't in vain.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.810
Ground

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.810
Plants

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.810
Clothes

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.810
Rock

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.280
Shut up! I'm not dead!

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.590
I haven't been hit once!

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.770
Hey, you're alive.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.620
You were so pale, I thought you'd croaked.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.620
I was just catatonic for a 
moment because I thought I did.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.860
You used me as a shield after all!

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.200
Thanks to the arrow that nearly 
hit you, I know where Ukyo is.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.380
Idiot! Wait, Magma!

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.690
The arrows are coming from all directions.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.280
He's moving around so we 
can't pinpoint his location.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.640
He's taking advantage of the smoke.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.510
Ukyo's bad news.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.910
Meathead Magma's going to be no match.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.940
That way!

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.530
Think scientifically.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.350
If he can shoot at me from any direction,

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.400
that means Ukyo has a complete 
spatial understanding of where I am,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.080
given his insane hearing.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.000
So why did he just miss every shot?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.580
We couldn't have gotten that lucky.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.170
Ukyo isn't trying to kill us.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.640
He's trying to catch us unharmed 
so he can interrogate us!

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.760
In which case...

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.080
The best way to ensure 
that none of us get hit is...

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.000
Damn it, Chrome.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.680
Where are you?

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.380
Bastard!

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.090
Screw the rope.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.370
What's going on?

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.850
You have no intention of running away.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.320
You raised a white flag on 
purpose, too, didn't you?

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.780
You did it to save the meathead and 
the other person who ran away.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.040
I would have had to shoot the meathead 
if we'd waited for the smoke to clear.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.690
I knew it.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.130
He's after information, not my life.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.450
That was impressive decision-making 
in the heat of the moment.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.490
You've effectively beaten me.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.300
Oh, yeah?

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.730
No!

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.620
He's trying to interrogate me!

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.920
Well, crap.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.230
I'm not falling for that.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.150
Okay, we're here.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.280
It's you.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.680
You don't need to introduce yourself.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.860
I can tell. You've got a different
 aura from the rest.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.250
I don't believe we've met before.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.330
I've been meaning to meet you, Tsukasa!

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.940
I like your spirit.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.830
Are you with Senku?

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.830
That's right, damn it, I am!

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.650
My name is Chrome.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.380
I'm a science user of Ishigami Village!

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.380
Someone's coming.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:23.980
No...

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.890
Chrome's been captured 
by the Tsukasa Empire!

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.400
Well, what's the plan, twig?

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:34.730
Kohaku!

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.130
She's not going to help 
him by herself, is she?

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.410
She's so quick to act.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.690
Stop Kohaku!

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.870
But how?

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:45.540
There's no one in this village 
who can catch up to Kohaku-chan!

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.330
Get back here, lioness.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.010
I'm not a lioness!

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.790
Hey, she stopped!

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.500
Let me go, Father!

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:54.580
You fool.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.750
What do you hope to do by charging 
into enemy territory alone?

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.310
Then what do you want to do?

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.960
Are we abandoning Chrome?!

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.770
If she can't do it on her own, 
why not all go together?

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.980
Do you mean...

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.300
The entire army of the Kingdom 
of Science is moving out!

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.660
Now that we've isolated Homura the 
scout, there's nothing to wait for.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.680
We'll all move out and set up 
camp near the Tsukasa Empire.

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.410
From there, we'll have a shot 
at bringing Chrome back.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.610
I'm too terrified to go 
near the Tsukasa Empire!

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.870
H-Hey...

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.220
Why don't we just hold our 
ground here and wait instead?

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.950
Winter will end in half a month.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.670
Sit here in wait, and Tsukasa's 
army will come to end us.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.530
Yeah.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.980
Offense is the only effective defense.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.070
I know, right?

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.690
That's what I thought, too!

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.480
Ginro, you...

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.860
Are we bringing all your science stuff, too?

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.330
Without it, there's a ten billion 
percent chance of failure

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.780
in getting Chrome back, let alone 
of defeating Tsukasa after that.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.990
It's so heavy, though.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.130
There's no way we can carry all this.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.320
What do we do?

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.290
That won't be an issue.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.970
Wait, no way!

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.270
We're making an automobile!

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:31.890
Tree

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.810
Bamboo

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.270
Here we go again! Seriously?!

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.270
Tire

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.770
Iron

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.860
Furnace

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.860
Steam engine

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.860
Honeycomb

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.790
Exhilarating, isn't it?

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.860
Water wheel

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.860
Lathe

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.520
Sure, it's exhilarating, but...

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.740
Automobile

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.520
You're having fun, aren't you, Senku-chan?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.280
Even in these circumstances...

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.410
Amazing! Is this a schematic or something?

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.010
He's drawing so many circles and triangles 
and lines that my eyes are getting tired.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.550
You're pumped, huh, Senku-chan?

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:11.050
Well, yeah, we're building a car.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.190
We're making a giant Mini 4WD model.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.280
All right, let's go with this.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.420
It's ten billion times 
more primitive than what

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.150
we've been using in our 
rockets, but it'll work.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.280
It's a wobbler engine!

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.200
We throw this into boiling water.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.580
Honeycomb.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.410
Oh, yeah, honeycomb.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.990
The stuff we went to gather 
when we made plastic.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.310
We got attacked by a ton of bees.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:44.600
It was awful.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.260
Everyone turned into Anpanman.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.710
And then we ended up not 
using it for making plastic.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.130
Just awful.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.260
It was just a byproduct of 
gathering honey, anyway.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:01.110
We didn't need it because we ended up 
with a simpler shape for our cell phone,

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.630
but our parts this time 
are going to be complex.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.240
Your hard work will be valuable.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:11.240
Boil honeycomb into a block, 
and you get beeswax.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.750
Candles?

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.910
It's the stuff you use to make 
crayons and lipstick and stuff.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.030
We're making the engine out of this?

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.880
It carves so cleanly on this spinny thing.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.550
A waterwheel lathe...

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.630
Basically, a rotating cutter.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.910
We'll make our intricate parts with this.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.440
Is it really going to work with 
something as brittle as wax? Really?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.400
Yeah, that won't be one 
millimeter of a problem.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.930
We use plaster to form a mold around 
the intricate parts we've made from wax.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.150
Then we melt down brass 
and pour it into the mold.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:55.440
Ah, so we aren't actually using wax parts.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.790
I guess that's obvious.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.560
We're tearing down the 
furnace that Senku made us.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.710
I know spring is coming soon, 
but what are we using it for?

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.570
Who knows?

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.930
Senku says he wants it.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:16.870
He sounded so happy as he said, 
"This is perfect. Science is all about reuse."

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.600
I can picture him saying it just like that.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.560
We're putting the whole 
steam engine on the car.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.670
The way it works is simple.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.270
Heat water over the furnace, 
and you get steam.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:29.240
Yeah.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.300
On the end of that, we attach 
the part that you built, Kaseki.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.520
The steam pushes it downward.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.410
Think of it like a reverse pump.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah, yeah!

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.170
Put that reverse pump on a saucer, 
and it'll push, turn, and pull.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.380
That's the wobbler engine.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.940
You guys sure are enjoying this, aren't you?

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.520
They've completely forgotten 
about their goal of using the car

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.140
to send in the whole army to save Chrome.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.960
Don't worry about it.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.190
As far as Tsukasa's men are concerned, 
Chrome's just a wimpy villager.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.090
I'm sure they're taking good 
care of him as a hostage.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.530
As long as he keeps his 
mouth shut, he'll be fine.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.730
We're talking about Chrome.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.540
"As long as he keeps his 
mouth shut, he'll be fine"?

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.330
We're talking about Chrome.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.220
She said it twice.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.960
Maybe we should pick up the pace.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.330
We're going to be busy!

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.860
What is this? What's going on?

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.350
The three top men are here.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.310
Ukyo...

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.230
Hyoga...

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.390
Tsukasa!

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.140
Wait, who's the guy with the headband?

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.770
Why did you declare that you're a scientist?

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.940
If Senku had told you of the situation,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.240
you'd know that you're only 
putting yourself at more risk.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.140
That's right, Tsukasa.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.370
I'm here to teach you straight-up, 
science-killer Tsukasa.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.250
I'll teach you how cool science is!

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.380
Listen up!

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:13.420
First, we have...

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.180
colorful flames!

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.900
Crap, I messed up.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.180
Completely.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.870
I should have pitched ramen 
or cotton candy first.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.270
Would you like to tell us what 
brings you, a scientist, here?

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.660
Of course, if you don't, 
you'll just end up dead.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.630
I can't tell them I brought a cell phone!

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.310
I'm actually going to die.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.330
Shit!

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.770
Chrome,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.800
it's not that I'm entirely against 
a scientific civilization.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.480
In fact, we use fire and tools here, too.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.560
That's science just as much as anything.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.270
But you have no idea how 
thoroughly the past world was

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:15.000
tainted by established powers 
using weapons of science.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.740
There needs to be restraint.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.970
This beautiful world was purified 
by someone, for some purpose,

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:26.500
and Senku is now trying 
to tarnish it once again.

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.390
This is an opportunity.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.290
Why don't you join us, Chrome-kun?

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.290
If you hand us Senku's head, I can 
promise you all the flame tests

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.570
and science tricks to keep you happy, 
and the safety of everyone in the village.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.960
That doesn't sound bad,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.330
compared to dying.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.010
Is that what you thought I'd say?

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.480
Hurry up and drop me.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.560
That right?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.320
He was completely unwavering 
in his conviction,

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.470
even with his death waiting at the bottom.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.360
A bridge?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.360
There's no point in pushing him any further.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.950
He won't turn, neither for carrot nor for stick.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:52.210
We'll just have to make a 
guess as to why he's here.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.340
Ukyo-kun, where did you find him?

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.480
That's right.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.220
Ukyo knows we were up to 
something at the graveyard.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.050
It won't take long for them to check 
it out and find the cell phone.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.870
Damn it, this is bad.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.730
Shit! We're screwed!

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:11.840
Shit!

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:18.010
Chrome-kun was scouting out 
the miracle cave by himself.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.860
He must be after the nitric acid.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.220
What's going on?

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.710
I mean, I'm saved, but...

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.520
Why would you lie to Hyoga and Tsukasa?

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.060
Man, what's up with this Ukyo guy?

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.920
Is he trying to start a revolution in 
the Tsukasa Empire or something?

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.060
Now it's just model-building.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.270
We're putting it together 
using melted iron and solder.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.690
Wh-What is this thing?!

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.910
Now we can go save Chrome!

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.400
It's a living iron creature 
built from nothing.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.920


00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.920
Steam engine
acquired!!

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:23.320
A living creature, huh?

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.000
It's her first time seeing something 
that moves on its own.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.760
Can't blame her for thinking that.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.440
This is it! It's finally here!

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.190
The Industrial Revolution!

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:05.620
The Kingdom of Science Railway 
steam engine's destination...

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.540
is the Tsukasa Empire.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.990
