WEBVTT

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.870
Hang in there for the 
short while that I'm gone.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.320
Hey, you've been waiting 3,700 years.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
A few more months or years is no big deal.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.520
We're going to build our Kingdom of Science.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.910
Sound of explosives.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.880
Run!

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.320
I'm going to get the Kingdom of 
Science's custom-built cell phone

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.010
to Taiju and Yuzuriha even if it kills me!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.480
Why do we have to be so sneaky?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.110
They're going to follow us if they see us.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.070
Our top-secret cell phone plan would 
be wasted right then and there.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.400
If it's that scout Homura 
we're worried about,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.220
why don't we just kill her or catch her?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.600
Sure, if we knew where she was hiding!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.700
Although, right now, Homura-chan has 
no option but to come out of hiding

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.880
to check out the situation.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.410
It's gunpowder that they're 
worried about, after all.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.560
There's no way someone 
whose job is to keep watch

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.470
isn't going to check out 
such a huge explosion.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.240
If Homura's going to show up,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.650
it'll be along the line between that hill 
and where the sonic bombs went off.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.270
I just saw something!

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.070
A shadow moving really quickly!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.180
She's already gone to catch her.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.810
Kohaku-chan sure is impressive.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.460
She's so proactive and decisive.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.660
Senku gave us this one-in-a-million 
chance with his sonic bombs.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.120
I have to catch Homura, no matter what!

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.340
Explosion craters.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.190
Chills.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.520
My neck.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.950
How is she moving like that?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.070
Gymnastics.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.470
You, born in this age, wouldn't know.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.660
I don't intend to kill you needlessly.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.720
I know. Hit with back of sword.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.480
How long will you chase me?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.350
Until I catch you.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.540
You can't.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.540
Give up.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.230
Stop resisting and let me restrain you!

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.770
Never happen.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.820
I'm trying to exhaust her 
by making her talk, but...

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.380
Kohaku...

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.070
I can't lose her.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.610
Homura... I can't get any closer.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.100
She's fast.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.100 line:20%
She's fast.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.710
I'm going to have to herd 
her toward the village.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.950
They're coming this way!

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.010
Seniors and children, take shelter!

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.920
Everyone else, surround her!

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.190
Senku?

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.050
Aren't you curious?

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.730
Scoop your eyes out and take a good look.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.740
The level 2 science surprise gadget: the flare.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.660
What is this?!

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.490
Long time no see!

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.670
I'm Mecha Senku!

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.010
I'm gonna teach you how to make flares.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.320


00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.320
Got 
bittern!

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.320
First, boil sea water to make 
this stuff called "bittern."

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.770
Melt that down and zap it with 
electricity, and you get magnesium!

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.620
Shove it in a light bulb, and you're done.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:45.900


00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:45.900
Got 
bittern!

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.090
This is the stuff they use in Print Gocco.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:45.900

You've never heard of Print Gocco?

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.140
Ask your mom and dad.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.900
They might know!

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.800
I thought Senku was a wimp!

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.290
He's awesome!

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.660
Watch where you're touching me.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.640
Think about who you're trying 
to pull that trick on.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.200
Once we're done building civilization, 
I'll play the pure, innocent boy all you want.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.610
Should I force my way out and run?

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.430
There's no way I can stand up against...

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.380
It was a total fail!

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.190
What a wimp!

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.530
It's not a matter of strength.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.320
How is that woman moving like that?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.450
She's gotten away.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.410
My eyes are still flickering.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.380
I guess having good eyesight 
has its downsides.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.600
Kinro.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.800
Ginro.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.590
Kohaku.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:49.850
Suika.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.020
Kaseki.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.320
Jasper.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.580
Kokuyo.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.880
Turquoise.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.060
Mantle.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.060
Argo.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.120
How do you know all our names?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.440
It seems that's how thoroughly 
she's been observing us.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.790
Everyone else from the village is here, 
but Chrome, Magma, and Gen are missing.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.820
Something's wrong.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.850
Where are they?

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.080
Chrome, the technician, 
and Magma, the brawn.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.960
Are they mining for gems?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.720
No, they wouldn't need Gen.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.350
Why is Gen with them?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.170
To guide them?

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.150
Where?

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.220
They're taking something to our headquarters.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.360
What's so important to require a diversion? 
A critical weapon of science?

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.090
What?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.900
She must have figured out that Chrome 
and the cell phone team are on the move.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.870
This is bad!

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.540
I guess we can't count on tracking her.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.930
Chrome and the advance party are headed 
straight for the Tsukasa Empire headquarters.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.440
Homura is chasing them.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.310
It's only a matter of time before 
she discovers their cell phone.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:17.170
If she destroys it or even just 
notifies Tsukasa, it's over.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.110
Please, no!

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.560
We worked so hard on it!

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.990
We're going to have to catch her first.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.620
Homura-chan's going after Chrome and 
the others, and we have to chase her?!

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.320
That's so complicated!

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:38.370
Time to bust out the level 3 science 
surprise, our final weapon.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.170
All the spots he's lighting up...

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.210
...are leaving marks.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.270
Well, we're out of time.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.520
Let's get started.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.210
It's the start of our 
happy double pursuit race.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.980
These markings dotting the 
way are Homura's path?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.530
Why can we see this light, though?

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.350
Come on, wake up.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.400
You guys have seen it before.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.210
The blue gems!

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.830
In powdered form.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.870
I see!

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.740
You put it on Homura's arms and legs!

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.170
Oh?

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.960
I thought it only lights up 
briefly just before dawn.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.930
Ultraviolet light.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.710
This light of science 
produces it artificially.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.130
The black light.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.770
Nickel, barium...

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.390
We needed all those treasures 
we found in the cave to make it.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.140
Barium

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.140
Nickel

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.140
Glass

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.140
It's basically just a purple light bulb 
we made by mixing them with glass.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.830
We can follow these.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.680
We can find her!

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.950
Senku, let me make something clear.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.830
Homura's movements are exceptional.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.720
Gymnastics.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.150
It's a skill that doesn't exist in your age.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.510
We won't be able to capture her unharmed.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.760
But I could behead her with my sword.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.250
We could even accomplish a bloodless siege.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.010
Am I free to kill her?

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.520
Kohaku, have you ever killed a human being?

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.660
Of course not.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:47.070
That's why, the moment 
I must do it, I'll hesitate.

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.330
My weakness will be exposed.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.450
In order to have the conviction 
to go through with it,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.710
I must impress it upon 
myself with forceful words.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.420
Relax.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.350
You might not even get a chance to use that 
horrible thing you have on your waist.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.230
Why do you think we worked so hard 
on that ridiculously huge box?

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.730
The ultimate weapon of modern 
warfare: information communication.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.920
No, no, no!

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.740
Is anything broken? The vacuum tubes?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.580
Either way, we should check 
it every now and then.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.020
It rang!

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.990
Stop!

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.300
Don't answer it, Chrome-chan!

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.640
Why not?

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.260
It stopped.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.320
There's only one reason they 
would call at this stage.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.890
And it was one ring.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.000
Homura-chan found us.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.810
We're being chased!

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:58.150
If she saw us talking, she'd realize 
we're carrying a cell phone.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.280
Our job is still to keep 
going as if we're oblivious.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.990
This race is a doubled-up game of tag.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.600
Chrome, who's carrying the cell phone...

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.380
Homura, who's chasing them...

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.480
And us, chasing Homura.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.800
But what happens if we coordinate 
via radio in this situation?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.970
Our game of tag suddenly 
turns into a pincer attack!

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.000
That's information warfare.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.990
Hyoga-sama...

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.040
This is bad.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.960
The light ends after this river.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.230
Damn it, she washed all the powder off.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.560
She must have noticed it 
glowing in the morning sun.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.470
Also, why is this so-called 
"cell phone" ringing on and off?

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.840
Gen-sensei is one-ringing us.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.830
He's using the ringer to send us Morse code.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
Where are you?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
Following the river. 
20km down.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
We're chasing
Homura!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
Crap! Passing
the 25km point.
What now, 
Senku-chan?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
Heh, heh, heh!
Proceed with the
pincer strategy!

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:26.450
Roger!

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.200
We can't use voice, 
so we're texting each other.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.850
That would be one way to think of it.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.230
That doesn't help at all.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.450
We don't get your scientific 
civilization analogies.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.710
Gen's reported locations

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.830
and Homura's route have matched 
up for the past several kilometers.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.610
Which means Homura has caught up to 
them, and she's following them now.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.040
That information is worth its weight in gold.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:42.530
With Homura in front of us,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.800
and with us communicating our 
positions using our cell phones,

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.970
we can see where every piece is.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.980
It's an information pincer.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.630
Nope, no good.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.670
It's not picking up a signal anymore.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.390
Chrome-chan, can you set 
it up on top of a tree?

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.210
Sure.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.010
"Signal"?

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.950
No way...

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.360
In this stone world?

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.370
A communicator?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.490
I have to make sure.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.150
As a scout!

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.170
I could destroy it right now.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.730
This is my only chance.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.120
It's fake?

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.060
Why?

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.080
Gen's switch-out magic trick!

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.150
Can't land safely.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.320
Death... assured.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.610
Goodbye, Hyoga-sama.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.320
Now!

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:08.430
You may be fast, but if we know everything 
about when and where you show up,

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.760
we can capture you unharmed!

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.100
Yes!

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.290
Exhilarating, isn't it?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:23.460
This is information warfare, 
brought to you by the Kingdom of Science.

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.060
We're here.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.570
Finally! We made it!

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.040
Final boss Tsukasa's main base!

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.720
Shh, Chrome-chan!

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.050
There's a guy with crazy hearing 
in Tsukasa-chan's army.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.310
My bad.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.060
Damn, if we get caught after 
coming all the way here...

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.110
Jeez, it's a statue.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.030
Damn... They all look so strong.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:19.880
Something's written in blood on its face.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.980
Looks like priority numbers 
for when to revive them.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.880
Those weren't there when I last saw them.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.380
The lowest number is 33.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:36.850
Which means Tsukasa-chan's revived 
at least 32 people since then.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.910
He's going quite a bit faster than I thought.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.020
Even if we keep bringing 
people over from his army,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.170
it won't matter if he keeps 
making soldiers even faster.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.740
This is pretty bad.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.160
Why don't we just wreck 
all of them right now?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.070
No, even that's too much work.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.580
Just break their arms or 
legs off as we find them,

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.830
and they won't be able to fight.

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.430
You're pretty brutal, Magma.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.660
I totally forgot, since you'd 
kind of become an ally.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.180
He's merciless when it comes to his enemies.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:23.450
Although, if we had to choose, 
it's probably best to destroy them now.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:41.450
Aw, shucks, I can't.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.000
These statues did nothing wrong.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.250
Maybe if they were major 
villains or something, but...

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.770
We humans can pretend 
we're realists all we want,

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.630
but when it actually comes 
time to kill someone...

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.240
We're so weak, aren't we?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.960
So weak.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:10.030
That's why Tsukasa-chan's so dangerous, 
because he can go ahead and do it.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.150
We have to stop him.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.030
You aren't weak.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.360
We're aiming way higher.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.510
To try not to spill any blood.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.290
We just need to convert people faster 
than Tsukasa can grow his army.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.660
So let's go.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:32.960
Our mission is to build a cell phone 
hot line as soon as possible.

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:42.400
Dude, Magma, you were totally about 
to casually destroy those statues.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.220
Why do you care? They're strangers.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.020
Sure, right.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.520
I'm so glad Magma-chan's on our side.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.320
Where are we?

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.390
A grave.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.490
For Tsukasa's men?

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.450
No.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.860
Then who?

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.720
It's Senku-chan's grave.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.710
Senku is dead?!

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.080
He's obviously alive.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.340
It's a fake, to make Tsukasa think he's dead.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.170
We have them thinking I'm dead.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.650
You'd better visit my grave regularly.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.970
So Senku's grave is where 
we exchange materials, huh?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.750
It's a perfect holy ground.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.580
Tsukasa's men don't have 
any interest in my grave.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.650
And even if they go there often,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.610
his men would think it's 
just to pay respects.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.310
They're going to gather there 
to communicate with the dead.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:45.170
It's the birth of a ghost communicator.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.620
He's so good, isn't he?

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.370
It's a grave, so it wouldn't seem odd 
for them to be talking to a dead man.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.550
But this... might be a bit too obvious.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.030
That's totally going to draw attention!

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.490
Damn it, this stone's in the way.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.340
You don't give a damn about 
anything, do you, Magma?!

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.690
Just hurry up and hide it!

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.720
Looks like we got away with it.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.300
You scrawny wimps freak out way too much.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.780
We don't know yet.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.830
I told you, there's a guy with crazy hearing—

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.890
I definitely heard something 
from around here.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.240
If someone from Tsukasa's army finds 
the cell phone first, we're done.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.290
They've got the mentalist with them.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.570
They aren't going to make it that obvious.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.410
Besides, those two will be fine.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.540
They're a tag team of diligence and tenacity.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.170
They'll find it for sure.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.880
No matter what the situation.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.640
I-It's ringing!

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.810
But what if it's one of Tsukasa's men?

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.960
Yo.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.580
Senku!

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.030
I missed this all so much, I could cry.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.120
Including your ridiculously loud voice.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:52.530
Call from the Dead
