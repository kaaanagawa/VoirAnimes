WEBVTT

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.480
This is siege warfare.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.610
If we can buy even a little bit of time...

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.810
Yeah, but we don't have any 
chemicals or anything.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.570
How?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.050
Run, science user!

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.910
Yeah!

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.750
They'll be dying for nothing.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.160
I suppose they're just 
brain-dead primitives after all.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.680
This primitive stone world 
will be controlled...

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.490
...by the pure power given 
to humanity by nature.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.210
...by the science built by humanity itself.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.010
To Destroy and to Save

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.740
This is the final battle!

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.200
Defend the miracle cave!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.480
Don't tell me you're going to try to 
make some science-y weapon-y thing

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.680
while the fighting team is 
holding off Tsukasa-chan.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.620
Yeah.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.610
But they destroyed all our chemical stuff.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.800
We're legit out of everything.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.640
What are you doing?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.240
Over here, Chrome-chan!

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.270
He's probably got some ideas brewing.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.200
Let him be.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.710
You trust him so much.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.880
I saw something cross my eye.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.960
My intuition built over all 
these years is telling me...

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.670
There's got to be something science can 
offer me, somewhere on this battlefield!

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.320
My science begins with looking for materials!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.490
Surround them, but maintain 
a moderate distance.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.600
We don't stand a chance against 
Tsukasa and Hyoga in a head-on fight.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.850
Check out Tsukasa and Hyoga's tag-teaming!

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.570
Yeah, they're already 
invincible by themselves.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.640
He's vulnerable while he's in the air!

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.600
It's our last chance to defeat Tsukasa!

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.920
Taiju! Use this shock cannon!

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.380
Nikki!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.180
Everyone!

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.590
All right! Go!

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.110
Gross.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.610
You just want me to mix this snake poop 
or lizard poop or whatever this is?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.990
Nitric acid plus urea makes urea nitrate.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.960
It's not the best weapon, 
but it's better than nothing.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.050
I'm lost.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.590
If the uric acid in the 
feces isn't broken down...

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.300
That is, if it's good quality, 
we'll get white crystals.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.880
So you're saying, if we're lucky, 
we'll get a white powder weapon.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.970
Yeah.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.680
It's all down to luck.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.700
I forgot...

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.030
I said this before, 
but Senku-chan, you always...

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.400
have terrible luck.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.420
Not bad.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.170
I'd rather not kill you.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.190
He popped up from behind him.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.260
It's a cooperative move.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.930
Or so it would seem, 
but it's three-on-one.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.020
They're more proper than I expected.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.690
Not that Tsukasa-kun will have any trouble.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.630
I won't let you get in the way, Hyoga.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.690
You're up against me.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.290
Let's call it a revenge match.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.280
Magma...

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.030
Kinro... Ginro...

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.670
Everyone...

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.120
Isn't there anything else 
we can use besides poop?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.910
Y'know, like flowers or paper...

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.520
I have all kinds of tricks up my sleeve. 
I'm a magician, after all.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.980
If only we had sulfuric acid...

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.160
I don't think I'd have that.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.490
Why would I be carrying 
anything that dangerous?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.180
If I had sulfuric acid to mix with 
the miracle water, nitric acid,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.980
I could make a mixed acid.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.600
With mixed acid, I could...

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.580
No, there's no point in thinking 
about hypotheticals.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.130
I have some!

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.810
I have some sulfuric acid.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.140
Chrome-chan! Where did 
you find such a thing?!

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.870
Have you forgotten already?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.110
We launched it right at the beginning.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.580
It's the leftovers from the bluff tank cannon.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.860
Good job, king of materials!

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.290
We'll throw this in to top it off.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.730
It's chock full of glycerin.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.950
Soap?

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.670
It's been useful as hell 
from beginning to end.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.300
Come to think of it, it's one of the 
first science items I showed Tsukasa.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.630
It's our stone of life in a world with no doctors.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.100
It's our doctor stone.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.560
Our battle started with soap, 
and now it's going to end with soap.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.110
This is what I was after.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.970
Impale me.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.870
I still won't let go.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.470
Hyoga, without your spear, you're powerless.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.950
My spare.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.010
You can have that.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.210
Mediocre people are quick to resort to 
futile resistance when they despair.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.700
Hah! I don't remember ever despairing.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.470
Don't you get it?

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.270
All things build upon something else, 
whether it's might or science.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.560
We might be weak individually,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.800
but everything is made from the 
accumulation of all of our efforts.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.940
We make enough time for Senku and 
the science team to turn the tides.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:47.080
We believe in science—in Senku.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.710
What is this yellow liquid?

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.000
It smells sweet.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.430
Does your head hurt?

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.180
Shh! Don't breathe on it!

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.170
One little drop, and it'll go boom.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.640
We'll all be beyond dead meat.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.270
It's nitroglycerin.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.180
Nitro...

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.300
I've heard of that!

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.320
It's super dangerous, isn't it?

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.650
This stuff is <i>really</i> serious.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.320
Don't you dare try this at home, kids.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.290
No one's going to.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.410
You aren't going to blow them 
all up with this, are you?

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.370
No, idiot.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.010
I'm going to save everyone.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.390
The question is how to send this 
to the enemy without jostling it.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.480
You're not going!

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.560
Not to where Senku is!

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.670
This isn't a battle between 
might and science, Tsukasa.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.180
Might <i>is</i> science.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.810
Crease
diagonally

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.810
The best-flying paper airplane, 
confirmed by Guinness World Records.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.810
Both
sides

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.810
Fold to crease

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.810
Both
sides

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.810
Find center
point...

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.810
Fold!

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.810
Fold on top of that!

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.810
Fold

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.810
Both
sides!

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.810
Close it...

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.810
and fold
the wings!!

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.810
Tuck this
corner in...

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.810
by leaving just a little 
bit of the tip

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.530
It has about a hundred times 
the power of gunpowder.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.950
Do you know the ancient Greek word for "power"?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.830
It's "dynamite."

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.300
I can save everyone with this 
paper airplane dynamite.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.050
Wh-Wh-What was that?!

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.650
Anyone caught in that would 
be gone without a trace.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:20.040
Human strength is laughable in 
comparison to the power of science.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.830
We made it just in time.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.080
You held up well, battle team.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.350
The Kingdom of Science has 
just completed dynamite!

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.630
It has the power of ten 
billion megaton joules.

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.830
"Ten billion megatons," my ass, you liar.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.710
Shh!

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.180
Who cares about numbers?

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.530
You're not the best at negotiation.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.020
You only ever say the truth, jeez.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.000
Megaton?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.030
Dynamite? In this age?

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.120
They'll never be able to hit us 
with paper planes, though.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.870
Yeah.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.620
It's all-or-nothing!

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.140
We have dynamite arrows, too.
These are a little more

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.120
accurate than paper planes.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.600
Ukyo!

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.060
The tides have turned.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.510
The war is over.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.590
That's it! The end!

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.360
How magnificent.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.910
We won!

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.810
It's finally over!

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.170
Well, we may have won, 
but it's not over yet.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.320
We've dealt with the underlings.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.240
Now come the big problems.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.250
Tsukasa-chan and Senku-chan 
must have noticed...

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.400
What are you going to do now?

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.800
Whether I parry it or smack 
it down, it'll explode.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.870
There's no way to dodge a large blast.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.510
Yes. It's true that we're out of moves.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.270
But that would surely cause collateral 
damage and kill many people.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.930
Senku, you're incapable of abandoning people.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.470
You would never sacrifice yourself, either.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.700
Well, well, it looks like we're both stuck.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.700
This isn't a victory. It's a stalemate.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.210
And you deliberately created this situation.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.060
Which means, Senku, your objective is...

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.600
Yeah, to negotiate, Tsukasa.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:43.550
Gen, you said you first met 
Tsukasa on a TV special.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.510
Eh? Yeah, that's right.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.050
Don't you think that's a bit odd?

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.710
He could have had everything in the world,

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.900
yet he's pushing forward with the noble goal

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.060
of purifying established powers or whatever.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.070
That's the kind of man Shishio Tsukasa is.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.740
Yet this guy has been 
participating in a ton of fights

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.200
and showing up on TV all the time, 
making a ton of money.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.370
So much that he earned the nickname 
"strongest primate high schooler."

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.170
It just doesn't add up.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.540
That just doesn't seem like his style.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.300
That's true.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.240
Making a ton of money seemed 
like such an obvious thing to do

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.980
that I never even thought about it.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:30.090
What do you need all that money for?

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.720
For whom?

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.680
She's alive, isn't she, Tsukasa?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.680
Your sister, I mean.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.230
She is clinically brain-dead.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.580
There is no possibility that Mirai-chan 
will regain consciousness.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.610
I know.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.700
But still...

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.410
Strongest high schooler!?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.410
Shishio
Tsukasa

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.410
Special interview with "strongest primate high schooler" Shishio Tsukasa

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.100
The Little Mermaid

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.690
I'm back, Mirai.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.360
I'm going to protect you, okay?

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.210
No matter how many years or decades it takes.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.200
And someday, I swear...

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.710
We might be able to heal her.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.920
With the peripheral healing effect 
of reviving from petrification.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.600
It's all-or-nothing, but there's a chance.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.510
He's right, Tsukasa!

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.020
Even Senku's neck was 
healed after you broke it!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:30.020
So, as for that rejuvenation fluid...

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.460
Oh, look at that! We have all of it!

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.230
So scummy...

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.490
What a scummy face.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.050
What are your terms?

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.330
We're offering one chance 
to revive your sister.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.460
In exchange, we want a truce.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.460
What reason do I have to believe you?

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.400
All you have is my word.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.600
I don't lie when it comes to science.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.340
Is that not enough?

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.110
No, that's plenty.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.320
That's plenty.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.730
I never knew you had a sister.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.210
You'd been protecting her all that time.

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.350
Why would such a kind man 
decide to destroy statues?

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.010
That's really bad.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.120
"Really bad"...

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.490
I mean, you're not wrong.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.010
I like how blunt you are, Taiju-chan.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.090
Why did you decide to do something 
so horrible as purifying humanity?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.920
Horrible...

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.610
That it may be.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.070
What would you all have done?

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:48.330
If you were reborn in a stone world 
where there was almost no one else,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.050
and you learned that there was a revival fluid?

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.520
A primitive world can't sustain 
a large number of people.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.630
There's no guarantee that we can 
make unlimited revival fluid.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.720
Ukyo, who would you have chosen?

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.100
It's necessary to pick and choose lives.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.560
That's a terrifying thing to have to do.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.590
It's a sinful task, to have to play God.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.860
I decided to carry that sin,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.010
to make it an opportunity 
to build a new world.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.640
That's why.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.220
My goals haven't changed,

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.180
nor will they in the future.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.880
That's why, Senku, 
this is no more than a truce.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.390
That's fine.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:51.020
The hospital was around here.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.690
Everyone's been swept quite a distance away.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.980
We just need to dig them all up.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.920
We'll mine them out with dynamite.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.690
No, that's a bad idea!

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.770
You're going to destroy the statues!

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.800
No problem.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.990
It's only for the tough-ass bedrock.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.780
If we <i>do</i> blow up some statues, oh well!

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.030
We'll just have to glue 
them all back together.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.000
Um, who's going to be the 
one doing that hellish work?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.060
Please!

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:31.380
Whether Nobel invented dynamite 
for warfare or for engineering...

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.460
Which is it?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.320
Not my problem.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.150
Why do I care about what some 
old fart was feeling? Gross.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.860
All I can say is that he used

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.830
the money he made from the god 
of destruction that is dynamite

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.770
to hype up science with the Nobel Prize.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.830
And here we are, using 
the power of dynamite to...

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:02.030
dig, dig, and dig, and save lives.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.550
To save all of humanity.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.750
Mirai...

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.530
