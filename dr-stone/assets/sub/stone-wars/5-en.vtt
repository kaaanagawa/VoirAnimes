WEBVTT

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.520
Now we can go save Chrome!

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.030
It's a living iron creature 
built from nothing.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.030


00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.030
Steam engine
acquired!!

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.310
Out of the way!

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.580
It'll run you over!

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.540
Seriously, you'll get hurt real bad!
Everyone, stay away!

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.420
"Hurt real bad," my ass!

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.690
All this thing ever does is run.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.720
It's no match for my number one power!

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.260
Look out!

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.560
Magma and the iron steam engine 
creature are going to duke it out.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.120
This'll be interesting.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.280
You don't scare me!

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.540
Magma!

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.340
What are you, mental?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.380
Why would you think you 
could stop a steam engine?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.780
It's like a living creature.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.230
Yeah. A creature with incredible strength.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.250
It's like a gorilla!

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.850
Yeah, even more like one than Kohaku-chan!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.250
Isn't this Chrome's role?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.720
Come back home, Chrome.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.820
Now we can all go help Chrome.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:32.440
Yeah.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.200
Once the engine's done, the rest 
of the car won't be hard to build.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
It's the power beast of science: Steam Gorilla.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.450
Well, then...

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.340
This village has been great to me.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.510
But it's goodbye for now.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.510
Senku...

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.060
We don't have time to be getting sentimental.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.380
We're throwing all our science gear on board

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.270
and heading to the 
Tsukasa Empire, one and all!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.200
This is exhilarating.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.810
Let me go, you...

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.470
That hurt, you bastard!

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.630
What, do you really think you can 
trust this wimpy bamboo cage?

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.560
Don't go crying about it later!

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.670
Tsukasa-kun, why are we keeping 
him here, so out in the open?

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.970
I-It's so shaky!

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.240
It's going to collapse!

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.710
All our cargo's going to fall apart!

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.930
O-O-Oh, God!

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.370
Wh-Wh-Why am I the test driver?

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.240
You're the only one who 
has a driver's license.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.390
Driver's license?! In this world?!

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.180
Gotta obey traffic laws.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.890
You're surprisingly upright, huh?

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.040
I didn't think that for one millisecond.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.220
Which is it?!

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.870
I don't think wooden wheels are 
going to hold up, are they?

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.660
We aren't driving on paved roads.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.120
What are we doing for tires?

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.080
Don't worry!

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.660
We're all working hard!

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.520
We're doing hexagonal bamboo weaves!

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.630
Bamboo?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.330
What is this?

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
Yeah, they're the airless tires developed 
by NASA for planetary exploration.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.380
And they're made from bamboo weave.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:43.140
You say that like we should all have 
heard of them, but I had no idea.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.930
And there we have it!

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.220
It's done!

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.220
The Steam Gorilla!

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.830


00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.830
Automobile
acquired!!

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.330
I'm confused, but it looks so cool!

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.560
Yeah, I'm confused, but it does look cool.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.220
Sure, it's amazing, and I'm impressed too, 
but what's with their enthusiasm?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.930
You can't blame them.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.220
Not when it comes to making machines.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.100
Old Man Kaseki seems really sad.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.580
We need to hurry up and go free Chrome.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.400
I can't help but feel sorry for him.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.580
Tsukasa needs him as a hostage,

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.640
but it's hard to say how 
he might be treating him.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.150
No, I don't mean that.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.000
He's not here to help us 
build our awesome automobile.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.900
That's why I feel sorry for him!

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.480
It's so sad, the entirety of the 
United States is going to weep.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.810
We need to hurry up and go 
flex the Steam Gorilla at him.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.750
The science team is pretty awful, huh?

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.240
I suppose that's just what 
good friends they are.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.410
We're ready to move out whenever!

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.860
We're moving out en masse to rescue Chrome!

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.410
All right.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.410
Load up the science tools and the pesky 
old farts who can't walk fast enough.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.460
Senku, I don't think we can go.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.020
We've thought about it.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:39.140
Even with all the science equipment, 
we could have just made multiple trips.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.310
So why did you build this 
so-called "automobile"?

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.350
You built it for those of us who 
can't walk long distances.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.920
We already know, Senku.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.530
I don't care about that.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.260
I just like making sciencey things.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.640
We'll stay behind in Ishigami Village.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.220
We don't want to get in your 
way while you're in battle.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.100
You'll be able to bring more 
science tools with you that way.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.390
But that's too dangerous.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.750
Yeah. What if Tsukasa-kun's 
army sends reinforcements?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.770
You won't stand a chance.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.080
We must all go together.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.020
You can't stay behind!

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.920
Thank you, everyone.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.780
But we aren't the least 
bit worried about that.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.890
Because...

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:53.300
Because you will defeat 
the Tsukasa Empire first.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.540
Isn't that right?

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.120
Yeah. Of course we will.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.200
We'll fight together and return here.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.930
Along with the victory flag 
for the Kingdom of Science.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.240
Lucky.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.270
I wish I could drive, too.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.960
The Steam Gorilla's holding up really well.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.450
As long as we're on level ground.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.820
It's a bit of a roundabout route,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.700
but I've done several trips already, 
so I know where all the flat roads are.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.220
But even so...

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.630
It can't go up hills?!

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.420
We'll have to push it together!

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:25.600
The way the wobbler engine works, 
it needs some momentum to keep turning.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:32.770
Pushes
with
pump

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:32.770
Returns
on
momentum

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.040
We would have had more power if we'd 
built a double-cylinder engine.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.770
Trying to save time backfired on us.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.650
More power?

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.340
All right.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.380
There's more of a climb up ahead.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.000
S-Senku...

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.970
He's got a really evil grin.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.560
You can tell from his face 
that he's up to something.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.840
We're setting up camp beneath a cliff.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.730
It's simplistic, but it's guerrilla warfare.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.960
Put all our manufacturing at the bottom.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.690
We'll hide as much of the smog 
behind the trees as we can.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.030
First, we need to figure out 
where Chrome's being held.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.240
Until then, there's nothing we can do.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.450
But where do I begin?

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.280
Suika?!

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.460
Now's the time for Great Detective 
Suika to make herself useful!

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.450
It's no use...

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.060
I can't find him anywhere.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.120
Damn it!

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:17.700
I'm so bored, cooped up in this 
prison of cave and bamboo!

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.170
What is he shouting about all of a sudden?

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.000
Chrome!

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.180
He's safe and well!

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.330
You put yourself in serious danger!

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.820
But well done, Suika.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.230
They had so many guards, though.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.720
We'll just charge in and murder them all!

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.320
That's the worst thing to do.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.880
I don't know about murdering them,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.950
but charging in might not 
be a bad idea this time.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.690
Ch-Ch-Charge in?!

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.780
I don't mind, as long as 
I'm not the one doing it.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.210
But that's crazy!

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.610
We're going to bust down 
the bamboo prison by force.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.220
We've got a mech on our side.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.720
The monster of science 
that is the Steam Gorilla.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.970
We're going to give it an insane 
upgrade and turn it into a tank.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.790
We're modding my adorable little Steam 
Gorilla, after all the work we put into it?!

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.890
"Adorable"?

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.300
Adorable isn't the right word.

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:24.610
It isn't <i>adorable</i>.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.960
It's not adorable.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.120
It's not adorable.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.370
No, we're giving it a power-up.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.620
Oh, really?

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.130
Then let's upgrade it!

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.600
Now! Now!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.040
But Senku, how could we make it any better?

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.750
We're going to armor it like crazy

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.470
so it becomes a tank that we 
can ram through the enemy.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.480
In iron all around?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.900
How could it even move? 
It would be too damn heavy.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.230
We need speed in order to use it as a ram.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.950
Of course.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.360
So what are we making the tank with?

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.530
Paper.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.620
Hair?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.680
Gods?

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.170
I get it!

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.540
A paper tank.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.790
That would be nice and light.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.760
What?!

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.990
We got a ton of weeds!

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.730
Does it really not matter 
what kind of weeds they are?

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.960
Just about anything works.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.940
We're going to boil all this grass 
in sodium hydroxide to loosen it up.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.380
Mecha Senku here!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.610
If you're going to try this at home, 
try using bleach or baking soda!

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:53.330
We take that boiled goo, wash it, 
press it, and dry it.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.140
It actually looks legit!

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.680
I never knew paper was so easy to make.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:08.470


00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:08.470
Paper
acquired!!

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.190
This'll make it much easier 
to draw blueprints and stuff.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.300
We wasted a lot of leather up until now.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:07.560
What is that for?

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.470
Knows the value
of paper

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.470
Doesn't know the value of paper

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.040
What use is this flimsy stuff?

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.230
I hope you aren't going to suggest we make 
a car with this feeble material, Senku.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.230
Yeah, that's what I'm suggesting.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.250
Wait, you aren't just making 
a paper wall, are you?

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.450
Bingo. Ten billion points for you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.620
Lastly, we iron it out, and...

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.730
We have a paper shield.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.630


00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.630
Paper shield
acquired!!

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:49.800
Okay, now we glue these paper 
shields all over the sides

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.660
and turn the Steam Gorilla into a tank.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.010
Senku.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.010
You may not know...

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.920
But a blow from a spearman can 
bring down even a wooden shield.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:17.240
I have a hard time believing in 
your so-called paper shield.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.400
I think so, too!

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.460
Oh?

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.870
That'll be the perfect test, then.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.380
Wanna fight?

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.370
This is bad!

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.520
Senku and Kinro are in battle!

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.880
What?!

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.260
What is going on?

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.080
Man, and that spear Senku-chan asked for...

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.290
It's not for competitions, is it?

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.370
It's the real deal.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.980
This is dangerous, Senku.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.200
I can't—

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.270
It wouldn't be a test if you 
didn't attack at full strength.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.780
That's the rule.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.660
According to you, the rules 
are the rules, aren't they?

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.190
All right.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.120
Then I won't hold back whatsoever.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.250
Senku!

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.230
Senku won!

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.200
Kinro's spear fell apart.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.790
The paper shield hasn't so much as dented!

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.280
With a paper wall? How?

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:33.990
No, wait.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.020
I don't think he'll be able to 
answer any questions for a while.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.930
He's gone numb.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.750
He stopped the blade, 
but he still took the impact.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:52.480
That wasn't just glue you were 
painting onto the paper, was it?

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.470
Bingo. Ten billion points for you.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.920
I painted molten plastic onto it.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.630
Combine the flexibility of paper 
with the rigidity of plastic, and...

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.770
We have carbon resin.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.770
Plastic

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:15.510
Carbon Fiber
(Fiber-fortified plastic)

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:15.510
Fiber

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.490
Carbon fiber?!

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.900
I think I might have heard of it...

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.110
It's stupid light and stupid tough.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.080
It's used in F1 car bodies and rockets.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.990
It's the ultimate construction material, 
with SS agility and SS defense.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.240
Check out the Steam Gorilla!

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.160
It's ridiculously powered up!

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.420
It's starting to look really tough.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.160
We made it a double steam 
engine, front-wheel drive,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.230
with insanely huge caterpillar-ish wheels.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.270
We can do it,

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.090
so long as we have this tank 
fortified with the ultimate material!

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.240
We could potentially ram into 
the prison and destroy it,

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.080
saving Chrome without causing 
any bloodshed at all!

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.630
I'm sure Suika told the others 
where I'm being held, but...

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.440
Gotta go pee.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.980
No, idiot! Don't go over there!

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.690
Shit!

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:24.820
This is...

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.810
A trap?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:32.980
Coal is easy to obtain, as long 
as you don't care about quality.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.370
The next science we need to 
be wary of, after gunpowder,

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.870
is a frontal assault using a steam engine.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.900
A steam engine?

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.770
In this stone world?

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.940
Sooner or later, they'll get there.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.960
Senku would do it.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:59.720
Is that why you imprisoned him somewhere 
so easy to attack by vehicle?

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.630
I see.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.220
Chrome-kun is bait.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:12.350
Senku puts on a cold act, 
but he won't abandon his friends.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.360
That's his fatal weakness.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.960
Hey, hey, do you think...

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.670
Once we rescue Chrome,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.370
we could use the Steam Gorilla tank

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.080
to wreck Tsukasa's army?

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.960
Then we might not even have to fight!

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.720
<i>If</i> it's still working after 
we slam into the prison.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.370
It's a one-time-use build, 
only meant for saving Chrome.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.340
Really?!

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.530
It's a one-shot surprise attack mech.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.750
If they figure us out and take measures 
against a vehicular assault, it's over.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.940
Here, there...

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.000
Anti-vehicle traps everywhere!

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:07.150
So they're all screwed if they come 
here hoping to save this idiot!

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.180
No! It's a trap, Senku!

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.210
Don't come to rescue me!

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.120
I have to let them all know.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.980
Someone...

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.000
Damn, what am I saying?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.380
Come rescue me?

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.510
What am I, a kid crying 
for his mommy and daddy?

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.180
Hell no!

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.430
I'm going to save

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.590
Senku and the others.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.770
It'd be such a waste to only use it once, though.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.240
If we spent some time mounting a turret on it,

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.940
we could use it to take over 
the miracle cave or something.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.550
Quit talking in hypotheticals.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:51.950
It's a waste of time.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:00.340
But if Chrome were to escape on his 
own, things would be quite different.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.160
I'm going to escape on my own,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.570
using the power of science!

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.750
That's right. I'm Chrome, the science user.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.950
