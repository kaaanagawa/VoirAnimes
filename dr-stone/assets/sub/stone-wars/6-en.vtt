WEBVTT

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.520
Well, time to begin our 
mission to save Chrome.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.060
The mission objectives are simple.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.900
First, we break down Chrome's bamboo 
prison with the powered-up Steam Gorilla.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.780
Then we run.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.990
That is all.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.510
It's so simple.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.970
Well, if they found out, 
it'd give them a chance to prepare.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.390
The Steam Gorilla's a 
one-time-use disposable.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.620
Senku-chan has no trouble letting go of things.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.020
We can't trash our adorable Steam Gorilla!

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.470
We don't have much time, though.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.970
This is Chrome we're talking about. 
At some point, he's going to run his mouth.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.480
I'm a science user!

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.410
Colorful flames!

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.730
Running his mouth
like hell...

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.760
We may already be too late.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.700
Yeah, I bet.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.270
Let's get ready to set out immediately.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.620
Yeah!

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.250
Senku would never abandon one of his own.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.130
He'll undoubtedly use weapons 
of science to save Chrome.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.960
For example, a bombardment by steam engine.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.470
That's why we need your strength.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010
My strength?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.670
I know about you. I interviewed you before.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.620
You won in the baton category at 
the police martial arts competition.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.560
You're a crazy-strong, crazy police officer.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.340
Mm.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.200
Could I ask you to manage the prison 
and the traps in its vicinity, Yo?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.610
Piece of cake, yo.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.160
Woo! Leave it to me, Yo-kun.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.880
I'll use the prisoner as bait to take down 
Senku and all of his baddie buddies!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.130
Yay.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.050
I'm going to escape on my own before 
Senku and the others come to help me,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.290
with science user Chrome's 
awesome science power.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.110
How am I supposed to break out, though?

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.200
All my science stuff got 
taken away when I got caught.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.040
The walls and ground are 
too hard to dig through.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.210
What if I spend several days

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.600
grinding down the rope that 
holds the bamboo bars together?

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.690
No, that's never going to work.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.170
What would Senku do in this situation?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.760
I need to calculate a way to escape.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.290
Damn it!

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.850
Of course not.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.740
I can't just imitate Senku.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.940
And boom!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.560
What do you expect?

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.460
What do you want me to do?

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.310
You ruined one of the pit traps.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.120
No pleading innocence.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.550
Okay, all done.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.100
We're good now.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.300
S-Sorry, Yo-kun.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.750
Spare me the apologies. We're good now.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.420
In fact, if anyone gives you any 
more trouble, I'll make them pay.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.610
This new world's nice and simple.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.420
Thank you, sir, for helping 
us wipe our slate clean.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.940
Oh, sure.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.160
I'm not going to the slammer 
just for evading taxes.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.260
These are for you.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.480
These are tasty-looking steamed buns indeed.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.740
Let me pour you a drink.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.280
Thank you.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.840
And boom!

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.750
What?!

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.090
I found the baddies!

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.280
Arrest them!

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.550
Bastards!

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.140
And boom!

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.720
Boom!

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.600
A criminal ran away.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.260
So I shot him.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.450
Did I do something wrong?

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.210
A trial? That's a pain in the ass.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.550
He's a bad guy. Just kill him.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.130
Boom!

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.880
Central Police Station

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.800
You're fired!

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.900
I had no future in the old world.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.630
Hooray for the reset, y'know?

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.970
Is he the prison boss type?

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.060
This seems kinda bad.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.350
I don't think I can get 
anything done in front of him.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.710
I could make it to the 
top in this stone world.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.900
You know how the three people

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.750
at the pinnacle of humanity right now 
are Tsukasa, Hyoga, and Ukyo, right?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.920
Wrong!

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.700
It's the four emperors, myself included.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.790
So I gotta put on a good 
show and take my throne.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.660
Once I'm at the top...

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.240
To that end, I'm going to use that captive 
primitive to lure... Senku, was it?

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.970
Boom! Right into a pit trap 
with all of his buddies.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.600
I'm going to make this work 
if it's the last thing I do.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.770
Are you sure?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.690
Huh?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.980
I mean, I'm pretty sure he heard your plan.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.650
Who cares?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.840
He can't contact his friends or anything.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.370
Don't sweat it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.790
Besides, he's just a primitive.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.320
Who are you calling a 
flimsy, dumbass primitive?!

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.950
Huh? I never said all that, did I?

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.880
I'm going to make you regret it!

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.590
Damn it!

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.620
I may be a primitive from their perspective,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.390
but just watch me make 
my escape with science!

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.380
There's no point in mulling 
it over forever in my head.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.030
I'm not as good as Senku.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.270
First, I need to gather materials.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.700
That's what I'm best at.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.800
Less thinking, more action.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.830
Search.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.200
That's where my science begins.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.050
What's up, man?

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.960
Are you that interested in 
seeing me take a dump?

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.770
Shut up!

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.280
Go get it done already!

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.000
All right, this is my loot.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.410
Do I have anything I can 
use to make an escape?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.980
Dead shepherd's
purse               

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.490
 Dandelions 

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.690 position:20% line:20%
Sorrel

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.690
Dried branches

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.690

Yes! I found it!

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.950
A four-leaf clover!

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.440
I hunted these things like crazy with Ruri.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.000
Good times!

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.340
Wait, no!

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.790
How am I supposed to escape 
with just grasses and twigs?!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:08:59.920
Twigs...

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.600
It'll work.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.470
If I can set fire to the ropes 
binding the bamboo together...

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.790
I can do this!

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.430
I can't do it.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.360
There's no way I'm starting 
a fire with these branches.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.500
Fire...

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.240
Damn it!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.120
If only I had a battery...

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.690
They took it away when they searched me.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.430
Zzz...

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.850
Zzz...

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.630
Zzz...

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.810
Holy crap!

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.280
How do I have a battery?

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.390
I get it!

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.720
It's from those two, Taiju and Yuzuriha!

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.790
Thank you for sneaking this in for me!

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.630
Let's get started, then.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.300
I have to escape during the night.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.060
Hook the positive and negative 
of the battery together...

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.790
I saw a spark!

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.720
It's a fire!

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.240
I smell a match!

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.850
And what was that sound?!

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.950
Yo, primitive.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.870
Did you really think we 
wouldn't notice a fire?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.660
How did you even light it?

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.780
I-I'm not telling you!

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.150
Don't underestimate a science user!

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.880
Damn it, he's going to find out.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.520
He's going to find my battery!

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.760
Ah, you found some twigs 
and rubbed them together.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.130
Thanks for your hard work, man.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.480
I'm saved.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.720
I was lucky I had this stuff with me.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.000
Hang on, sorry.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:16.230
Is this what you mean when you call 
yourself a science user, Primitive-kun?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.950
No, I shouldn't laugh at 
developing peoples like that.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.300
Sorry. Really.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.470
Did you know?

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.620
When you rub wood together, 
it gets really hot.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.800
Rub, rub, rub... Kapoof!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.920
Well?! That's the power of science!

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.750
Don't underestimate a science user!

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:43.440
Hrmph!

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.970
Crap, I can't stop laughing! Sorry...

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.460
You're too funny, Primitive-kun.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.970
To hell with that!

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.810
I used metal! A battery!

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.330
I'm way more advanced than you...

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.340
No.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.830
Science isn't for bragging.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.970
Remember my goal.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.290
In fact, I should pretend to be low-level.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.050
Fine! I'll show you some insane science!

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.310
Don't wet yourselves!

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.560
Did you know you can boil 
seawater to get salt?!

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.840
I bet you didn't!

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.240
That's amazing, science user Chrome-kun!

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.250
Sorry. Good luck.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.310
I'm looking forward to your 
seawater prison escape.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.820
Oh, man!

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.800
Seawater prison escape?

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.160
Separate the salt water using electricity...

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.200
We have sodium hydroxide!

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.970
The yakuza use it to melt corpses.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.110
I might be able to melt it 
down with sodium hydroxide.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.670
Those ropes shouldn't be that tough.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.920
I have electricity.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.370
All I need now is salt water.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:10.310
Senku used seawater, but I won't 
be getting any of that in prison.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.970
Then there's only one way to make salt water!

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.730
What the hell?

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.240
Leave him be.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.400
I can do it by myself.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.190
How's that?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.960
I'm breaking down the cell using 
a chemically decomposed liquid.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.350
This is the jailbreak of 
Chrome the science user!

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600
Oh, shit!

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.440
There's a bear in the prison!

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.450
There can't be a bear in the prison.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.010
This is the BSing skill I learned from Gen!

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.030
This is the moment I've been waiting for!

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.450
The one second I needed

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.000
to escape here!

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.460
I pole vault all the time when 
I'm out scavenging for materials.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.360
That primitive knows where all the traps are!

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.650
Yo-kun!

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.870
Utterly Destroyed

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.320
Wait, why?!

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.790
How did you break through the bars?

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.690
And all of them at once!

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.270
I-It's melted!

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.370
Some kind of science?

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.050
By that primitive who was bragging 
about rubbing wood together?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.150
Damn it!

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.230
Stop!

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.800
You must be having a hard time chasing me.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.500
Especially after you saw Yo beat the snot 
out of a guy who broke one of the traps.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.930
That's what you get for talking 
shit about other people's mistakes.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.090
He's taking advantage of the smoke.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.660
I swiped that off of Ukyo.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.150
Use the enemy's traps against them!

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.120
Damn it, of course you'd be the 
one who's still coming after me,

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:20.120
Yo!

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.210
He's so fast!

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.450
Damn primitive!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.510
I need to make it to the top of this world!

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.770
And to that end, 
I need you no matter what, Chrome!

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.200
Shit!

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.940
Dead end!

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.110
Damn it, I have to fight!

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.760
Boom!

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.140
Yo, you're a total moron, aren't you?

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.240
How did you think a primitive 
with a bamboo pole

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.540
could put up a fight against a 
policeman with modern training?

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.710
Take your pick.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.450
Do you want to get the crap beaten out 
of you and be sent back to prison,

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.440
or do you want to get the life beaten 
out of you and be sent back to prison?

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.170
No pleading innocence.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.970
But we can call it even.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:28.330
It doesn't make any difference to me.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:33.940
Either way, I've only got 
a few days left to live.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.250
What the hell are you doing?

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.260
That's not the amount of blood you'd 
lose from a cut in your mouth!

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.380
He's vomiting blood!

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:56.330
I caught it in the village.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.910
I didn't tell anyone.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.740
I didn't want to worry them.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.810
It's too late for me, though.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.820
Pneumonia.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:14.190
For you scienceless bastards, 
it's a deadly contagious disease.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.000
Hey! No! Stop!

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.300
Chrome, you asshole!

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.040
Damn it!

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:33.130
I have just one move that 
I mastered in combat.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.340
Here it is!

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.050
Impossible!

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.660
Chrome's come home!

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.090
You escaped by yourself?!

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.920
Not bad!

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.250
I'm impressed you figured 
out where our camp was.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.680
Who the hell could figure that out?

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.940
I just went in the direction 
Suika went after she scouted,

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.920
and I chose a route that might 
be visible through a telescope.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.080
Good job, Great Detective Suika-chan.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.820
But Chrome-chan, how did you 
break through the bamboo bars?

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.610
Oh, check out my awesome science!

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:46.140
I made that melty chemical 
using salt water and a battery.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.960
Sodium hydroxide, was it?

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.160
Wow!

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.210
Sodium hydrochlorite.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.760
That's what you actually made, Chrome.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.870
If you don't have a membrane in the 
salt water, you discover bleach instead.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:07.560
Kitchen Cleaner

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:07.560
Do not mix. Danger

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.050
Speeds up all your cleaning!

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.560
It's a perfectly useful base.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.940
Nothing wrong with using that

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.560
to melt down the cellulose in 
the weeds used to make rope.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.760
That's a great way to escape 
from a bamboo prison.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.940
Well done. Ten billion points for you.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:26.440
Wait, wasn't sodium hydroxide...

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.490
Yeah, meanwhile, we were using

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.920
an alkaline solution to melt down 
cellulose for making paper.

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.770
So Senku and Chrome happened to
come up with the same science.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.360
Hey, Chrome...

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.360
Why are you bleeding?

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.010
This is what happened when I was ill!

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.480
Chrome has pneumonia!

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.710
No...

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.480
Chrome!

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.910
Kidding!

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.120
What's going on, Chrome?

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.790
You have plants, too?

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.250
I've been trying them on my own body 
and collecting the ones that were good.


00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.310
You used <i>this</i> to fool your pursuers?

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.380
Yeah. I knew Senku-sensei would get it.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.050 position:20% line:20%
Sorrel

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.740
Chew up sorrel

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.050
Dried Shiso

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.020
Red shiso + sorrel (oxalic acid)

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.020
and shiso together...

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.440
Red

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:35.440
water

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.350
And it turns into red water!

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.370
That's awesome!

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.220
Of course shiso will turn red if you mix 
it with the oxalic acid from sorrel.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.890
Yeah!

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.070
My science is built on experience.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.240
Not bad, science user Chrome.

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.480
Chrome doesn't really have pneumonia!

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.520
This red water looks familiar.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.090
It's the stuff you get when 
you pickle plums in shiso...

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.900
It's just umeboshi!

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.880
Damn it!

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.490
