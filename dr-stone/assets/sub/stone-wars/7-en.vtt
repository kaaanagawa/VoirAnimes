WEBVTT

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.480
How's that?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.220
I'm breaking down the cell using 
a chemically decomposed liquid.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.960
This is the jailbreak of 
Chrome the science user!

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.670
Impossible!

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.780
Chrome's come home!

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.120
You escaped by yourself?!

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.850
Not bad!

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.590
Science is awesome!

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.990
You used it to escape prison!

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.780
I'm impressed you managed 
to keep your science tools.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.900
I thought they would've taken 
them when they captured you.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.320
About that...

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.780
Taiju helped me out.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.910
He gave me a battery!

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.090
I'm ten billion percent sure

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.220
there's no way that meathead 
could have thought to do that.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.500
Was it Yuzuriha, then?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.800
She'd be the only one left.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.900
But Yuzuriha is busy as hell
on her secret mission.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.640
She's not the kind of woman who would 
ditch her duties to do other things.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.550
Yuzuriha's mission?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.470
Wasn't she only infiltrating the enemy

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.060
so she could keep in contact 
using the cell phone?

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.320
Well, what does it matter? 
Someone saved me!

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.320
What the heck is this 
ridiculous gorilla machine?!

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.400
Now we don't have to trash 
our adorable Steam Gorilla!

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.270
Yeah.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.290
Having the Steam Gorilla to storm the enemy 
at the site of the final battle is huge.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.070
The site...

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.090
...of the final battle?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470
The battle will be to 
capture the miracle cave.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.350
If we have access to the nitric 
acid brewing in the cave,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.770
we can make revival fluid, 
and we can make gunpowder.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.060
So if we capture the cave...

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.770
The Tsukasa Empire won't be 
able to gain any more men!

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.730
And we get the ultimate weapons of science!

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.850
In the battle between the Kingdom 
of Science and the Tsukasa Empire,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.230
the victory condition isn't 
the enemy's annihilation.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.000
The winner is the one who 
captures the miracle cave.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.720
Tsukasa is going to bring all 
of his forces against us.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.850
We can pull it off, so long as we 
have Senku's sorcer—science weapons.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.600
They have around a hundred people, though.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.980
We only have a dozen or so fighters.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.720
We're way outnumbered.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.140
That's why Taiju and the others 
are working so hard right now.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.480
The rest is up to the mentalist's big mouth.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.760
We're going to bring them all to our side.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.700
So much responsibility...

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.700
Oh, right.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.430
Are you sure about that impersonation tactic?

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.800
Thanks to megafan Nikki-chan's 
brutal instruction,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.350 line:20%
No! Not even close! Lillian's more 
this way and that way and all that!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.880
I can reproduce Lillian-chan's 
voice perfectly.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.500 line:20%
How many times do I have to tell you?!

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.980
As long as Ukyo-chan doesn't 
hear it with his crazy hearing.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.740
I need to be careful not to let him find out.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.550
Screw the rope.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.220
Chrome-kun was scouting out 
the miracle cave by himself.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980
He must be after the nitric acid.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.460
All right. Let's get started.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.730
It's the start of our last 
mission before we make our

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.280
preemptive attack against the Tsukasa Empire.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.960
Secret Mission

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.600
My adorable Steam Gorilla is 
becoming even more adorable!

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.670
It's Lillian Weinberg!

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.460
It's her!

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.090
Hi! I'm Lillian Weinberg!

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.630
It's Lillian!

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.230
Hi, y'all! People of Japan... 
Are you listening?

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.700 line:20%
Listen up, people of Japan.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.210
The training paid off.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.950
He even got her subtle Southern accent.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.880
Full points, Gen.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.160
I'm in love.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.310
The US has already restored civilization.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.220
Everyone will be saved.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.130
We're going to be saved!

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.500
Yes!

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.170
Wow.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.530
Keep it down, everyone.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.760
Remember, Tsukasa is rejecting 
the powers of the past world.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.090
Do you honestly think he's going 
to play nice with the US military?

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.390
How is he going to reject anything?

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.480
Yeah!

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.950
The US is back!

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.480
As strong as Tsukasa might be, 
if they come with guns, it's over.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.320
That's correct.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.240
But it's going to be a while before we, 
the US military, get there.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.210
We'd like to put an end to Tsukasa-kun's 
destruction of the stone statues.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.920
Until then, please cooperate 
with Senku-kun's plans.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.040
This is amazing! The plan to use Lillian's 
voice is bringing in so many people!

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.580
Yeah.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.110
It's a little scary how well it's going.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.100
People are always in the most danger

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.670
when they get too used to 
something and become complacent.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.940
You look like you're having fun.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.430
I'd like to hear that phone call, too.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.020
Oh, no!

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.130
We can't let Ukyo hear her!

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.210
We don't have a choice anymore, though.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.560
You're right.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.550
My impersonation, trained by megafan 
Nikki-sensei, versus Ukyo-chan's hearing.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.650
It's a sudden-death duel!

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.490
Who am I talking to now?

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.860
This is Lillian Weinberg.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.270
Wow.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.300
It really is Lillian.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.830
I would have lost, normally.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.610
However, there's no vibration in your voice after singing so enthusiastically,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.190
which is hard for you to imitate,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.260
Gen.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.610
Damn it! Not after we've come so far!

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.640
I messed up!

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.720
Just a second, Senku-chan.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.770
Why did Ukyo-chan just 
say all that in English?

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.650
It's because he didn't want 
the others to listen in, right?

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.410
I've had my suspicions about 
Ukyo-chan's odd behaviors.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.370
When he found us at the grave site,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.670
he chased after us by himself without 
telling Tsukasa-chan or anyone else.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.550
Good observation, mentalist.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.630
The Gen versus Ukyo battle 
is at one to one so far.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.750 line:20%
The person who slipped Chrome that battery...

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.360
You were the one who gave Chrome 
that battery, weren't you, Ukyo?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.780
I'm amazed.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.100
You sure do catch on quickly.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.480
If you'd come to help Chrome, 
Senku, you'd be dead.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.800
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.240
I'm not on your side.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.030
I'm sure of that.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:04.370
If you were, you never would have 
captured Chrome to begin with.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.080
I'm trying to figure things out, too.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.170
I want to hear from you 
what kind of people you are.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:17.790
I saw your unbelievable secret mission.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.940
I'm going to go make clothes.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.140
All right.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.140
I heard rattling in that bag...

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.100
Fragments of rock.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.070
A lot of them.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.750
What would she be using 
them for if she's sewing?

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.750
Ba-ba-bam!

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.590
There, done.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.740
She's that fast?

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.590
Everyone thinks she spends all night sewing.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.690
If that's a ruse, what is she 
doing with the rest of her time?

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.730
Today's is even more work than usual.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.590
But that's okay.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.450
I'm used to this kind of thing.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.080
Wait... Those rocks...

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.660
The surfaces of the statues are weathered.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.330
They won't revert to living cells.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:39.090
That's why you break through 
thin rocks when you're revived.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.030
In other words, even for the 
statues that Tsukasa's destroyed,

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:48.620
if they're reassembled before they 
have time to weather, just maybe...

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.560
It's hard to believe, but if I'm right...

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.310
This is madness.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:38.570
Even in this situation, you people 
are trying to save all of humanity.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.310
With the power of science.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.540
I'm sorry!

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.250
That primitive melted through the rope!

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.790
We don't know how he did it.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.310
Don't worry about what happened with Chrome.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.560
It couldn't be helped.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.480
By the way, what happened to Yo?

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.970
W-Well...

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.520
I'm done for!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.250
I let Chrome get away! I'm screwed!

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.870
This is my last instruction. 
Listen carefully.

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.280
A subordinate does exactly 
as their superior says.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.490
In exchange, all responsibility 
lies with your superior, right?

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.570
That means me.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.800
Lay all the blame for Chrome's escape on me.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.970
Tell them, "Yo-kun fell into 
the waterfall and died."

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.510
I'm outta here!

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.130
Time to reset my life again!

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.720
Later!

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.700
We might be able to save everyone,

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.900
including the people who've 
been destroyed by Tsukasa,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.200
if we put them back together like 3D puzzles.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.160
You nailed it. Ten billion 
points for you, Ukyo.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.750
And, what?

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.960
Are you going to rat me 
out to Tsukasa-sensei?

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.960
No.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.200
Senku, I wouldn't mind cooperating with you.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.470
On one condition.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.740
It'd be really great if we could 
get the help of Ukyo-chan

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.100
and his super hearing, but...

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.250
A condition, huh?

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:44.130
Want me to take over, Senku-chan?

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.510
Negotiation is a mentalist's job.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.730
I don't have time to beat around the bush.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.100
Get to the point.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.790
What's your condition?

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.120
That's the worst thing you 
can do in a negotiation!

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.420
Okay, fine.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.830
My condition is simple.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.350
No one can die.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.720
I can never quite figure you out, Ukyo.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.760
You're either a lovey-dovey idealist, or...

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.060
An idealist?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.820
I'm the biggest coward there is.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.740
You're...

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.970
Shishio Tsukasa.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.300
Nice to meet you.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.950
This former journalist told me all about you.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.380
Former submarine sonar 
operator, Saionji Ukyo-kun.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:46.170
You were known for your exceptional 
hearing and rational decision-making.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:56.430
Ukyo, I need your help in order 
to build a beautiful stone world.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.310
The first time I saw Tsukasa destroy 
a statue, I was nothing but sad.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.550
I thought, "Why? How could you?"

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:14.600
Still, I wanted to keep the 
revived from killing each other.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.620
To that end, I turned a blind eye 
to Tsukasa's statue destruction.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.350
The statues are currently inanimate objects.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.840
To not revive them doesn't constitute murder.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:28.920
Or so I convinced myself, 
with paper-thin reasoning.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.300
I know I'm a helpless coward.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.720
But I just can't bear

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:46.610
to see anyone else die.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:53.890
Isn't that the last bastion of 
our humanity in this damn world?

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.180
If you promise to produce zero 
casualties, I'll cooperate with you.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.240
But if you kill even one person...

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.350
Sounds great. I'm in.

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.750
No problem.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.160
We've said we'd try to make it a 
bloodless siege from the beginning.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.920
All that's changed is that it's a 
requirement instead of an ideal.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.620
That's gonna be a pretty tough battle!

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.140
Thank you.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.350
There's one thing I'm certain of now.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.280
When Hyoga attacked your 
village, he said this:

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.660
"Our men died because of 
Senku's machinations."

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.540
That's wrong.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.050
You weren't the one who did it.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.790
It was Hyoga.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:48.090
Tsukasa and Hyoga are both at the top, 
but they are totally different creatures.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.050
I can't sit on the fence any longer.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.760
There's going to be bloodshed at some point.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.950
These footprints are too clean.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.070
It looks like the place was cleaned up first,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.390
and then stamped it with footprints 
to make it look visited.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.550
Were people gathered here for some purpose?

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.250
I'd heard that some of our 
men had come to the grave.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.500
You, too?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.610
No.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.110
I'm here to pay respects to the late Yo.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.390
I want him to return to nature.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:38.000
Gozan, Yuki, Ren, Akashi, 
Kyoichiro, Morito...

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.050
He should be with them.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.190
Gozan? Yuki? Who are they?

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.580
Those are the names of our warriors

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.230
who died by poison gas when 
we attacked the village.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.240
Ah.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.950
I'd like to bury what we have 
left of Yo next to his friends.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.540
It's the birth of our happy papercraft tank!

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.230
This is exhilarating!

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.840


00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.840
Tank
acquired!!

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.130
Does this gun actually fire?

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.810
We don't even have gunpowder.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.370
We're using a leather rupture disk.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:22.770
A rup-what?

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:24.180
A burst diaphragm.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:26.310
It explodes when it's expanded.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.940
We'll break down water with electricity,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.860
and when the oxygen and hydrogen 
gas fills up the disk...

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.860
Ignition!

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.740
Ah, I see!

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.900
Even I understood how that one works.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.490
Wait! It'll tear after the first use, 
and then we can't use it anymore!

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.160
That's fine.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:53.830
Any modern person who sees a tank 
around will instantly lose morale.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.760
That's for sure.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.340
If we're going to take over 
without any casualties,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.880
we're going to need to make lightning 
strike right after the tank attack.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.020
Yeah.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.020
Within the first half-minute of 
the battle for the miracle cave,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.610
we'll send in all of the 
Kingdom of Science's forces.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.450
And for that, we're going to need

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.240
the number one, most overpowered, 
toughest man around...

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.590
It's strange.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.490
I've never seen you before, 
and yet I know your name...

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.590
Taiju.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.510
Senku!

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.190
The Kingdom of Science 
now has a full deck of cards.

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.590
It's the beginning of the final 
battle against the Tsukasa Empire.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.080
This is exhilarating!

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.940
According to the research of a Harvard 
psychologist named Shawn Achor,

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.450
a human impulse lasts for 
no more than 20 seconds.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.760
The enemy will only have the instinct

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.920
to run away for the first 20 seconds of our raid.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.410
After that, the enemy will come 
to their senses and retaliate.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.120
If we fight, people will die.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.840
Everyone, brace yourselves!

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.920
The fate of all of humanity will 
be decided in these 20 seconds!

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.990
