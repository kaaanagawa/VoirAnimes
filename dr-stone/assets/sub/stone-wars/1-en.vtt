00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.400
A long, long time ago...

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.460
Out of nowhere, a strange light 
rained down upon the world.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.860
The <i>entire</i> world.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.310
And that light turned everyone into stone.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.810
After that, the world slowly collapsed.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.740
The buildings and everything else,
all of civilization, vanished.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.810
After humanity had spent 
millions of years building it.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.520
What a shame!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.990
But there was one man who hadn't given up.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.080
Even after he was petrified, 
he held on to his consciousness.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.490
In fact, he kept counting the seconds.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.360
The date and time are too
precious to forget, he figured.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.500
He's absolutely nuts.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.010
And that man... was Senku-chan!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.050
One summer day, thousands of years 
after humanity was petrified,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.680
Senku-chan awoke, all alone.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.150
He found himself in an empty, primitive Earth.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.650
I probably would've died 
helplessly on the spot.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.420
But Senku-chan is an awesome science whiz.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.120
He made his own food, clothes, and shelter...

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.530
and eventually, he also made the revival fluid!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.960
Senku's awesome!

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.760
I want to be like Senku, too!

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.550
The kids certainly love him.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.960
Well, then, let's hear a word 
from our amazing leader.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.560
Senku-chan!

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.060
Sure, whatever. That was absolutely riveting.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.570
Your super stone world 
foundation story was epic.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.820
I'm bawling over here.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.480
Also, Gen, quit babbling 
and put your hands to work.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.160
You got me. I was procrastinating.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.940
So, he used the revival fluid 
to bring back this tough,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.930
mighty guy named Tsukasa-chan.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
This is a stone world.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.900
An untainted paradise.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.770
We'll revive only the pure-hearted youth

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.600
and live in a natural world owned by no one.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.320
It's a chance to purify humanity.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.440
Don't you agree, Senku?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.930
Not at all.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.250
Not even a millimeter.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.420
I'm going to use the power of science 
to rescue every single person.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.430
They ended up in a massive disagreement.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.070
So while Tsukasa-chan is all like,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.400
"Let's build a new world!"
and reviving people to join him,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.110
Senku-chan built a kingdom of science 
on top of this village in order to fight him.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.270
We're the Kingdom of Science!

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.740
Down with Tsukasa!

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.350
Although, Senku-chan...

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.920
We worked so hard on 
the cell phone so we could

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.620
execute a preemptive 
strike on Tsukasa-chan.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.040
Shouldn't we get moving? It's going to be 
spring soon, and they'll come knocking.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.600
What are we making next?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.920
Yeah...

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.920
That's why we're going to finish up 
this super science project item.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.300
A super item?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.600
We're going to defeat the 
Tsukasa Empire with agility and speed.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.110
We're making humanity's greatest 
survival science product: space food!

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.840
Sp...

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.810
...ace?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.140
Food?

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.050
Here we go again!

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.520
Another craft that couldn't 
possibly belong in a stone world!

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.460
What's "space"?

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.210
It's that place way, way above the sky.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.360
This is starting to sound exciting again.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.220
I can't wait!

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.180
It's just food, though, isn't it?

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.150
Yeah.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.070
We're upgrading our favorite foxtail 
millet ramen to be fit for battle.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.130
Me! Me! I'll help!

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.370
I want ramen so bad!

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.560
Seriously! <i>So</i> bad!

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.240
Ginro, what are you trying to say?

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.530
But why do we need this 
space... ramen for battle?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.040
Ah! We're launching steaming hot 
ramen at the enemy, correct?

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.210
I don't think that's it, Father.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.160
There isn't any gravity in space,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.550
let alone the room or time 
to sit down for a meal.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.020
This stuff is quick to prepare and nutritious.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.030
It's also small and light.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.210
That's the super well-thought-out, 
precious food that is space food.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.860
I see.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.280
Tsukasa-chan doesn't want 
to attack in the winter

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.570
partly because he wants more men, but...

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.000
It's a simple problem.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.080
In this stone world, a mega-cold 
winter battlefield is hell.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.620
But we can overcome that 
problem with science.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.220
A warm, proper meal that 
we can prepare instantly

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.230
would give us a ten billion 
percent advantage.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.170
It's the ultimate weapon in a winter battle.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.680
Warm science food is going to keep us 
powered up, in both body and spirit!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.120
Space food sounds amazing!

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.070
This is the final super item for 
our attack on the Tsukasa Empire.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Foxtail millet

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Egg

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Fish

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Meat

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Veggies

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Ramen

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Rope

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Trees

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Portable containers

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Iron

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Level 2 blowing
machines

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Gears

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Pumps

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Water wheel

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Vacuum devices

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Snow

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.480
Space food

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.480
Let's get started!

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.230
Leave us to make the ramen.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.380
Now that everyone in the 
village has come together,

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.780
we can be more efficient than ever.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.990
The maker team's gotta keep up, too.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.160
We're going to build a machine to 
upgrade that ramen into space ramen!

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.880
But how does this work?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.040
We're going to vacuum the ramen.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.760
We'll take all the air out.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.480
It's the same as what we did before.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.470
Ah, when we built the cell phones.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.770
Those vacuum tubes were a real pain.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.450
Wait, vacuum the ramen?

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.890
What does that mean?

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.450 line:20%
Ramen

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.800
Sneak...

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.260
Okay, the ramen's done.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.470
Now we just need to warm it up in soup.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.120
That won't be necessary.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.340
We're freezing it solid.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.990
Why are we freezing all this delicious ramen?!

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.180
The rules are the rules.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.890
Stop talking and get to work, Ginro!

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.360
This is space ramen?

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.180
No, this is just frozen food.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.830
We're going to lighten this to Hell and back 
so our troops can be even more mobile.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.920
Lighten ramen?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.680
You don't mean...

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.610
That's right.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.330
We're making cup noodles.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.510
It's the birth of freeze-dried food.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.190
Freeze-dried, huh?

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.810
I've heard of it, but what 
exactly are we doing?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.070
We're literally freezing 
it and then drying it.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.690
That's all it is.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.950
When you freeze food, 
the moisture inside turns to ice.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.970
Solid

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.200
Yeah, of course.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.700
I get that much.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.000
Put that in a vacuum, and the lack of air 
in the environment turns the water...

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.790
Poof! Into vapor.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:53.590
That dries out the food and 
makes it super small and light.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.720
This is all too complicated for me.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.640
How exactly do we do the "poof!" part?

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.570
That's what the maker team's for.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.820
It's done!

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.070
Check this out.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.410
We used the water wheel that 
we suffered so much to build...

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.840
to build a freeze drying machine!

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.410
I'm impressed, Chrome, Kaseki!

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.430
Everything here is made using things 
we built together with Senku.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.630
Yeah.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:40.760
That's what humanity did, working away 
diligently over the past two million years.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.830
That's science.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.590
We have freeze-dried ramen!

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.900


00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.900
Space food acquired!!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.220
Yes!

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.080
Wait, what is this?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.320
It does look small and light, but...

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.450
Uh, it looks gross.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.500
It's all spongy and rough.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.480
Just watch.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.170
Is this really edible, though?

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.380
Yo, I'll be the guinea pig!

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.810
A science user never hesitates 
to jump on anything new!

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.990
You've said that before, too.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.230
I'm pretty sure you just want 
to be the first to eat it.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.030
Yum!

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.680
Is it just me, or is it even better than 
before, now that it's nice and hot?!

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.360
Here you go.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.490
Now we can fight and eat at the same time!

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:37.880
I don't know if that really gives 
us an advantage, Magma-chan.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.550
I don't want anyone to get hurt.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.140
We can't avoid fighting anymore, can we?

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.060
We aren't going to go kill anyone.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.310
The victory condition for the Kingdom 
of Science is remarkably simple.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.820
We just want to capture the miracle cave 
where we can gather the revival fluid.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.300
If we can keep in touch with my friends 
on the other side using our cell phones,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.550
we could even accomplish a bloodless siege.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.500
Are these friends of yours truly safe?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.500
They've been infiltrating the enemy 
army this whole time, haven't they?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.790
Are they not in danger?

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.260
Not one millimeter of concern there.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:26.770
Taiju and Yuzuriha aren't 
going to croak that easily.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.870
I wonder what they're like.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:34.950
Considering they're Senku's friends, 
they must be really, really smart.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.040
Who the hell are these people?!

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.860
They look nothing like that!

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.450
Taiju's a simpleton who's 
in charge of brawny stuff!

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.890
Huh?! Not what I expected...

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.670
It's become the official background music.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.580
Amazing, huh?

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.720
Lillian-chan, the world's diva.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.950
Everyone's in love, even in this age.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.220
Her voice is still so beautiful, 
even after hearing it so many times.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.350
Everyone in the Tsukasa army 
should hear this record, too.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.400
It's so pretty, I'm destroyed!

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.070
Maybe it'll convince them to 
stop attacking or something.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.360
Lillian-chan's songs are way 
too familiar to modern people.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.830
They aren't going to be destroyed by it.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.330
Besides, with this audio quality...

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.130
This audio quality...

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.280
Just come up already.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.650
What do you want?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.070
Heya.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.490
I didn't want the pure-hearted to hear.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.780
Like Kinro-chan and Kokuyo-chan.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.500
It already sounds like 
you've got a skeevy plan.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.500
Good guess.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.090
All we need is the record 
and a pair of phones.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.970
If it works out, we can actually 
save seven billion people

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.760
in a bloodless siege on the Tsukasa Empire.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.760
But if God happens to be watching,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:44.400
Ishigami Senku and Asagiri Gen 
are going to Hell together.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.110
Not to worry.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:52.670
God's been absent in the world 
of science for ten billion years.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.920
Let's hear it, mentalist.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.480
I didn't want the pure-hearted to hear.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.840
Like Kinro-chan and Kokuyo-chan.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:13.890 line:20%
It already sounds like 
you've got a skeevy plan.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.680
Senku and Gen? Holding a secret meeting?

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.680 line:20%
Good guess.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:16.900
Quiz time!

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.690
The secret to Tsukasa-chan's empire.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.230
What's the unifying force 
that brings them together?

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.440
A: Food.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.960
B: Hot chicks.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.200
C: Tsukasa-chan himself.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.080
C, obviously.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.370
Ding, ding, ding! Ten billion points!

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:40.180
Tsukasa-chan's always been a popular figure,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.250
with his "strongest high 
school primate" title.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.410
Which means that, in order 
to break them apart,

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.800
we just need someone who's as famous 
and popular as Tsukasa-chan.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.800
Hi! I'm Lillian Weinberg.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.800
A woman's voice!

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.350
From that record!

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.130
I can kind of fake a woman's voice, too.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.570
Although it's pretty tough.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.330
No, that was close.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.510
That was really close.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:17.080
But it's going to be totally 
obvious that it's a guy's voice.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.490
I know, right?

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.040
But what if the voice came over 
our low-quality, noisy phones?

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.780
And you're using the voice from 
the record as authentication.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.550
Ding, ding, ding! A hundred billion points!

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.180
What are they talking about?

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.260
Lillian's live singing, heard over the phone...

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.810
A powerful voice only she could pull off.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.060
Well, it <i>is</i> her, after all.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:51.290
You'd have to believe that Lillian's 
alive and on the other end of the phone.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.240
This is Lillian Weinberg 
calling from America.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.670
People of Japan, please hear me out.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.120
The world hasn't collapsed.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.110
The United States has already recovered.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.630
Help is on the way to Japan, as well.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.170
So you're going to make a zombie 
Lillian to tell a big, fat lie,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.120
and deceive everyone with false hope.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.030
We're <i>definitely</i> going to Hell.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.220
Okay, got it. We'll figure out the details later.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.330
Let's go with that.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:27.770
That was quick!

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:34.280
What do you mean, "okay, got it"?! 
I didn't get any of that!

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.450
Tell him from the top, mentalist.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:47.010
First, we deliver the cell phone 
to Taiju-chan and Yuzuriha-chan.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.100
We very quietly let Tsukasa's army hear it, 
and play Lillian-chan's songs.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.610
Thus we trick them.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.300
This call is coming from America.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.470
The world hasn't collapsed!

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.890
They all think the old 
world's been destroyed.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.100
That's the only reason they're 
following their great leader Tsukasa.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.230
Well, it <i>is</i> destroyed.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:15.890
If they think there's help on the 
way, that changes everything.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.010
After we make most of 
Tsukasa's army turn on him,

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.200
we coordinate using our cell phones

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.200
and conquer them in one swift move.
Not a single drop of blood will be spilled.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.900
Wait, they'll figure out you lied later!

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.030
Who cares?

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.300
None of that matters once we capture 
Tsukasa-chan and Hyoga-chan.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.270
Of course you'd come up with a ten billion 
percent underhanded plan like that.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.850
It's exhilarating!

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:48.360
Everyone in the Tsukasa Empire is 
going to hate us to death later.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.700
That's all.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.650
Don't tell the villagers what we're doing.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.320
We don't need any villains from 
the old world besides the two of us.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.540
What the hell are you talking about?

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.470
I'm an accomplice now that you've told me.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.480
You were the one who barged 
into the discussion.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.790
Literally.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.170
I'm the one carrying out the plan, anyway.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.630
You're going to need a technician to deploy 
that giant-ass cell phone, aren't you?

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.180
They already recognize you, 
Senku. This is my job.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.600
Let's go to Hell together, the three of us.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.980
But in exchange, let's save the world—
all seven billion people.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.430
All right, we're all set.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.810
We have three task forces:

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.850
Chrome on engineering,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.110
Magma on transporting the cell phone,

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.280
and Gen on navigation.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.030
There's just one big problem...

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.850
The Tsukasa army scout, Homura.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.830
Judging from the lack of snow 
on the branches on that hill,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.570
I'm pretty sure she's watching from there.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.630
11.0 vision

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.210
You can see that?!

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:35.630
Of course not.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.610
That would be a good route.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.760
It's a straight line from 
here to the Tsukasa Empire.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.780
If they find out about 
our preemptive strike,

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.120
or worse, learn that we have 
cell phones, it's all over.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.600
What if we set out in 
the middle of the night?

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.850
We're carrying vacuum tubes.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.010
It's all over if we trip in the darkness.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.680
Could we outrun them?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.570
Look at all this stuff 
we're carrying, dumbass.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.360
That might not work.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.990
Not a problem.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.330
We're going to lure Homura to the other 
side using a super science gadget.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.990
The main force will move out in the meantime.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.840
A super science gadget?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.080
If you run electricity through water, 
it boils up hydrogen and oxygen.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.170
The mixed gas you get out of 
it is called a detonating gas.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.390
Put it in a balloon, like one 
made out of a deer's bladder,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.620
and you've got a wimpy bomb that 
makes an insanely loud noise.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.640
In other words, a sonic bomb.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:38.860
All right, here we go.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.820
Time for our preemptive strike.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.170
Detonate the sonic bombs!

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.580
Now! Go! The other side!

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.760
Go!

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.380
It's the final battle versus 
the Tsukasa Empire...

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.630
The beginning of the Stone Wars!

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.070
This is exhilarating!

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.050
