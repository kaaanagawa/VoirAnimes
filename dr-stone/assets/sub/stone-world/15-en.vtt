WEBVTT

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.900
I'll leave the village for now.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.890
You wouldn't want to have 
to deal with an outsider

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.030
who isn't even a contestant, 
right, Kinro-chan the guard?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.030
We can talk about your end of our deal

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.570
after you've captured 
the village, Senku-chan.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.620
Sure.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.620
Chrome...

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.100
Ruri-ch—

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.010
Priestess, you're going to 
have to marry the winner, huh?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.890
Don't worry.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
Now it's just up to me or 
Senku to give up the victory.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.600
The winner is going to be Chrome.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.350
I can tell, you know.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.940
You really wanted Chrome 
to win, didn't you?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280 line:20%
Ow, ow, ow!

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.780
Good job figuring out the difference 
between convex and concave, Chrome.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.730
No, as the priestess, 
I have no such thoughts.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.970
I'm only a servant of the gods.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.130
I will marry the winner of the Grand Bout.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.630
Really?

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.700
Huh, I always thought...

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.880
Wait a second... Does that mean 
you don't really care who wins?!

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.690
Huh?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.710
Well...

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.730
That's right.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.070
Try to read between the 
lines a little, Ginro.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.520
What else is Ruri-sama supposed to say?

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.270
Village Chief

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.160
Village chief...

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.260
Ginro!

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.710
Scumbag

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.230
Match two of the semi-finals will now begin.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.060
Senku versus Ginro.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.830
Both contestants, forward.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.330
What the hell's gotten into you, Ginro?!

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
I mean...

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.660
Ruri-chan said she'll marry anyone!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.080
So maybe I have a shot at 
being village chief, too!

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.800
Maybe it's finally my time to shine!

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.810
G-Ginro, you...

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.180
He's way too scummy.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.350
If I become the chief, 
I'll get to have ramen every day!

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.990
And a harem!

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.690
I'm going to turn it into 
a super awesome village!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.150
I think he's...

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.830
Ginro... Anyone but you.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.250
We can't let him become the village chief.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.700
We have to take down that scum now!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.710
But Senku doesn't stand a chance.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.300
Senku...

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.640
Our weapon is science, is it not?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.940
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.400
You're about to use some 
crazy sorcery, aren't you?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.490
No you don't!

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.870
That man is smart. Senku, was it?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.970
Winner: Senku!

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.700
Ginro's down!

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.880
Senku's going to the finals!

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.930
The whole village has come together!

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.030
Yeah.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.560
Now we can turn the village 
into a kingdom of science...

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.560
And we can save... Ruri...

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.030
All right, it's the final now.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.000
Now I just need to lose on purpose,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.970
and Chrome, you'll marry Ruri 
and become the village chief.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.030
Happily ever afters all around!

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.290
Get up and...

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.420
Um, he's conked out.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.060
He must be mighty relieved to know 
that Ruri-nee's going to be all right.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.500
Eh?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.970
Does that mean...

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.180
What happens now?

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.400
Does that mean the final...

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.660
The new village chief, 
the husband of the priestess...

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.580
is the winner of the Grand Bout, Senku!

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.050 position:20%
Position of village chief and marriage partner acquired!!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.980
The Culmination of Two Million Years

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.370
S-So...

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.560
What now?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.430
Well, this is a pain in the ass.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.820
So I just have to marry Ruri, 
and the whole village is mine, right?

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.540
I'll do it, then.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.620
Senku's married!

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.140
Hold it, Senku! Where do you even come from?

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.880
I won't allow an outsider 
to become the chief!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.740
Well, well, if it isn't 
the former village chief.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.800
I don't have a millimeter of 
interest in your lack of approval.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.370
Who are we supposed to side with?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.540
With Kokuyo-sama, obviously!

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.700
What are you, mental?!

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.060
But he won in front of the 
gods, fair and square.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.070
And he's married to the priestess, too.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.740
Whatever. A win is a win.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.240
Wine! Bring me wine!

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.160
That's too blunt!

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.580
You sound like one of <i>those</i> people!

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.310
This barrel's no good.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.360
It's turned into vinegar.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.820
Don't chuck it! We need that, too!

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.830
Ruri-nee!

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.910
Ruri!

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.800
I'm fine.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.350
She's definitely out of time.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.310
We just finished the Bout, 
and I don't even have time to rest.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.570
Let's head back and 
finish the sulfa drug—

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.570 line:20%
Hold it!

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.690
Where do you think you're going? 
You're the guest of honor.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.200
Come on, have a drink.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.620
We're drinking through the night 
to celebrate. It's tradition.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.820
Oh, really?

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.790
I'm divorcing, then.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.290
Senku got divorced!

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.300
I got a ton of alcohol and vinegar!

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.580
Let's haul ass, 
citizens of the kingdom of science!

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.510
Since when am I a citizen 
of the kingdom of science?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.560
Sorry, Ruri-nee! I'll explain later!

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.700
That man is utterly insane.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.740
I'm a little confused, but it seems I've 
become the first divorced priestess ever.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.620
Right, Chrome?

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.080
This is bullshit!

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.380
Capture that man!

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.410
Senku is not evil.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.670
Please let him explain for himself

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.780
what the sorcerers—I mean, science users—

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.260
have been risking their lives 
to do for the past half year.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.650
What I've seen them do.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.700
What's this?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.180
The river water is making 
the bamboo spin around.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.330
I nailed it on my first attempt.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.550
Go, me!

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.890
You can fall in love with 
me if you want, girls.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.390
Not bad.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.770
I usually botch my first few 
attempts at building anything.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.700
Senku, you don't need 
to fall in love with me.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.290
So what does this let us make?

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.800
That's the thing.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.380
I have no idea.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.550
You'll find out tomorrow.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.260
I'll keep an eye on it for a while.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.180
I'd cry if my child were to be 
destroyed by driftwood or something.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.420
You!

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.670
Are you going to leave a weak 
old man to stand guard by himself?!

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.510
Stay and help. I'm sure you 
have nothing better to do!

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.030
Give me a break, grampa!

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.770
Uh, sure. Yes. I'll help you.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.410
Weak old man?!

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.410
Wake up and smell the ammonia.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.260
Get up and help out, science team!

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.820
Now we just need to put it 
together, and we're done.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.630
We're going to finish the ultimate 
cure-all sulfa drug by tomorrow.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.860
Tomorrow?!

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.190
Fun with Making Sulfa Drugs

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.580
Fun with Making Sulfa Drugs.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.190
Step one.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.330
First, we're using a burnable 
rock called coal to...

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.530
Burnable rocks!

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.850
Got it.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.540
I have some in my shelter.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.750
We used up all of it when we made iron.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.170
Damn it!

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.180
Don't worry.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.940
We can find plenty of the kind 
of cheap coal that you gathered

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.170
from any of the mountains around here.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.150
Besides, it's not even 
the coal that we want.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.930
It's the coal tar that's 
left after it's burned.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.700
First, wash it with hydrochloric acid,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.450
then throw in ethyl acetate made from 
alcohol and vinegar, and we have anilin.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.600
Hold it, hold it!

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.400
I'm already totally lost!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.870
That's step one?

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.410
How many of these complicated 
steps are we doing by tomorrow?

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.830
Oh, up to... step 25, maybe?

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.550
Holy...

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.410
So what is this thing, anyway?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.200
Can I look inside already?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.150
Is this...

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.960
Carbonated water
acquired!!

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.220
Can you make some, Senku-chan?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.390
Can you make a bottle of cola?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.850
Yeah, I can.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.680
Even if no one else can.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.190
Nah, there's no way he's </i>that<i> nice!

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.570
Senku-chan, what's this fizzy water for?

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.070
Oh, no!

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.520
Was there an explosion or something?

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.710
This is pretty bad, huh?

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.870
What have you done?

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.290
We haven't done anything, really.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.850
We poured vinegar on some cooked shells,

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:04.210
extracted glacial acetic acid using sulfuric 
acid, turned it into ketene in an iron pipe,

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.050
and put it back to make acetic anhydride.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.750
H-Huh. I see.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.140
So I tried to drip that acetic 
anhydride into the aniline,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.570
but I poured on way too much, and kaboom.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.520
So that's what this wreckage is from.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.860
Mix the chlorosulfuric acid into 
the acetanilide we just made,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.140
and we get 
para-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.740
Throw some ammonia in there to make 
para-acetamidobenzenesulfonic acid,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.910
cook it in hydrochloric acid, 
and you get that stuff.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.800
I'm impressed you can say that 
without stuttering, Senku-chan.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.090
Lastly, that carbonated water.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.740
Oh, right, Senku-chan.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.600
I'm not expecting anything, but...

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.920
That's right. You know what 
carbonated water means.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.550
Carbonated water means...

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.620
We mix it with sodium hydroxide 
to make baking soda!

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.820
Right.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.760
Of course. Baking soda.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.520
That's what I was thinking.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.450
Step 25.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.650
Finally, we wash this stuff with 
baking soda, and then we wait.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.030
It's been a long time.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.450
Half a year.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Iron

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Alcohol

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Electricity

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Vinegar

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Sodium
Bicarbonate

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Salt

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Sulfuric
Acid

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Urine

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Powerful
Magnets

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Copper

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Phosphorus

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Sodium
Hydroxide

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Sodium
Hydrogen Sulfate

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Coal

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Aniline

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Chlorosulfuric Acid

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Hydrochloric Acid

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Carbonic Acid

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Acetic Anhydride

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Ammonia

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.380
Cure-all
Sulfa Drugs

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:21.810
It's been crazy.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.810
Sulfanilamide.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.880
Also known as...

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:32.860
the cure-all sulfa drug.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:33.720
It's done!

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.930
Yeah!

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.060
Finally...

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.520
Finally, Ruri-nee...

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.170
Don't start crying yet, idiot.

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.320
Wait until she's actually better.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.990
I'm not crying!

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.990
Too bad.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:57.910
I can't go inside the village,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.870
so I won't be there to see Ruri-chan take it.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.360
Have fun waiting at the lab by yourself.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.950
Gen did lots and lots of work, too.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.630
I feel sorry for him.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.140
I guess this is just the 
way it is for bats like me.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.820
Hey, I'm Mecha Senku!

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:27.230
Mix together carbonated water, cilantro,

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.130
lime, and honey caramel, and you get cola.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.180
Try tossing some lime zest 
onto crushed cilantro.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.830
You'll be shocked at how 
much it smells like cola!

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.270
Ruri, don't worry.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.020
That medicine is the powder 
of life, born from stone.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.060
It's the cure-all of science.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.490
It'll knock out your sickness for sure!

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:35.010
A mystery bug versus the culmination 
of two million years of human science...

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.060
This is exhilarating.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.090
All right, I finally get to see my patient.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.990
Time to make a diagnosis.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.450
Say "Ee."

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.600
It sounds like a goat bleating.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.050
That's evidence that there's 
fluid in her lungs.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.760
What are you doing with 
that mouse, Senku-chan?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.410
Are we eating it?

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.810
I like how that's the first 
thing that comes to your mind.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.130
Well, I don't eat rats, either.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:30.450
I'm glad.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.500
Usually.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.290
Usually, huh?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.050
They're a good source of protein.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.680
But unfortunately, we aren't 
eating it this time.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.850
This is an autopsy.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.090
Red inflammation all over the lungs.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.770
It's definitely a bacterial infection.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.590
Even the mice are catching it.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.910
The question is what 
species of bacteria it is.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.740
Even a cure-all has its limits.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.060
It's not ten billion percent guaranteed 
that it'll take down any bacteria.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.930
If Ruri has pulmonary tuberculosis...

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.420
If the enemy is a tuberculosis germ...

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.520
We don't stand a chance.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.370
This is bad!

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.320
Ruri-nee is...

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.620
Ruri-nee is...

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.180
You don't need to get up.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.220
Stay on your side.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.950
Breathe slowly.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.780
It's never been this bad before.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.040
She may be in danger.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.550
It started as soon as she had 
that suspicious white powder.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.090
I told you not to trust sorcery medicine!

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.460
Ruri!

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.550
Ruri-nee!

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.440
Senku...

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.440
Senku, you bastard!

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.410
It's because of that drug!

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.130
Father!

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.470
If it weren't for that drug,

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.320
Ruri wouldn't have taken 
such a turn for the worse!

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.490
You might be right.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.420
I knew it!

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.570
The bacteria is getting serious.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.700
It's making allies by spreading

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.920
its toxic genes into the harmless 
bacteria all around it.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.680
It's the pneumococcus 
bacteria's special move.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.290
Which means Ruri's disease...

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.260
is pneumonia.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:29.410
Don't underestimate pneumonia.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.650
It's a deadly disease that's killed 
hundreds of millions of people.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:39.150
But sulfa drugs absolutely 
<i>destroy</i> pneumococcus bacteria.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.870
We won!

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.250
Human science has won!

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.840
Now that we know what it is, 
we have the upper hand.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.910
We just need to throw 
more sulfa drug at her.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.250
Enough of this!

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.880
Father, this is nothing like the 
fraudulent sorcery that you know.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.460
It's called science.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.870
It's the culmination of human wisdom.

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.270
I believe in science, and in Senku.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.230
Yeah, so do I!

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.940
I kind of do, too.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.710
Sheesh, Ruri.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:32.910
I'm actually surprised 
she lived to eighteen.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:38.460
Stay clean and keep warm, and the 
disease's progression will slow.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:49.610
The hot spring water that Kohaku hauled 
in every day ended up protecting Ruri.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.860
Ruri...

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.490
Ruri!

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.790
I don't remember how 
many years it's been...

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.230
since I've left the village 
or been able to run!

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.240
Kohaku-chan's rambunctiousness must 
have run in the family all along.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.120
Listen, all!

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:58.730
From this day forth, this man, Senku, 
is the new chief of Ishigami Village!

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.660
Ishigami Village?

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.140
Yes, Senku.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.140
I've known about you for a long time.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:19.010
Your name is Ishigami Senku.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:58.910
A Tale for the Ages

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.050
Next Time

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.050
A Tale for the Ages

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.040
