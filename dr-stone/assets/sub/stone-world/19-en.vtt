00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.420
That's the guy Tsukasa-san's 
been looking for all this time.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.250
What? Really?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.550
Who is this guy?

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.100
Hello, Hyoga.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.560
You're 3,700 years in the future.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.490
This is a new world, 
where your skills can truly shine.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.560
I was wondering what kind of 
badass he was going to revive,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.800
but this guy's just a little twig!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.210
Is he really gonna be of any use?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.590
You'll understand if you fight him.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.880
Care for a spar?

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.660
You sure? He might end up dead.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.810
I feel kinda bad for the guy.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.390
He just woke up, after all!

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.810
I don't mind.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.110
If I can use my favored weapon, 
I'll take on ten men by myself.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.370
Too late to back out now!

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.390
Well, that's certainly impressive.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.260
I apologize. There weren't enough men 
for a warm-up spar after your rest.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.550
It's not a question of numbers.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.660
The only proper fighter here...

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.330
in other words, the one 
I wouldn't want to fight,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.070
is you, the strongest primate, 
Shishio Tsukasa-kun.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.870
Let me show you around our new world.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.480
You see, Hyoga, nature is 
generous with its bounty.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.690
We lack nothing.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.200
The world was like that for ages, 
long before people began to live on it.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.770
It didn't belong to anyone.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.330
But the moment you and I were 
born, the old world told us:

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.500
"This world, down to its 
last square centimeter,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.130
belongs to some rich old fool."

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.030
That's right.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.030
I worked myself ragged day in and day out,

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.340
then had to give up more than 
half of it for rent and whatnot.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.230
That's more or less slavery, 
looking back on it now.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.330
The privileged exploit the impoverished 
young, feeding on them.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.630
That was the old world, where people 
fought and stole from each other.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.490
I'm a lot happier now.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.200
Although part of that comes from being a fan

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.000
of the strongest primate, Tsuka-san.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.350
Hey, we caught a big one!

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.820
We're back, Tsukasa-san.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.200
Excellent work.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.880 line:20%
We managed to find a boar this time. 
Brought it down, too!

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.930
Well, Tsukasa-chan was already 
charismatic in the old world...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.930 line:20%
Thank you both.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.270
Take someone strong, 
handsome, and soft-spoken,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.390
give him a half-decent argument,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.750
and it'll be tough to talk 
anyone into turning on him.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.000
Now, Hyoga, would you have called the 
society of 3,700 years ago a utopia?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.750
Not at all.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.240
Suppose the privileged class of 
the old world was revived now,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.510
and they obtained the weapons of 
science that make killing so easy.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.010
What do you think would happen?

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.390
I imagine they'd try to use 
those weapons to recreate

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.510
the pyramid of wealth they stood upon.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.520
No one who has sampled that 
sweet nectar could ever abandon it.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.580
Regardless, this world has been reset

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.860
and is in no condition to 
support seven billion lives.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.360
There must be a culling.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.370
The two most dangerous fighters, 
and they're in total agreement...

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.610
Then a new world must be built by the young.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.310
There's no need to recreate the old one.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.060
There was a... I'm not sure 
I can call him a friend,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.690
but a man named Senku who had 
a superhuman grasp of science,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.080
and he sought to revive the old world.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.360
So...

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.110
I killed him with my own hands.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.610
With no Senku, there will be no science.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.150
The corrupt human race will be purified 
and march on to a new world.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.120
To accomplish that...

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.910
I'll stain my hands as much as necessary.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.030
To Modernity

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.430
Th-They even cut through Hyoga-san's spear!

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.240
Damn it, it's useless! Run for it!

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.700
We did it!

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.630
Remarkable athleticism, 
coordinated teamwork,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.720
and dirty betrayal...

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.080
And the scientific knowledge to 
create guns and Japanese katanas.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.890
You people truly seem to know 
the proper way to do things.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.010
It would have been even more 
proper if you had realized

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.710
that all of this was a distraction.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.700
So that's what they were after...

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.450
Crap! A fire!

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.770
Run!

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.640
Head for the bridge! Hurry!

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.290
Jasper! Turquoise!

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.280
I don't need protection! Save the children!

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.270
Right!

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.520
The bridge...

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.210
Who is that?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.650
A hindrance.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.840
Get everyone to safety!

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.530
Another one?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.540
Say hello to my right hand, Homura-kun.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:26.850
She can properly handle herself, 
unlike these men and their melted brains.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.150
What are those moves?

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.030
This is not good.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.960
Once a fire starts,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.750
the wind from the mountain
will become a wind of death,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.910
carrying the flames far and wide!

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.040
Everyone!

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.710
This way!

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.130
Forget about the houses! 
Do you people want to die?!

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.730
Get out of here right now!

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.660
We can't go that way, either! 
The bridge is burned out!

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.890
We have to get to the science shed!

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.670
Nice work, Homura.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.350
I couldn't leave after being 
humiliated like that.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.690
Your humiliation means nothing.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.780
We set those fires to force 
the villagers out into the open.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:00.510
That should be obvious, 
even to your melted brain.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:07.840
We're dealing with people so naive that they
wouldn't even abandon a village guard.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.030
Why does that matter?

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.030
I get it!

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.240
We grab one of the kids that we smoked out

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.070
and use 'em as a hostage! Then we win!

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.110
Of course! That makes sense!

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.760
There's no guarantee they'll attack head-on.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.310
Keep your senses spread 
out in every direction!

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.270
Can we really protect a group this big?!

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.370
Shelter the children in the 
science shed! It's our only hope!

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.570
O-Okay!

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.720
Get the water!

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.920
This way, hurry!

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.670
Start dousing, quick!

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.670
Hurry up!

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.060
It's burning up!

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.360
All those minerals Chrome 
spent years gathering,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.870
and the lab we spent months building!

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.870
If it gets wrecked, we'll...

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:59.610
I'm going to protect the kingdom of science!

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.950
Look!

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.910
Some dumb kid who didn't get away in time!

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.610
After her! She'll be our hostage!

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:17.710
So devoted that she'd act as a 
diversion to help the others?

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.820
I certainly appreciate her naïveté.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.370
We only need one captive to win,

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.720
and this will be far easier than attacking 
the home base of those soldiers of science.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.440
Gotta hide and run in turns to lure 
them away from the kingdom of science.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.640
I'll run upwind, toward the mountain,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.280
so they can't smoke me out with more fire!

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.010
There she is! That way!

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.490
Suika did what?!

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.300
I-I tried to stop her!

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.530
She was heading up the mountain
to the hot springs!

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.250
Hey, this is the hot spring area that 
I draw hot water from all the time.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.880
It gets dangerous up ahead.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.760
The poison gases that form here,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.590
hydrogen sulfide and sulfur 
dioxide, are heavier than air.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.370
There's a strong wind coming 
down the mountain...

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800
Something about this wind...

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.170
It's not exactly giving me a good feeling.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.860
Give it up already!

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.020
Let's break one of her 
legs when we catch her!

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.910
This wind... Death.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.050
Suika!

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.260
Get up into a tree!

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.230
Wh-What just happened?!

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.120
You don't have to worry.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.010
The poison gas will settle to the bottom.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.280
Did she say... poison gas?!

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.450
Mother Nature is neither friend nor foe.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.380
She's as impartial as they come.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.160
Poison gas?!

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.750
Did you make this happen, you twig?!

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.090
Yeah, you bet I did.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.330
That's what you get for pulling a 
dumbass move like a suicide attack

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.790
on our kingdom of science, 
with its modern weaponry.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.490
Now, let's head back, Suika.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.890
If you breathe nice and slow, you'll be fine.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.860
O-Okay!

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.020
You guys head back and suckle 
on Mommy Tsukasa's teat...

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.710
After you wait ten billion seconds 
for the gas to clear out, that is.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.890
Is he screwing with us?! 
I'm not gonna wait ten billion seconds!

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:09.230
How could he even make poison gas in 
this stone world in the first place?!

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.140
Good point. Let's deal with this properly.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.900
We'll need to make sure the 
gas is gone before we move.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.510
How fortunate that you lot

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.230
will finally do a job properly, 
despite your melted brains.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.970
Well, look at that. They properly died.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.050
So those gas masks, at least, were real.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.350
It seems that Senku-kun

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:53.930
and his allies have a variety of metals 
and chemicals under their control.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.490
The kingdom of science 
certainly does loom large.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.290
We can always rebuild the lost buildings!

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.860
We've repelled the attackers 
without a single casualty!

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:08.080
Ishigami Village has won this battle!

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.120
You managed quite the achievement, Suika.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.650
It was reckless as all get out, though.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.200
We'll need to overwhelm them with numbers.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.650
Tsukasa-kun and I will be 
among them, of course,

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.480
along with the most massive, powerful 
fighting force the empire can muster.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.170
What are you going to do now?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.200
Tsukasa-chan's finally about 
to find out that you're alive.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.690
Yeah, and he'll also figure out that 
we can't produce the gunpowder

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.580
for guns fast enough.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.060
Wait, we can't?

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.580
What do you mean?

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.620
Listen up. The revival fluid that 
Tsukasa's guys have been cranking out

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.920
is actually pretty easy to make.

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.560
But we haven't revived a single statue.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.270
And that's because we don't 
have the nitric acid we need.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.330
We could make some 
from dung or sea shells,

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.440
but it'd take an insane amount 
and too much time.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.650
No nitric acid means no gunpowder, either.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.780
Tsukasa is smart enough to 
figure that out easily.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.910
We don't even have any leftovers 
in our gunpowder supply.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.270
There's so much science lingo, 
I'm not quite following...

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.750
Break it down more simply, would you?!

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:51.620
I'm trying to say that even if we have guns, 
he knows we can't really use them.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.760
And knowing Tsukasa, 
he'll have a full army built up,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.510
ready for a huge invasion.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.560
The more time passes, the more 
fighters they have, after all...

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.190
Which doesn't apply to our gunpowder.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.730
S-So what are we gonna do?!

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.970
That should be obvious.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.010
We attack them first.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.730
With one of our fun scientific inventions.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.710
I agree.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:23.750
Waiting will put us at a disadvantage.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.830
So the only option is to strike first!

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.400
We've gotta put that weapon of 
science together first, though.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.290
What is this weapon you're talking about?

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.810
Go ahead and cry tears of joy!

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.800
It's time to break out the real modern tech!

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.900
The scientific advancements we've 
recreated from the stone age

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.770
will finally reach all the way into modernity!

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.230
This is the stuff that won wars in modern times.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.320
The strongest weapon in two 
million years of human history...

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.990
You... don't mean nukes, do you?

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.110
Nope.

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.750
The strongest weapon in two 
million years of human history:

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.210
communications technology.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.620
We're gonna make cellular phones, 
right here in the stone world!

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.270
Cell...

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.030
...ular...

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:13.720
...phones?

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.290
Is he crazy? Because he just 
said something really crazy.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.250
A cellular phone?

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.910
What's that? Some kind of fish?

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.310
From a distance?

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.170
So you can talk to someone...

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.530
...from really far away?

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.710
That is definitely sorcery!

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.320
Is such a thing really possible?!

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.690
Oh, man! I wanna know how that works!

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.510
And that'll be our weapon?

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.820
You bet it will. Communications can 
completely turn the tide in a battle.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.450
Suppose we have a double agent 
who leaks intel to us in real time...

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.220
This is Asagiri Gen.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.970
Senku-chan, the bad guys are
wide open on the west side.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.010
Barely even any guards. Over.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.640
This is Asagiri Gen.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.420
Senku-chan, the bad guys are
wide open on the west side.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.180
Barely even any guards. Over.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.450
Now that's some exhilarating intel!

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.280
We're gonna go nuts on their western flank!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.830
If we coordinate our efforts the right way,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.280
we might be able to dismantle the 
Tsukasa Empire without bloodshed.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.890
But who would be our double agent?

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.920
They're already out there.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.550
Two of them: Taiju and Yuzuriha!

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:48.910
Smartphones!

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.330
Sure, smartphones!

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.930
Smartphones would be nice to have, huh?

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.150
Smartphones?!

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.770
You sure love your smartphone.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.000
That blockhead Taiju wanted 
a smartphone so badly,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.630
and now it's finally going to happen.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.830
Granted, this time it'll just be a 
regular phone, not the smart kind.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:19.920
We can do this!

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.920
We were able to make sulfa drugs, 
and they took a ton of work, too!

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.730
Uh, listen...

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.870
You guys clearly aren't aware of this,

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.170
but this road map is full 
of implausible things.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.560
Nothing implausible about it.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.210
No matter how far off the goal may seem,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.070
if you stick to the rules, you'll get 
there ten billion percent of the time.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.070
Copper

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.070

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:49.070
Cell Phone

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.330
That's how science works.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.040
All of Gen-kun's reports were lies.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.920
The village already has 
considerable scientific power.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.300
Senku-kun is alive.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.040
