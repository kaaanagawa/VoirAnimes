00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.820
If I let you live,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.870
you would let civilization develop.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.390
Will you promise that you won't do that?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.170
What the hell are you talking about?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.330
Why would I ever keep a promise like—

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.770
No, you would never lie.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.830
Not to science.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.100
Will you promise here and now, for all 
eternity, that you'll abandon science?

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.480
If you do, I won't have 
to kill you, Senku.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.070
I can't do that.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.330
I thought that would be your answer.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.990
Do it in one blow.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.650
Making me bleed out forever 
wouldn't be logical for either of us.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.330
Don't worry.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.100
I'll bust your cervical 
nerve in a single blow.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.280
You'll be knocked unconscious 
instantly, and then you'll die.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.940
I won't make you suffer.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.480
I promise not to miss.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.780
Taiju-kun...

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.180
Yuzuriha...

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.110
Senku!

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.420
Senku, if we'd met 3,700 years ago...

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.530
If we'd met before this planet 
became a stone world...

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.620
You may have been my first friend.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.950
Senku!

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.180
Good morning, world

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.950
How far have I walked?

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.030
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.370
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.990
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.210
Is what keeps me going today

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.080
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.100
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.950
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.280
To the ends of the world

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.830
Good morning, world

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.000
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.350
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:55.760
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.680
We'll expand our world

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.900
Senku!

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.610
Answer me!

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.820
Answer me, please!

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.150
No!

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.240
This is wrong!

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.220
It can't be!

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.800
You can't die here, Senku!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.830
There's no way!

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.940
He didn't suffer.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.090
I suggest that, as his friends, 
you give him a proper farewell.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.840
So long as Yuzuriha could be used as a 
hostage, Taiju would never attack me.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.970
That was the power dynamic.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.980
But, Taiju, if Senku's 
death were to enrage you

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.820
and drive you to attack me mindlessly...

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.410
I'd have to kill you, too.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.330
Please don't lose your head.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.940
Taiju-kun!

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.690
Don't worry, Yuzuriha.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.280
I'm calm.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.870
It seems I have no choice 
but to fight him.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.910
Sorry, Yuzuriha. If it comes to it...

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.220
It's okay, Taiju-kun.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.890
The three of us made a promise.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.890
I'm sure it'll work out.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.390
It has to.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.190
Yeah.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.270
Thanks, Yuzuriha!

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.700
Why did he throw it in the air?

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.030
The boulder is a decoy.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.310
Taiju, I can see you.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.620
No matter what you do, you've lost.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.630
Tsukasa is wary of me.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.250
He wouldn't dare take his eyes off me.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.530
But that's when I have my chance!

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.030
Tsukasa-kun's instincts would tell him 
that Taiju-kun would protect me.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.230
I think he's right, in this stone world.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.630
But like Senku-kun said...

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.570
Science levels the playing 
field for everyone!

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.470
It's black powder.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.760
Senku-kun left us...

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.130
...with science to remember him by.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.890
The three of us made a 
promise to fight together.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.030
Yuzuriha, Senku, and I...

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.550
fight alongside each other in this battle!

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.260
Goodbye, Tsukasa!

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.700
Taiju would never attack anyone.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.590
He wouldn't have expected me to 
take so much as a scrape from that.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.490
Goodbye, Tsukasa!

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.640
I see.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.190
That's right, Senku. You said it yourself!

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.120
If we need to run, we're running together!

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.860
I don't care what anyone says.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.550
I know you aren't dead!

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:19.580
You wouldn't die while you still have the 
goal of restarting civilization from scratch!

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.860
What's the point of fleeing?

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.850
I shattered his cervical nerve for sure.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.890
There's no way to revive him, especially in this stone world, with no medicine.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.540
Heart massage...

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.970
I don't even know if I'm doing it right.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.700
But I have to do it.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.400
Wait, artificial respiration?

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.160
I think you should keep his neck still!

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.950
Tsukasa-kun hit him in the neck.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.330
Senku-kun sacrificed himself for me.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.970
Senku sacrificed himself for you?

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:25.930
Magic Psychology
Asagiri Gen

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.150
Here's a psychology quiz.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.530
Suppose there's an accident,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.930
and only you, your friend, 
or your lover can be saved.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.650
What would you do?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.810
I think I'd get stuck trying to decide 
between my friend and my lover.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.890
Wouldn't you obviously choose yourself?

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.940
How could you ever choose?

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.780
What kind of nasty quiz is that?

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.490
I'd say everyone.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.820
I'd look for a fundamental rule 
that lets us all be saved.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.580
Wow! Just the kind of thing a 
science club president would say.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.360
Wait, that's allowed?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.020
That's my choice, too, then!

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.360
This psych quiz tells you who 
is the most important to you.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.630
That's ten billion percent obvious.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.720
That book's absolute trash.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.850
Senku would never kill himself.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.410
He'd never sacrifice himself, either.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.860
He would have bet on 
some way we'd all be saved.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.020
Try to remember about Senku.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.070
We're his friends. We'd know.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.740
There must be a hint!

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.370
His neck...

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:37.710
I think Senku-kun was deliberately 
inviting Tsukasa-kun to attack his neck.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.970
That thing he was doing...

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.680
That's not a habit he's always had.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.180
Why did he keep touching his 
neck and cracking it like that?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.270
There's a little bit of 
petrification left on his neck!

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:03.780
When we were removing the petrification 
on your foot, didn't Senku say...

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:08.990
that small breaks are repaired 
when the petrification is undone?

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.830
Taiju-kun, the revival fluid!

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.650
Yeah!

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.780
It might work on Senku-kun's neck, too.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.640
It might fix his neck when 
the petrification is undone.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.740
The petrification's gone!

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.320
Wake up!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.330
I know you wouldn't die in a place like this!

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.130
Senku, you're...

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.880
the star of hope for 
humanity, for civilization!

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.030
Please!

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.520
Come back!

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.700
Wake up, Senku!

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:37.780
One, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight, nine...

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.340
All right.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.770
I can make it past 800,000 seconds 
without nearly losing consciousness now.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.140
My brain's getting used to this.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:59.560
I've been frozen like this for
117,354,889,550 seconds now.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.210
In other words, it's the 3,718th spring.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:12.080
Starting in the spring is an absolute 
must if I'm going to be revived.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.110
All right, if I'm going to get up, now's the time.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.830
Get up already, me.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.090
Get up!

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.090
Get up, damn it!

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.840
Get up!

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.590
Get up!

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.740
I broke out!

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.550
I'd love to be that boisterous, but...

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.250
I'm ten billion percent sure I would've 
done that if I were a simpleton like Taiju.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.530
My first priority is to 
secure my surroundings.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:09.010
My own body is a hint that's 
worth its weight in gold.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.390
The location where I was 
lying down, my position...

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.890
The order in which the mystery 
stone fragments fell off of me...

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.540
I'm going to keep every last piece 
for when I'm ready to investigate.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.660
Yo, where you from?

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.240
Where are you from, monkey?

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.420
Dude, he's all shiny!

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.040
Gross!

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.290
That monkey's got shiny skin!

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.010
He's got his nasty peepee out, too!

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.970
So do I, actually.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.690
Gross!

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.140
Am I the first one they've seen?

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.480
It doesn't look like civilization survived.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.810
Which means I'm the first shiny 
monkey to be born on this planet.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.380
This is exhilarating.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:32.690
It's been 117,354,893,870 
seconds since I was petrified.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.110
The mental arithmetic is getting hard.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.640
The leap seconds are a pain in the ass.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.840
Not to mention, Earth is rotating

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.010
seventeen millionths of a 
second slower every year.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.650
Little numbers don't mean anything.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:57.160 line:20%
AD 5738
April 1

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.470
AD 5738, April 1st.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.160
Today is Year Zero.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.870
It all starts here.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.340
Take a look at the power of the shiny monkey.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:19.450
I'm going to build a civilization with 
enough technology to take us to space.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.900
He's been rubbing that stick this whole time.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.330
That shiny monkey's a dumb-dumb.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.690
Let's go home.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:38.900
What a moron.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.300
I'm neither a meathead like Taiju

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.780
nor an ultra-dexterous craft 
club kid like Yuzuriha.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.210
There's no way I'm going to start a fire

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.010
using a primitive hand drill 
in Japan's humidity.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.070
That's right.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.400
This shiny monkey has 
neither fangs nor claws.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.230
All I can do is improvise, one step at a time.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.610
That's exactly what civilization is.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.350
Why does he keep banging the rock like that?

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.130
That shiny monkey's definitely a dumb-dumb.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.810
There's some trick to it that I'll only 
learn through trial and error.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.060
Bash the edges off mid-air.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.770
Sharpen both sides of the edge 
by striking it on top of a surface.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.630
I have to use the right kind 
of rock for the job, too.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.110
This colorful rock, chert, is tough as hell.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.860
Nothing will work better 
for making a small knife.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.720
Learn everything.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.160
Try everything.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.050
   Shiny Monkey
   acquired
   Stone Tools!!

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.720
I can unravel this like string cheese.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.740
Now he's twisting it.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.440
I bet his brain is shiny, too.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.160
   Shiny Monkey
   acquired
   Rope!!

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.580
There are actually quite a 
few animals that use tools.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:56.090
Crows, otters, and orangutans, for example.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.090
But there's only one 
species that uses science.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:07.060
Generating heat by using the oxidation 
of the gases given off by cellulose...

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.850
In other words...

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.400
combustion!

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.150
   Shiny Monkey
   acquired
   Fire!!

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:57.480
I use ingenuity to take in everything 
the universe has to offer.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.980
I'm the master of science!

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.990
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.690
Nice to meet you.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.170
What the hell is that?!

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.380
The shiny monkey isn't shiny anymore!

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.220
I'm the only one of my kind on this planet...

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.700
a human.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.260
Acquired Food,
Clothing and Shelter!!

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.650
I'm going to build a technological 
civilization from scratch,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.350
and this is where it starts.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.540
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.030
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.850
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.780
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.220
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.730
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.860
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.740
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.460
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.930
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.550
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.880
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.940
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.510
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.880
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.010
Tell me why?

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.100
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.810
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.360
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.150
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.910
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:59.000
Two Nations of the Stone World

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.020
Next Episode

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.020
Two Nations of the Stone World
