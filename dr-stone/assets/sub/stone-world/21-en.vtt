00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.530
With gears and a waterwheel, 
the age of human power is over.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.830
With an infinite contraption 
that requires no fuel...

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.950
We're finally harnessing 
the power of nature.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.150
We're overcoming manpower and 
entering the age of energy!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.390
Hydroelectric power plant acquired!!

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.760
Wh-What is this?

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.270
It's a hydroelectric generator.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.970
Hydroelectric?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.300
Generator?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.280
This is insane, Senku-chan.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.610
Save your praise for Chrome 
and Grandpa Kaseki here.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180
They built this huge-ass waterwheel.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.680
It's not done yet, though.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.210
All our precious electricity 
is still leaking away.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.170
What does that mean?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.630
We're building a box to store the electricity.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.680
We can store that spinning power?

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.220
Yeah, although it'll be a bit of a pain to build.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.560
Get off your asses.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.010
We have a ton of high-difficulty crafting to do

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.570
before we get to our cell phones.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.420
Damn...

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.290
It's the start of our Spartan crafts club.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.040
Damn, this is exhilarating.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.010
Spartan Crafts Club

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.460
To make a box for storing electricity, 
a battery, all we need to do

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.990
is dip two sheets of lead in our old 
two-faced goddess friend, sulfuric acid.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.110
Ryu-san?

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.780
Oh, sulfuric acid.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.300
Send electricity into this, 
and it'll store power on its own.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.080
It's simpler than you'd think, huh?

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.460
It's not simple at all.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.970
This is pretty brutal.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.900
We'll make five more of these 
and connect all of them.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.920
Don't you think the crafts team has 
been working a bit too hard lately?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.420
Batteries acquired!!

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.120
Is it really being stored 
in these tiny containers?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.930
All the spinning power from those disk—

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.430
It's definitely in there.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.350
Battery

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.950
Does that mean I don't have to do all 
that painful turning with Kinro anymore?!

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.400
Yep. Never again.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.240
I told you, it's the age of energy.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.120
Hooray for energy!

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.210
I'm not surprised about lazy Ginro,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.000
but even super-diligent Kinro is excited.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.470
Turning that thing must've been really hard.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.370
It's not meant to make your lives easier.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.950
It just means we're using 
your manpower elsewhere.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.970
The fighters can focus on training.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.390
Put your back into it!

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.060
We only have a few months until the big battle.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.500
You need to be in shape to 
defeat Tsukasa and Hyoga!

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.530
This isn't the time to be 
taking a break, you two.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.210
This is way too Spartan!

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.360
Grandpa Kaseki's going to die!

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.050
There's one more vitally important 
use for the waterwheel.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.210
It's time for some fun gear-making.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.120
It'll work magic on the waterwheel's motion.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.370
Damn it. It broke again.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.750
Back to copying the designs again.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.630
The teeth on just half of the disk 
catch the top and bottom in turn,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.100
and that turns a rotational motion 
into a back-and-forth motion.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.300
These ideas humanity came 
up with are incredible.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.100
This is insane.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.240
The craftsman in me is 
getting way too excited.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.130
It's pissing me off.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.120
Here, leave the intricate work to the pro.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.520
They were so worn out when 
they saw the diagram,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.250
and now they're being all tough.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.720
I-Is this...

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.220
It's the air-blowing machine for building fires!

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.220
Level one!

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.220
Level 1

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.650
Level two!

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.230
Level 2

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.500
And finally, level three!

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.610
Level 3

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.340
This was the hardest work we had 
to do in exchange for ramen.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.920
The hellish iron-making 
work is finally mechanized!

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.050
Hooray for energy!

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.750
I told you, this doesn't 
mean you can slack off!

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.540
The non-fighters can focus 
on preparing for the winter.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.670
Everything I see, I see for the first time.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.220
This is called bottling, huh?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.260
It's the ancestor of canning.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.520
I can't believe we can preserve meat 
for the winter. I must be in heaven.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.020
What's the Spartan crafts 
club making this time?

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.860
Light bulbs.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.710
Sure, that's crazy enough.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.410
I'm starting to get used to it, though.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.310
It gets up to about 2,000 
degrees once it's lit.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.510
That makes the metal connections melt apart.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.360
We're going to have to use 
glass as a tiny adhesive.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.760
This is so intricate, it's tough even for me.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.550
Damn it! This is so hard!

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.940
What's the matter? Giving up already?

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.730
Not at all.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.120
Although my body gave up a long time ago.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.150
I always know I can count on a craftsman.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.890
Sheesh.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.750
I've lived such an easy life 
here for the past sixty years.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.900
But Senku, ever since you showed up,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.640
it's been so much harder,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.040
and so much more fun.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:08.730
Aside from a few, I bet everyone 
in the village feels the same way.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.440
Ramen

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.490
Wow.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.950
Last time we made a light, though, 
it burnt out instantly.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.110
What do we do?

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.610
What do you do to make things burn fast?

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.970
You give it a ton of air 
with a blowing machine.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.820
Like we did with the waterwheel, right?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.510
Then what do you do to 
keep things from burning?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.500
You get rid of the air?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:19.690
We use the hefty weight of mercury 
to catch the air as it falls,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.930
Air

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:19.970
Air

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.090
creating a vacuum.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:40.160
No matter how hot it gets, 
if there's no air, it won't burn.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.620
That's how it can last a long 
time without burning out.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.170
Senku, I've brought everyone here.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.980
Okay, hang on.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.860
It's almost time.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.280
Damn, it's snowing.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.930
Are we calling off the test?

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.350
No, I'd like to do it today.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.110
We're all set.

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.700
All right, let's turn it on.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.760
They're like twinkling stars!

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.450
Decorative lighting.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.260
I feel like I'm back in the modern world.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.410
It took two months to get here.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.910
That took a while.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.410
Nah, we're right on schedule, really.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.060
Hang on, is today Christmas?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.240
Oh, yeah, now that you mention it...

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.860
What a coincidence.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.030
Yeah, right.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.600
Oh, damn! I have an idea!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.010
We can go deep into the caves, 
farther than we could with torches!

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.900
'sup?

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.400
Right, with batteries and light bulbs, 
we could go ten billion times deeper.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.530
I bet there are tons of cool 
rocks deep in the caves!

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:48.990
Let's go, science spelunkers!

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.580
We're going to find some 
awesome mineral resources!

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.100
Yo, Senku, you may be way 
ahead of me in science,

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.510
but when it comes to exploring, 
I'm tens of billions of times better than you!

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.340
I'm sure. You've had years at it.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.090
What do you want?

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.170
Captain Chrome will go get it for you!

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.140
There's gotta be stuff on the cell phone 
road map that we don't have, right?

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.600
Oh, materials we're missing?

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:13.810
Nothing.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.510
There's nothing?!

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.520
We have everything we need.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.530
Thanks to our hard work in our past missions.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.980
Then is there a reason to go exploring now,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.470
when we're so short on labor?

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.720
I bet he just wants to go exploring, 
now that he has some new gear.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.660
Gulp!

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.160
Well, it would be nice to have a ton of copper.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.300
There's no telling how much we're going to 
use during our next brutal crafting session.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.000
That's it!

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.860
I got this!

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.330
Come home soon.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.800
At least by New Year's next week.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.650
So what's this brutal crafting?

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:58.020
I want to have it done by the time 
Chrome's back so we can surprise him.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.780
The next-level light bulb.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.170
The light bulb was already brutal.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.990
This sounds exciting.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.320
We're making computer eggs.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.310
The gears of electrons...

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.990
Vacuum tubes.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.620
Vacuum tubes, huh?

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.500
We're getting to the point where 
I have no idea what you're making.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.890
I mean, I do.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:30.510
I know of the name, but if you 
asked me what exactly they do...

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.380
They emit electrons at high temperatures,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.070
letting us control the direction of 
the current and make it stronger.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.640
Just think of them as the gears 
of the electricity world.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.650
It's the heart of a cell phone.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.490
This is tough work, but it's almost 
the same as making a light bulb.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.600
Yeah.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.270
But as the name suggests, it's a vacuum tube,

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.250
so we really need to get rid of all the air.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.310
So we put phosphorus on the 
filament, where it gets hot.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.920
It'll burn with heat, suck up 
all the air around it, and...

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.790
I didn't do anything.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.930
It cracked at the base.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.060
The wires are expanding...

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.070
The metal line going through the glass

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.540
expands just a little from the 
heat of burning phosphorus.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.430
That size difference of just
 a few microns broke the glass.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.560
Is that the level of intricacy we're dealing with?

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.240
What do we do, then?

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.410
Nothing ever works right 
on the first try, does it?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.630
It's nothing but trial and error.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.130
When is it ever anything else?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.860
I'm back!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.130
And I copped some copper!

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.010
No pun intended.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.290
This is just the right time for that copper.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.280
A copper tube?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:15.450
A tube will just expand inward without 
cracking the glass around it.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.120
Finally! Man, making that 
vacuum tube was hard work.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.410
Damn... The bamboo filament 
burnt out instantly.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.970
Damn it.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.070
Bamboo filaments are just fundamentally 
too weak for vacuum tubes.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:55.160
I don't get the science, but bamboo 
is too weak, is that right?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:56.940
What do we need?

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.720
If we need something tougher, I'll go find it!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.770
No...

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.340
There's nothing better in this age.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.290
These are all the minerals I 
found lying around in the caves.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:24.930
There must be something in here that's 
strong enough to hold up to the heat.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.810
This one's like a gem!

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:29.970
That's a jewel bug corpse.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.290
What about this rock? It's really dark,

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.730
but light as a feather!

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:35.810
Raccoon poop.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:36.650
Well, poop!

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.700
I guess we're stuck.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.540
After we came so far...

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.330
I'm not a rock doctor like Senku,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.260
but I've seen a lot of rocks while 
playing in the mountains and forests.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.020
I'm going to find an unusual 
rock that might be helpful

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.850
and be useful to everyone.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.140
If we can't do cell phones, 
we can't do cell phones.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.570
I don't have time to be bummed out.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.550
Think of something else.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.300
Senku-chan, wakey-wakey!

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:39.970
It's the new year.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.550
We should all watch the sunrise together.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.240
It's important to have a change 
of pace and a fresh mindset.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.060
That's my line of work, right?

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.500
Mentalists are such a pain.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.110
I-I'm coming, too!

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.720
Wait, Suika, were you going 
through rocks all night?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.980
You want to be useful too, huh, Suika?

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.330
That's right.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.150
New Year's, huh?

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:11.010
Our internal clocks are messed up 
from the petrification, though.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.660
I don't even know how old I am anymore.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.810
Think about how many days you've been alive.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.130
Why would we remember that?

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:23.970
What about you?

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.470
6,268 days.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.690
We're almost there.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.700
The sun's rising.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.300
It's blue.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.970
A gemstone...

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.140
It's pretty.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.420
Why... is it glowing?

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.830
It's called scheelite.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.460
It glows blue when exposed 
to ultraviolet light.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.620
Reactions to ultraviolet 
light are especially visible

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.800
right before the sun rises.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.450
In other words, only right now.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.960
A magic stone that glows 
just for this moment...

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.090
I've never seen anything like it.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.670
Me neither.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:45.410
It's an ultra-rare gem.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.020
You guys did an incredibly 
good job, Chrome and Suika.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.890
This stuff is used in modern filaments.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.470
Atomic number 74...

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:57.650
Tungsten!

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.260
Heat's got nothing on it.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.290
It's the strongest metal in the universe!

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.940
This small chunk won't be enough, 
but it came down the stream in the cave.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.490
There must be tons further inside.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.800
Tons of this heat-resistant 
treasure called tungsten!

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:27.650
We only have one set of 
materials left to make a light.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.350
The last member of the 
exploration team will be...
