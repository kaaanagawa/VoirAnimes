WEBVTT

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.280
We're gonna make cellular phones, 
right here in the stone world!

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.280
Granted, this time it'll just be a 
regular phone, not the smart kind.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.370
We can do this!

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.620
We were able to make sulfa drugs, 
and they took a ton of work, too!

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.570
Uh, listen...

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.590
You guys clearly aren't aware of this,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.900
but this road map is full 
of implausible things.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.130
Nothing implausible about it.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.490
No matter how far off the goal may seem,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.460
if you stick to the rules, you'll get 
there ten billion percent of the time.

Cell Phone

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.350
That's how science works.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.020
We have a few months to finish it.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.900
What do you mean?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200
That's how long we have before 
Tsukasa's full-on assault.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.780
What's your take, mentalist?

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.610
Let's see...

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.000
Thinking like Tsukasa-chan...

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.660
We control the revival fluid.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.750
The more time that passes, the greater 
our advantage in manpower. Yes.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.900
But it's Senku we're up against.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.850
If we give him too much time, 
he'll start mass-producing gunpowder.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.100
Your voice imitations are way too accurate.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.110
We'll take every precaution to 
ensure that we defeat Senku.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.700
We're going to need to divert a lot of 
manpower in preparation for the winter.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.890
Also, Hyoga, according to your information,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.570
the kingdom of science is a fortress on water.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.710
Yes.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.610
It's protected by a lake that all 
but freezes over in the winter.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.200
If they hold the fort, 
it will be difficult to attack.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.390
Our morale and food wouldn't 
outlast theirs in an encirclement.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.550
First of all...

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.370
Aren't Taiju and Yuzuriha in danger if 
Tsukasa finds out you're still alive?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.060
Won't they be killed?

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.020
That won't be an issue.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.580
Those two are potential hostages to them.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.150
They won't waste that.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.150
Is it safe to let Taiju-kun 
and Yuzuriha-kun roam free?

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.660
I'll have someone watch them.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.680
But let's continue interacting 
with them as we have

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.850
so they won't suspect anything.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.260
Even if Taiju and Yuzuriha are spies,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.670
there's no way for them to convey 
information in this world.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.810
The greater concern is a 
preemptive attack from Senku.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.760
I have Homura-kun keeping an eye on them.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.670
Although we don't have any 
means of communication, either,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.400
so there's a delay in getting information.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.750
How ironic.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.230
The importance of communication 
and information transfer

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.750
is especially important in 
such a primitive battle.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.500
The rules of the game are simple.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.250
We're going to make cell phones in order to 
take Tsukasa down with a preemptive strike.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.510
So the battle will happen right 
after the winter snow melts.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.500
Our deadline is spring.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.070
The Age of Energy

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.020
It sure makes a difference 
having so many people to help.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.660
It's all because Senku won the 
seat of the village chief.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.830
Good news indeed.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.840

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.670
We're taking on the huge task of making

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.840
cell phones in the stone world.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.810
There's a mountain of 
hurdles we need to clear.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.250
Oh, yeah!

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.900
That cell phone thing!

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.660
Tell me how it lets you talk 
to people really far away!

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.480
C'mon, tell me! Hurry up!

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.230
How does it work?!

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.020
Hurry up and tell me!

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.260
Give me some space!

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.270
You're getting way too excited.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.710
Listen up.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.800
Your voice is a vibration of air.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.660
Point that vibration at a diaphragm,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.150
and it produces a super tiny electrical 
current in rhythm with the vibration.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.820
Oh, damn!

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:14.600 line:20%
Oh, damn!

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.870
The current is way too small, 
of course, so you blow it up.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.010
For our purposes, we're using a vacuum tube.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.700
Then, we send it around 
and around in a circle,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.600
which sends it flowing 
in a wave of power.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.600 line:20%
Oh, damn!

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.270
That's called a radio wave.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.110
The listening side just 
does the exact opposite.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.290 line:20%
Oh, damn!

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.280 line:20%
Oh, damn!

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.270
O-Oh! I got about half of that!

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.570
I got none of it.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.690
This conversation's so high-IQ, 
it's making my head hurt.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.910
What exactly are we going to make first?

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.290
The first thing we're making in
our giant science project is...

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.070
a cotton candy machine.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.810
Cot...

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:50.650
...ton...

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.530
...can...

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.310
...dy?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.910
The conversation's IQ just 
dropped by, like, a hundred.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.100
Are you okay?

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.490
Making... something.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.610
New weapon?

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.760
What's this?

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.830
You put sugar crystals in 
here and spin it around.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.110
The centrifugal force pushes the 
molten sugar out through the small holes,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.050
resulting in thin strands.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.210
That makes cotton candy.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.030
But what do you think would happen 
if you used gold instead of sugar?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.950
We'll get gold threads!

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.830
Correct. Ten billion points.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.720
Oh, like the wires in electronics.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.590
The conversation's IQ is finally going back up.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.710
All right!

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.670
Let's go get the gold!

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.340
No, gold's precious.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.470
We can't afford to mess up.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.230
Let's try cotton candy first.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.140
We have to test it out.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.060
Ah, you're right.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.570
We need to taste... I mean, test it.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.370
Someone named Homura started this fire.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.330
We lost a lot of potato wine and 
mirin that was almost ready.

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.190
It was burning for a long time.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.340
Look.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.920
It's turned into chunks on 
the rims of the barrels.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.790
What are we doing with the damaged wine?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.010
This is stuff you can get by boiling 
wine and mirin for a really long time.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.650
They're sugar crystals.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.900
What's that fluffy stuff?

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.860
Man, it smells so good.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.700
It's so white, like a cloud.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:40.480
This is indescribable!

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.690
It's going to melt me to my core.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.140
It is!

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.060
Here, Father, try some.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.860
It's rather suspicious-looking.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.410
They've never had any actual candy before.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.700 line:20%
It's so good!

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.680
Yeah.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.780
It's just cotton candy, but for 
someone who's never had it before,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.800
it must be a mind-blowingly 
pleasurable drug.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.230
Gotta thank Homura-chan for 
making the materials for us

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.060
by starting that fire, huh?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.110
Gen...

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.570
Do you know what kind of woman Homura is?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.200
What's going on? Do you get 
curious about girls, too, Senku?

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.280
Do you have a thing for petite girls?

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.370
No, I don't think that's what he meant.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.040
You guys don't know Senku very well.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.120
We're being watched.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.940
All of us.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.340
By that Homura chick.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.150
I'm sure we are.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.220
She's the only one Hyoga-chan trusts.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.760
Even right now?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.670
Of course she's watching us.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:06.740
From a good distance, where she 
can see if we make any big moves,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.370
so she can chase us down 
if we were all to run away.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.070
I thought we'd just run 
away if things got bad.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.090
Not that we'd ever run away.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.950
Indeed. We have many elderly people 
who couldn't endure a move.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:27.620
There are no cowards in this village 
who would leave the elderly behind.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.580
Eep!

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.570
N-Nope!

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.910
Of course there aren't!

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.870
Well, Homura-chan respects 
Hyoga-sama like crazy.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.420
She'd never disobey him if 
he told her to watch us.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.070
So she won't cause us any 
trouble if we leave her be,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.430
but I don't think we could get 
her to switch sides or anything.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.540
Cotton Candy

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:16.350
Cotton candy?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.110
Don't worry, it's not 
poisoned or anything.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.760
Give half of it to an 
animal if you're worried.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.100
Fool. Not trying it.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.060
Hey, Senku, why did we give 
an enemy cotton candy?

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.280
If Homura's keeping an eye on us,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.660
she'll let Tsukasa know 
about the cotton candy.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.050
Sweets are crazy tempting.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.110
Some of them might 
rethink their allegiance.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.880
I see.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.670
You're as nasty as ever, Senku-chan.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.220
I mean that as a compliment, honestly.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:10.220
I'm sure he means that in 
a strategic way, too...

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.900
But I think Senku-san also just wanted

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.170
to share some candy with a girl.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.380
I think that's all he really meant.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.370
We're dealing with people so naïve that they
wouldn't even abandon a village guard.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.330
One lick... I'm dead?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.190
Surely not.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:00.910
Sweet...

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:11.030
Senkutei

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.370
P-P-Please and thank you.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.670
This cotton candy...

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.360
It's puffy and melts on my tongue,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.170
yet it has a good amount of roughness.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.600
Alas!

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.600
The inconsistency of the cotton 
is defeating the flavor's balance.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.270
I'll work harder next time!

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.810
Wait, no!

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:47.490
You just made me go along with a meme!

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.410
Who cares about how 
well-balanced cotton candy is?!

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.670
You guys got the word "meme," huh?

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.930
Was that in the Hundred Tales?

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.460
Damn it, my dad is such a joke.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.100
Do we really have so much time to waste?!

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.380
Tsukasa-kun's gonna be here 
before our phone's done!

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.370
Relax.

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.340
We're discussing a serious matter.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.640
The flavor of cotton candy?

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.880
If the cotton candy ends up 
with a bunch of clumps,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.940
so will the gold wire, right?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.940
Oh, that makes sense!

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.270
Man, good thing we tested 
with cotton candy first, huh?

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.310
Yeah.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:29.700
We have to figure out what's causing 
the clumps before we throw in the gold.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.030
We're always doing last-minute 
trial-and-error, huh?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.310
There!

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.610
Yeah.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.970
It's the moment the rope's tugged 
in the opposite direction.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.630
The rotation speed drops, 
which causes it to clump up.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.100
Is there a way to make it work 
smoothly without losing speed?

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.690
Using your brotherly bond, maybe?

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.230
That's crazy.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.150
Then let's use a stupidly long rope.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.490
Like, a kilometer long.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.730
I'll die!

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.450
How about we spin it by hand, 
like that generator over there?

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.060
That's too slow.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.990
That's what willpower's for!

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.370
Maybe if we take turns.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.380
We need people, though.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.340
We need to start preparing for winter.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.690
We can't give all our 
manpower to science work.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.890
That's always the issue, huh?

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.630
We can't use revival 
fluid to get more people.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.640
Guess we'll have to make it, then.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.730
It's a bit of work, but super craftsman 
Kaseki-sama can pull it off.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.190
We're making what revolutionized 
energy in human history...

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.690
The gear!

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.010
Kohaku's shield, just when we need it!

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.950
It's ten billion percent 
the right shape for a gear.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.260
You're using <i>that</i>?

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.490
Didn't the village chief 
give that to his daughter

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.500
Kohaku-chan to celebrate his victory?

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.200
...to his daughter Kohaku-chan?

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.890
...to his daughter Kohaku-chan?

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.890
Grand Bout victor: Kokuyo!

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:17.630
Congrats!

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.160
This is so nice.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.210
All right, you can have it.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.410
Thank you, Father!

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.490
Father!

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.650
Father!

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.060
Well, I don't mind, but...

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.060
It means a lot to Kohaku, 
since she received it from her father.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.370
So I don't know what she would say.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.540
Nah, I don't mind at all.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.370
Practicality first.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.450
So savage!

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.850
This is amazing!

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.930
It's so easy!

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.990
I only have to go in one direction, 
and I can go slowly!

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.260
I could keep going forever on my own!

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:05.640
Gear acquired!!

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.820
Can go slowly?

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.650
Forever in one direction?

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.410
It spins around and catches...

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.990
Holy crap! I have an idea!

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.250
This is gonna rock!

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.650
What's gotten into you?!

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.500
Just hear me out!

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:38.230
Right! Let's haul ass!

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.170
That's suspicious.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.390
What's Chrome up to?

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.210
He must've come up with some scheme.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.060
Let him be.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:52.860
When a boy's up to mischief, 
you're not supposed to look until he's done.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.610
We don't have time to 
be worrying about him.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.610
You're all in for hellish work.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.620
We twist these gold threads together into a
super thin wire that we'll work into a coil.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.930
And how long do we need to make it?

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.350
I'd say...

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.390
From right around here...

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.350
to that mountain!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.920
So we're relying heavily 
on manpower again.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.540
Thank goodness you became the 
village chief, huh, Senku-chan?

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.020
It's... It's done, Senku.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:22.150
We stayed up for three whole days.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.220
What is this?

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.800
I'm awesome, too, but it's this blade 
of science that's really awesome.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.010
It would have never worked if I 
didn't have this iron cutting tool.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.190
This damn thing!

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:47.530
What do you think, Senku?

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.640
Is my invention awesome or what?

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.260
This is payback for when you 
got me good with the magnet!

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.830
You can be more shocked than that.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.850
It's a waterwheel.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.280
You <i>do</i> know what it is?! Damn it!

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.470
A waterwheel?

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.140
I'd already come up with a name for it!

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.730
The Forever Spinny Cotton Candy Machine!

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.660
I like waterwheel better.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.090
Oh, I'm plenty shocked, all right.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.790
I can't believe you built something 
like this without any knowledge.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:29.320
This is a way bigger deal than an 
automatic cotton candy machine.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.610
There's something else, remember?

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.340
That thing Kinro and Ginro had been spinning.

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.270
You don't mean...

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:52.870
With gears and a waterwheel, 
the age of human power is over.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.630
With an infinite contraption 
that requires no fuel...

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.010
We're finally harnessing the power of nature.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:16.330
We're overcoming manpower and 
entering the age of energy!

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.060
Hydroelectric power plant acquired!!
