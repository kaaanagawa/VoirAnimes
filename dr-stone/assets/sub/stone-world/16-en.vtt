00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.270
Listen, all!

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:14.900
From this day forth, this man, Senku, 
is the new chief of Ishigami Village!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.780
Ishigami Village?

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.290
Yes, Senku.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.300
I've known about you for a long time.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.190
Your name is Ishigami Senku.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.100
Thanks. Everything 
finally makes sense now.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.610
If everyone on the planet was petrified, 
who first made this village?

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.200
Why do you and Kohaku clearly 
have foreign blood in you?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.120
All the mysteries are solved.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.770
No, sorry... None of it makes sense to me.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
Yeah. How does Senku happen to have 
the same name as the village?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.030
Wait, Ruri, you knew about Senku?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.760
I probably come up in your 
priestess mythology, don't I?

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.810
Yes.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.890
Mythology? You mean like Momotaro 
with the gorilla and all that?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.800
No wonder you people 
know about folk tales

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.610
and giant animals you would 
never have seen before.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.990
Yeah, Ruri-nee taught us 
about all kinds of things.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.180
The stories the priestess uses to pass 
down knowledge to the next generation,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.650
the Hundred Tales.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.250
Ruri.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.070
This last story, the hundredth,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.260
is believed to be a true story that 
happened a long, long time ago.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.610
The story my mother told me 
was very powerful, and very kind.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.770
The hundredth story of the Hundred Tales.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.280
Its title is...

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.740
"Ishigami Senku."

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.040
A Tale for the Ages

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.990
Why do you keep following me, Moon?

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.530
Even if I juke it really hard, it follows 
me ten billion percent of the time.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.450
Ever since he was very young, the boy, 
Senku, showed interest in anything strange.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.210
Maybe it has a crush on you, Senku.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.080
I don't need that crap right now.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.420
I'm talking serious science.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.870
What kind of preschooler are you?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.170
The reason the Moon looks 
like it's following you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.680
is because it's super-duper far away.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.530
It's especially far away for me, 
since I failed the astronaut exam.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.940
I don't care about your wistful 
poetry right now, either.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.400
My leg cramped up in the middle 
of the clothed swimming exam.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.740
I was never a good swimmer to begin with.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.450
That was rough.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.910
When's the next time they'll 
be recruiting astronauts?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.630
Who knows?

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.840
It's something like once per decade.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.840
I'm going to space.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.420
An astronaut!

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.770
What I want to become

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.550
That's a great dream.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.140
Well, when you grow up...

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.770
No, I'm going immediately.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.770
Senku loves space as much as I do,

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.770
but he thinks for himself and 
builds things for himself.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.400
He was thoroughly hooked on 
the fascination of science.

My hand's moving on its own!

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.030
What the heck?!

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.770
Of course it is.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.500
I'm sending electricity 
straight into the muscles.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.110
What is this weird suit?

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.440
My limbs are twitching and doing 
breaststrokes on their own!

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.860
The clothed swimming test is your 
biggest issue with the exam, right?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.970
We'll pound the motions into your muscles

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.250

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.790
I can't swim in this thing!

He made that crazy suit himself? 
In fifth grade?

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.710
So was it actually useful?

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.300
Of course not.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.660
I figured.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.090
Though...

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.960
Senku made it just for me.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.140
I <i>had</i> to swim in it, even if it killed me.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.220
In the end, I managed to make it 
through the clothed swimming test,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.090
and I made it here to the interview.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.680
I'm going to become an astronaut and 
go into space, no matter what.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.570
And I'm going to work for science.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.380
That's the only way I can repay Senku.

Senku, knowing you,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.120
you probably aren't watching the 
broadcast, but just in case...

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.760

The man who started the first

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.880
was Ishigami Byakuya.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.960
Welcome to the 
International Space Station!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.020
Y-You've had a long journey.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.850
Pleasure to work with you.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.690
Sorry about my husband.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.480
He's got a huge voice for 
someone with no balls.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.470
I'm Ishigami Byakuya.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.290
This is Shamil.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.320
Nice to meet you.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.790
Why are these hallways so narrow?

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.750
I'm not the same as y'all.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.170
I spent 50 million dollars 
to buy a seat in the Soyuz.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.960
I'm a space tourist, I'll have you know.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:11:00.180
And this is how you greet me, Diva Lillian?

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.310
Don't tell me you don't know me!

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.610
N-No, of course I do.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.260
I even have your CDs.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.180
Then you get it, don't you?

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.180
I do.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.310
C-Calm down.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.900
Do you really?

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.200
Why are you laughing, Byakuya?

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.240
I could have kept it up a while longer.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.640
Jeez!

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.460
Sorry, it was just so bad.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.520
Who even talks like that?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.260
What a way to start our stay.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.460
Stop laughing and make her stop, old man.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.260
I'm truly sorry, everyone.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.690
I'm Lillian Weinberg.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.710
I look forward to this coming week.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.720
I'll try my best not to get in the way.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.410
I thought the next week was going to be hell.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.810
You got us good.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:59.110
If you were being serious, one more 
minute and I would have killed you.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.950
I'm Dalia. Nice to meet you.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.370
That trembling giant over 
there is my husband, Yakov.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.470
I thought I was going to have a heart attack.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.730
Dalia and I were both doctors.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.890
Talk to us if you ever feel sick.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.960
That's reassuring. Thank you.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.580
Yakov's good to have around.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.250
It's his second time in space, after all.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.930
He's a bit of a wimp, but he's a veteran.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:28.990
Why are you acting like 
<i>you're</i> such a hotshot?

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.890
Knock it off, old man.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.250
I'm kind of a big deal.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.670
You, too. Don't get full of yourself.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.400
The girl behind him is Connie.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.250
She was a staffer at NASA.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.300
I-I'm...

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:52.410
I'm a <i>huge</i> fan of yours, Lillian-san!

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.150
Huh?

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.500
That came out of nowhere, Connie.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.290
Um...

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.980
That's all.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.300
Come on, Connie-chan.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.850
Get in there and demand an autograph.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.220
Go on!

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.050
May I... have your... autograph?

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.520
Sure, of course.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.910
Thank you!

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.570
Did you see my assist?!

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.720
Well, I guess it's time to set the stage 
for a proper greeting for Diva Lillian,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.380
who spent 50 million to get here.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.270
This'll be our background music 
for the rest of the trip.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.620
Agreed!

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.400
Let's play it at least a hundred times a day.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.620
No! Please, no! That's too embarrassing!

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.800
I'm sorry, I really am!

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.180
That concludes my mini-concert in space.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.810
I'm not masochistic enough 
to want to sing live

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.320
in front of my astronaut buddies,

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.370
so you'll have to let me off the hook now.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.770
See you, fans!

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.280
Aren't y'all going to use the 
comms, Shamil and Byakuya?

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.320
To contact your family or anything?

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.180
No need.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.870
I don't have family.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.050
What about you, Byakuya?

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.770
I have a son named Senku,

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.950
but he's a bratty kid, like Shamil here.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.760
He has no interest in staying in touch.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.130
He's probably focused on his 
research right about now.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.140
The distribution of posts 
about stone swallow figures

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.180
being found around the 
world is proportional

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.060
to the distribution of 
swallow populations.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.560
Calculating statistical 
significance would be overkill.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.820
Which means these stone figures are 
real swallows that have been petrified.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:15.340
Swallows being petrified 
all over the world?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.910
That's so insane, it's hilarious.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.450
This is exhilarating.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.590
Can't sleep?

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.260
Sorry, was I too loud?

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.550
So loud, my eardrums popped.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.850
Sorry about that.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.480
You really like singing, huh?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.980
I've been singing my whole life.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.690
Since you were a kid?

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.610
I picked up a record in the trash one day.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.410
I've been listening to songs every day since.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.710
Then, one day, my record player broke down.

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.650
After that, I started singing for myself.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.070
Singing was just so much fun.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:19.770
I want all kinds of people from 
all around the world to hear me sing.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:26.160
If it makes people appreciate the world 
and feel glad they were born,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.140
that would make me so happy.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.440
Just as I felt back then...

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.290
Sorry about that.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.570
This is seriously embarrassing.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.740
Hey...

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.040
Would you mind letting Senku 
hear you sing someday, too?

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.420
Of course.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.770
Hey!

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.490
I'm miso soup!

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:01.570
Help me!

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.500
I don't want to get eaten!

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.500
Whew, I'm flying!

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.620
Zero gravity!

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:07.980
I'm free!

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.890
Oh, no, you don't!

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.540
What are you doing?

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.780
Want to try some Japanese, Shamil?

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.240
This nutrient jelly is enough for me.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.100
For every meal?!

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.210
D-Don't you get tired of it?

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.250
Here.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.630
What's that? Noodles?

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.630
It's ramen that I had custom-made.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.140
It's the same taste you can get at the 
popular spot my son Senku and I frequented.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.180
I don't deny that you have good 
taste, but you're pampering us.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.240
The Space Agency people are here to work.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.280
Humans don't need to have fun to survive.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.670
Come on, just try it.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.780
It'll shock you.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.140
See?

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.650
Isn't it scary good?

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.930
Really? Can I try some?

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.760
No...

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.680
Look.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.150
Outside the window.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.650
At Earth.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.540
Senku!

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.520
Why?!

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.500
I can't get in touch with 
either NASA or Roscosmos!

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.370
Is it broken?

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.190
No, no one's responding.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.360
N-No one's responding over 
amateur radio, either.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.020
That light...

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.850
Something must have happened on the surface.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.190
Something terrible.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.020
L-Like a nuclear war?

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.710
Don't even talk like that!

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.870
Yes!

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.100
The Internet works.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.340
Is anyone tweeting about the situation?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.690
No good.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.310
Everyone around the world stopped 
posting at the same time.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.020
I know! The live cameras!

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.390
There!

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.450
What the hell is this?

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.090
Statues?

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.950
Is this even possible?

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.030
Oh, God...

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.840
We shouldn't do anything rash.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.660
Let's wait here.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.200
There are seven billion 
humans on the planet.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.460
Let's wait for the survivors to contact us.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.930
They'll help us!

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.030
Wait for how long?

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:38.110
A month?

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.060
Two months?

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.720
With humanity in this state,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.450
we don't have any hope of 
a rescue out here in space.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.660
Let's go back to Earth.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.980
What are you talking about, Byakuya?!

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.880
I told you, there are seven billion people!

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.580
Someone will come help us!

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.590
No, Yakov.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:08.070
We're the last six humans.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.280
Wait for help?

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.670
You're wrong.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.750
We're going to help <i>them</i>.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.010
All seven billion humans.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.000
