WEBVTT

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.950
Welcome back!

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.650
We made it past the biggest hurdle!

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.330
We got sulfuric acid!

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.330
Then, at last, we can make 
the drug to save Ruri-nee?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.850
Have some patience.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.420
Didn't you see that crazy 
roadmap to the cure-all drug?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.820
That incredibly long one?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.710
It's not that bad.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.700
We have just about 
everything we need now.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.100
We have all the necessary materials.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.990
Now it's just a matter of lighting up

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020
Iron

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020
Acetic Anhydride

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.020

Cure-all
Sulfa Drugs

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.020
all the dark spots on the roadmap, one by one.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.840
Let's plow through it today.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.660
Time for mad chemical cooking!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.080
It's gonna be exhilarating!

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.220
Good morning, world

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.430
Good Morning World!

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.430
Good Morning World!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.990
How far have I walked?

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.070
Only the pain in my feet

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.410
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.030
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.250
Is what keeps me going today

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.120
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.140
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.990
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
To the ends of the world

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.870
Good morning, world

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.950
Good Morning World!

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.950
Good Morning World!

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.040
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.390
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.800
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.720
We'll expand our world

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.040
Masked Warrior

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.820
First, we boil the sulfuric acid 
we got, and add a pinch of salt.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.730
There's a weird glass sculpture 
with a stick in the middle.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.470
How dare you make me make 
such a complicated thing?!

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.310
I don't know what you're using it for, 
but you've gone and made me all excited!

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.870
It's a water dripping machine.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.430
Are we catching the gas 
that's coming out of the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.400
sulfuric acid and salt mixture as it drips?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.860
Hydrochloric Acid

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.810
Now we've got hydrochloric acid.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.140
Hydrochloric acid?

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.400
It's a somewhat dangerous chemical.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.620
Get it in your eyes, and you'll go blind.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.260
Next, the sinters from the sulfuric acid spring,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.790
which people love taking 
home from hot springs.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.050
Boil this stuff, throw it into the 
hydrochloric acid we just made, and...

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.420
Chlorosulfuric Acid

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.890
Now we have chlorosulfuric acid.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.880
Chlorosulfuric acid?

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.700
This stuff is <i>really</i> dangerous.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.760
Get it on your skin, and you'll 
turn into a skulking zombie.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.060
Good.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.980
Man, it smells like a swimming pool.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.610
Separate the salt water 
using electricity, and...

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.980
Sodium Hydroxide

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.610
We have sodium hydroxide.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.330
Sodium hydroxide?

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.450
This chemical is <i>ultra</i> dangerous.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.870
The yakuza use it to melt corpses.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.200
Ah, I see, I see.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.530
A drug that makes you blind, turns you 
into a zombie, and melts your corpse.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.290
I see.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.290
You're going to make 
Ruri-nee drink that?

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.700
No one's drinking it!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.880
We're using it to prepare the drug!

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.600
Don't worry.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.830
The rest of the chemicals are harmless.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.490
Let's go get some ammonia.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.270
Woo!

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.930
Ammonia?

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.020
We have ammonia.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.940
Urine

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.940
(Ammonia)

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.410
And you're going to make 
Ruri-nee drink that?

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.120
She's not drinking it, damn it!

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.200
We're using it to prepare the drug!

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370
Iron

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370
Alcohol

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370
Electricity

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370
Ammonia

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.370
Cure-all
Sulfa Drugs

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.370
All right, we're getting there.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.940
We're more or less down to three items.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Alcohol

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Vinegar

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Sodium
Bicarbonate

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Coal

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Aniline

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Carbonic Acid

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Acetic Anhydride

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Powerful
Magnets

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Copper

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Phosphorus

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:37.580
Sodium
Hydroxide

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.190
Acetic anhydride, sodium 
bicarbonate, and anilin.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.580
It all sounds like some kind of spell.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.160
We can't make any of it without alcohol.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.340
Put another way, if we 
just get some alcohol...

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.260
We'll have the ultimate 
cure-all, sulfa drugs.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.090
Let's start making alcohol, then!

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.980
It's going to be a bit of a pain.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
We can use all the help we can get.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.990
Alcohol?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.450
What are you talking about?

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.620
If you win the Grand Bout tomorrow,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.780
the villagers will give you 
more than you can ever finish.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.710
Wait, the Grand Bout is tomorrow?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.080
The timing is too perfect.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.690
Yeah.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.250
If Kinro or Ginro wins, we'll have alcohol,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.960
and we can give Ruri the cure-all drug!

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.750
Yeah.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.220
We're going to win the 
Grand Bout, even if it kills us.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.540
It's finally time.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.430
Your husband, the new village 
chief, will be chosen tomorrow.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.290
Isn't that right, Ruri?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.030
Yes.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.170
Turquoise!

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.460
Are preparations for the 
Grand Bout proceeding well?

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.540
Yes.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.690
Well, yes...

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.890
The preparations are, at least.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.450
That said...

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.770
Why is Kohaku competing again?!

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.750
You need to tell her she can't!

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.950
Anyone over fourteen and not 
yet married can participate.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.920
The sacred rules of the 
Grand Bout are immutable.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.800
No one expected a girl to compete!

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.450
Well, let's let it be.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.180
A man who can't even defeat a woman isn't fit

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.220
to fill the seat of the village chief, anyway.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.970
Chief, there's actually one more problem.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.950
Hm?

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.900
There's a new contestant.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.650
You're participating in the Grand Bout?!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.660
I signed him up!

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.490
Senku's over fourteen and 
unmarried, after all!

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.040
Yeah, there's no rule that says 
you have to be a villager.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.590
Since when have Senku 
and Ginro been so close?

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.960
Their skeevy sides 
brought them together.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.090
But, Senku, you aren't a very capable fighter.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.130
I don't plan on winning.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.660
I just want to tire them out.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.020
Plus, if we go up against each other...

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.210
Boop.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.520
Oh, no, you got me!

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.850
We move up without breaking a sweat!

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.300
The more contestants on our 
side, the better! Right?!

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.310
Y-You're rigging the game.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.950
You're way too underhanded, Ginro.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.040
Either way, even with worthy 
goals, rules are rules.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.210
I'm not going to lose on 
purpose to rig the game.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.130
Of course, of course!

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.620
You look like the best bet to win 
against Magma anyway, Kinro.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.840
Save your energy and make it to the top.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.460
You don't need to cheat, Kinro.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.020
We're just going to be all like, "Mercy!"

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.350
Got a problem with that?

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.110
Neither of you look very righteous.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.280
Kohaku! What about you?

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.070
Are you fine with tarnishing 
the game by rigging it?

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.780
Anti

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.780
Pro

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.010
Well, I mean...

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.530
Rigging

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.530
Anti

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.530
Pro

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.040
If it improves Ruri-nee's chances 
of surviving, even just a little...

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.240
It's been nearly half a year since he arrived.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.550
Finally...

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.170
I'm setting foot in the 
village for the first time.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.090
This is the first step.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.810
Is that the outsider who 
wants to enter the Grand Bout?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.390
Yes.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.730
His name is Senku.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.460
Senku?

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.520
Did you say his name is Senku?

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.820
What, have you met him 
before or something, Ruri?

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.590
No, I haven't.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.740
Of course I haven't, but...

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.490
I still know...

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.830
I still know Senku.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:25.830
Hey!

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.670
For years...

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.230
No, possibly even from long, 
long ago in the past.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.780
Senku-san, right?

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.630
So you're the priestess, Ruri.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:43.930
We finally meet, huh?

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.440
There's something I must ask you.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.320
Senku, what is your last name?

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.540
Last...

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.570
...name?

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.740
Your last name is another 
name that attaches to—

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.580
Yeah, I know what it is.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.850
There's no culture of having 
last names in this village.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.540
How does this woman know?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.550
Could it be that you're Ishi—

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.500
Ruri-sama!

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.340
Outsider!

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.970
Stay away from the priestess!

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.520
Don't make her walk!

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.010
Carry her back immediately!

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.240
Are you all right?

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.430
Yes.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.730
I have a ton of questions, too.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.180
Let's have a good, long interview 
once the Grand Bout is over with.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.970
This is excellent.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.410
I might not need to kill Ruri.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.520
It looks like she'll croak 
as soon as we get married.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.900
Anyone but you, Magma!

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.390
Hey, that's not bad form for Chrome.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.640
Chrome's been practicing 
poking that target non-stop.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.020
I'm practicing hitting Magma's weak spot.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.850
His weak spot? You don't mean...

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.020
Yep! His wee-wee!

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.820
I agree.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.980
If the goal is to wear him down, 
then it makes sense to go for his testicles.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.360
Kohaku-chan...

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.430
You're beyond tomboy or butch 
when it comes to fighting.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.790
You're simply... insane.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.380
I don't have a chance of winning,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.090
but I'm going to chip away at 
Magma as much as I can before

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.570
Kinro or someone else goes up against him.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.630
That's the best I can do.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.550
That means the match-up is going to be crucial.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.590
Rig it! Rig it!

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.890
Make a match-up that'll let us rig it!

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.340 line:20%
Rig it! Rig it!

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.340
Yup, screw having a fair fight.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:56.270
The kingdom of science fights 
with wits and genius.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.700 line:20%
Make a match-up that'll let us rig it!

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.440
Let's game the Grand Bout to hell and back.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.410
We'll rig it so that Kinro 
gets to the top unscathed,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:05.900
and pit him against an exhausted Magma.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.080
Which means it's best for us if Kinro 
and Magma are in separate blocks.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.690
Although it'll be quickest if I can 
defeat Magma in the first match.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.770
Right.

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.880
If you win in the finals, it all gets reset.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.630
When it comes to drawing straws, 
all we can do is pray to God.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.530
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.470
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.500
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.890 line:20%
It sounds like a tongue twister.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.390
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.350 line:20%
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together!

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.750 line:20%
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other!

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.480
They're drawing up the 
tournament brackets.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.260 line:20%
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.560 line:20%
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other!

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.300
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.980
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other!

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.870
Kohaku-chan and Magma 
start off together!

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.060
Kinro and Magma never 
go against each other!

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.660
The first round of the 
Grand Bout will be between...

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.040
Kinro and Magma!

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.050
This is bad.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.930
This is really bad.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.140
This is seriously bad!

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.170
It turned out the exact 
opposite of what I prayed for!

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.090
Damn it, how could we be so unlucky?

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.310
What can you do?

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.620
A science user doesn't count on being lucky.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.860
You just do what you can, 
even if you're dealt the worst cards.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.530
A rigged Grand Bout is won by doping,

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.120
with this Kingdom special 
science power-up drink!

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.200
That's another mighty suspicious drink.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.830
Does it have some kind 
of crazy drug in it?

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.960
Sadly, it's perfectly safe.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.630
It's made from tea leaves, 
honey, and sweet flag.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.190
The caffeine's a stimulant, 
the sweet flag will keep you cool,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.530
and the honey will jack your 
blood sugar through the roof.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.570
In this stone world, 
that's nothing short of doping.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.510
Who said to drink <i>all</i> of it?!

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.270
We're all out?!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.890
What do you want me to do?!

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.280
If you lose to Magma, 
<i>I'm</i> going to have to beat him!

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.870
He ate the ingredients raw.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.030
Dude, he finished all the sweet flag.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.730
Is that the grass that's 
growing all over the river?

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.540
I'll go pick some!

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.420
I may not be competing, but I 
can still make myself useful!

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:39.460
But, hey, I just need <i>you</i> to make 
it to the final match, right?

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.440
This is bad!

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.890
Suika-chan fell in the river 
trying to pick herbs!

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.150
She's drowning!

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:54.100
You're the quickest, Kohaku-chan, 
so you'd better go help her before she dies!

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.750
You're ten billion percent lying, obviously.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.950
I-I'm not lying.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.880
I just <i>happened</i> to pass by her 
at the river when I saw her!

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.700
How do you know she 
was there to pick herbs

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.430
if you just "happened" to see her at the river?

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.680
Come back in ten billion years if 
you want to have a brain battle

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.220
with the science team, you blatant idiot.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.950
I know he's lying,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.000
but if there's even the slightest 
chance that he's not,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.650
I'd be letting Suika die.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.490
Kohaku, you're our last stand against Magma.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.940
If you bail now...

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.010
But I'm the only one who can 
save her. I'm the fastest.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.580
I know he's lying, but I 
have to go to the river.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.310
You're a despicable man, Mantle.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.590
Kohaku!

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.060
N-No way!

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.860
Round one: Kinro! Magma!

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.190
Forward!

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.190
Yeah, but Kohaku went to save Suika.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:13.110
If Kohaku doesn't return in time for her 
match in round three, she'll be disqualified.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.530
Damn it!

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.940
Get back quick, Kohaku!

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.850
Good going, Mantle.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.060
Yeah!

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.080
I had to make doubly sure.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.180
Now that Kohaku is gone, 
there's no one who can defeat me.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:34.960
I, Magma-sama, will be the next 
village chief and Ruri's husband.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.280
Kinro!

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.340
If you surrender now, 
I'll make you my right-hand man.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.640
I don't dislike strong men.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.640
Lick my shoes in front of 
everyone, here and now!

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.570
I'll take that as your pledge.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:00.540
Magma, even if what you say is 
true, I would never surrender.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.450
Even in the midst of 
this corrupt Grand Bout,

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.330
I'm incapable of fighting 
except in earnest.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:12.860
Not only that, but I'm not 
the same man I was before.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.550
You've never won against me once!

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.470
What could possibly be different?

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.470
I...

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.490
I have no choice but 
to win, for my friends!

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.160
Round one: Magma versus Kinro.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.020
Begin!

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:39.370
Your filthy greed is nothing 
compared to what motivates me!

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.710
Kinro, when did you become so strong?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.230
Wow, he's evenly matched with Magma.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.670
He might have a chance!

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.770
Huh, he's doing ten billion percent 
better than I thought he would.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.940
This is all thanks to our 
battle team's training.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.680
Why are <i>you</i> getting so smug, Ginro?

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.610
If worse comes to worst...

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.390
Hey, Mantle.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.710
Jasper's an insanely good referee.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.150
He won't let you get away with that.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.220
You got this, Kinro!

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.160
Not direct

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.160
Direct attacks
from outsiders

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.640
Yeah!

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.090
I was just, y'know...

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.710
Click, click!

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.920
Clicking rocks together to cheer him on.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.950
Nuts.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.300
Mantle tied it so tight, I can't get free.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.940
I have to get back to the others, quick!

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.870
Magma took a step back.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.870
He always just goes by brute force.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.300
Magma's serious.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.790
I've never seen him like that.

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.150
This is bad.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.040
He's put distance between us.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.170
Kinro's straining his eyes.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.170
Suika! You're safe!

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.420
So he <i>was</i> lying about you drowning.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.690
Damn that Mantle!

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.130
Kinro probably has the 
fuzzy sickness in his eyes.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.820
I can tell because I have it, too.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.450
What was that jab?

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.040
It didn't even come close.

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.890
Shit, that was a direct hit!

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.090
Kinro!

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.710
It's no use.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.740
I can't move.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.660
No...

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.740
Not yet.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.530
What I'm doing is important.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:26.500
Suika?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.460
How did you get in here?

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.000
I'm finally going to really, 
really put myself to use!

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.650
Still not giving up, Kinro?

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.990
I like you even more.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.510
I want you to be my henchman.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.090
I'm going to use this hill to gain speed!

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.760
Now, lick my shoes!

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.150
It's the eyes of science, Kinro!

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.840
Who the hell is that creep?!

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.800
What's the deal with that goofy mask?

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.820
My vision...

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.890
So this is science!

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.510
Holy crap!

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.730
He's dodging each one, just barely!

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.700
Wh-What's going on with you?

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:54.290
I'm grateful for the science, Suika, Senku.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.470
Let me teach you, Magma...

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.830
Had science helped me conquer my eyes,

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:15.060
I would have surpassed your strength long ago.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.580
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.070
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.890
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.820
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.260
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.770
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.900
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.780
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.500
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.970
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.590
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.920
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.980
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.550
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:24.920
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.050
Tell me why?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.140
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.850
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.400
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.190
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.950
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040
Next Time

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.250
