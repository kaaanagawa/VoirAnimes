00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.820
Someone from outside the village?

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.150
It's that criminal who got kicked 
out of the village a long time ago.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.240
Who else could it be?

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.740
Maybe the stone statue people 
have started moving.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.150
No way.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.920
It surely wasn't Kohaku who 
brought that foreigner in, was it?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.100
We don't know yet.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.660
No, it was.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.230
It was Kohaku-chan.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.180
Jasper, you heard what Ginro said.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.760
Don't tell such obvious lies for her.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.750
That fool!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.980
I've disowned her, and she 
still doesn't obey the rules.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.860
Damn it.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.770
Ruri!

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.120
Tell me, Senku.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720
How do we make the cure-all medicine?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.750
We're going to defeat Ruri's sickness!

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.670
I'll help in any way I can, if it 
means Ruri-nee will get better!

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.320
Ruri-sama!

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.190
I'm so worried.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.330
She's not sick anymore!

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.940
Hooray for science!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.060
I'm going to join the kingdom of science!

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.140
I see what he's thinking.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.930
He's planning to save Ruri as 
part of some sleazy scheme.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.580
I can't decide if he's a 
gentleman or a slimeball.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.360
I guess he's just logical, but...

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.300
The kingdom of science is going 
to be making an antibiotic.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.910
It's the scientific wonder drug that 
kills bacteria infecting a person.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.900
It's saved hundreds of millions of lives

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.420
ever since it was discovered 
in the early twentieth century.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.610
We can't do blood tests.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.770
We have no idea what her disease even is.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.760
But it's worth trying it anyway.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.730
All right, let's get on it right away!

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.430
What do we need?

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.780
We're missing all kinds of stuff.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.060
Pay attention when I talk.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.300
There are two routes to making antibiotics.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.800
We can take the biological route and 
make penicillin from living things,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.280
Sulfa Drug

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.280
Penicillin

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.740
or we can take the stone route 
and make sulfa drugs from rocks.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.280
Hang on, Senku.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.790
Living things? Rocks?

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.580
How would you make medicine from those?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.690
Penicillin, made from green mold,
is the more famous one.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.310
But making penicillin in this stone world 
would be a crazy game of chance,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.420
where we'd be going, "Hey, we managed 
to stumble upon this super green mold

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.860
that's ten billion times more powerful, woo!"

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.810
Woo!

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.160
We'll just have to pray,

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.430
"Please, Lord, give us some of 
that nice green mold, thanks!"

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.530
Meanwhile, the stone route, 
making sulfa drugs,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.750
will take insane amounts 
of diligence and manpower,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.990
but even in this stone world, 
we'll land on the drug, ten billion percent.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.650
Then the answer is obvious!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.430
You get it, don't you?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.220
We're neither gods nor geniuses.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.170
We crawl around on the ground, 
making everything step by step.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.800
We're taking the stone route.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.810
We'll get each of these things one by one

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.260
and warp right through two million 
years of science history.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.550
This is the science roadmap to the cure-all.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Iron

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Alcohol

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Electricity

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Vinegar

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Sodium
Bicarbonate

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Salt

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Sulfuric
Acid

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Urine

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Powerful
Magnets

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Copper

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Phosphorus

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Sodium
Hydroxide

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Sodium
Hydrogen Sulfate

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Coal

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Aniline

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Chlorosulfuric Acid

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Hydrochloric Acid

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Carbonic Acid

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Acetic Anhydride

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Ammonia

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.030
Cure-all
Sulfa Drugs

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.170
Oh, damn, man!

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.860
Let's start with this "iron" stuff, then.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.170
Wait, what <i>is</i> iron, anyway?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.130
Teach me everything.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.300
Iron isn't going to be that easy.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.980
Senku-sensei's sorcery 
science classes, huh?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.850
I don't think I could even keep up.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.480
Are you serious?! Damn!

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.170
The planet's the one that's moving?! Dude!

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.190
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.050
That doesn't make sense.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.410
Why am I not being flung 
off this branch, then?

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.830
Because there's gravity.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.990
I always thought it was weird.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.410
Some of the stars don't move at all.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.410
That's the North Star.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.410
It's a ridiculously useful star that's 
ten billion percent true north.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.630
Remember that.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.770
Oh, is it?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.840
It seems slightly off from true north.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.100
It can't be. It's within the margin of error—

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.930
Earth's axis is shifting!

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.020
The whole planet has tilted slightly 
over the past 3,700 years.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.910
It's currently AD 5,739.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.820
The North Star's moved!

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.990
No wonder my GPS screwed up and 
got me lost on my way to Hakone.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.090
A true scientist would laugh at me.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.370
How could I not have seen that?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.790
You guys are way more observant because 
you have no preconceived notions.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.210
I'm such a loser.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.090
You don't seem like a loser to me, Senku.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.180
I'm not saying that to put myself down.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.280
I think of myself as being so rational,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.890
but I couldn't keep up on 
this scale. That's all.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.210
3,700 years.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.900
It never hit me until now 
how insanely long that is.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.700
Wait, how did you know that the 
ex-North Star isn't true north?

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.500
So even the great Senku 
doesn't know about this rock!

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.830
This crazy rock that I happened 
to find on a bald mountain!

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.710
For some reason, when you hang it or 
float it, it always points straight north!

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.300
Isn't that nuts?

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.250
It's a magnet.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.430
You know of it?! Damn it!

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.250
Good going, Chrome.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.390
If we have magnets...

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.770
Look at how much it picked up.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.580
All this suspicious black sand!

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.080
We're finally taking the first step on 
the road to the kingdom of science.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.580
Iron

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.580
The curtain is rising on the age of iron!

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.590
Now that's exhilarating.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.750
Seriously, though, that lioness...

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.450
Is everyone in your village like that?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.580
We have a few brute strength gorillas,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.740
but Kohaku's the only agile gorilla.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.350
I said I'm not a gorilla!

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.350
Also, I'm doing all the collecting here!

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.900
Why don't you guys get off your 
asses and do some work, too?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.230
We don't have enough manpower!

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.430
Sorry.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.740
Acquired iron sand!!

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.490
She's right, though. 
This is going to take all day.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.820
Should I get someone from 
the village to help out?

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.790
As far as the villagers know, 
you two are both suspicious sorcerers.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.750
Sadly, no one's going to come help.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.920
A watermelon?

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.530
It's Suika.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.870
Why are you here?

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.100
Did you follow us here?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.950
Her name is Suika?

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.550
It's a nickname, probably.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.030
She's always wearing a watermelon rind.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.160
Hey, Suika! you took my magnet!

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.700
Iron sand.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.350
I want to help.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.960
I can never make myself useful to anyone 
because I have this thing on my head.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.760
That's not going to change 
even when I grow up.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.440
So if there's ever anyone in need...

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.350
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.100
I appreciate it.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.410
The kingdom of science 
doesn't turn anyone away.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.490
We need all the help we can get.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.450
A shrimp like you would be ten billion 
times better at gathering sand.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.690
We're counting on you, Suika.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:10.290
He's the first person to not ask me 
why I'm wearing this on my head.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.930
He must have thought I don't want anyone 
to see my face, so he's being nice.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.460
You really don't know Senku. 
You're glorifying him too much.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.680
He just doesn't care what you look 
like, as long as you're useful.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.890
I'm going to gather all the iron sand!

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.330
Donburako, donburako...

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.270
Who are you, Momotaro?!

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.180
Don't drown!

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.790
You don't know <i>Dragon Quest</i> or <i>Monster Hunter</i>, but you do know <i>Momotaro</i>?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.950
Who taught you?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.130
Hey, you know Momotaro, too?

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.950
Ruri-nee told us all about him.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.940
Come to think of it, 
why do you know about gorillas?

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.330
Are they out in the wild?

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.970
I've never actually seen one.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.860
But there's a gorilla in <i>Momotaro</i>, isn't there?

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.130
No, there isn't!

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.550
He used millet dumplings 
to win friends, remember?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.250
A bear, a lion, a gorilla, and an alligator.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.640
What kind of wild-ass Momotaro is that?!

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.310
Was it meant to be an easy-to-understand 
story to teach about dangerous animals?

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.660
I heard all kinds of stories 
from Ruri-nee, too.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.160
Come to think of it, I think I learned 
all my big words from Ruri-nee, too.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.640
Ruri...

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.790
Just who are you?

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.870
I'm low-key interested in this Ruri chick.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.630
We really need to make the cure-all
and save her, whatever it takes.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.420
What do you mean, you're interested in Ruri?

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.800
What does that mean, Senku?

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.970
Senku, Senku, Senku-sensei...

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.890
Chrome seems to have a crush on Ruri-nee.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.950
So that's what it was.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.600
Here we go.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.830
And Chrome's such a child.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.180
I like how oblivious he is.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.900
What are you guys talking about?!

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.910
Damn it, who are you calling a child?!

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.660
So the black sand we got from the 
river turns into this "iron" stuff?

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.550
Yeah.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.910
Mix four parts iron sand 
to one part coal, and bake.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.210
Hey, that's easy.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.800
It's harder than it sounds.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.630
It's not like making clay pots.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.930
The highest temperature we can get
by burning wood is 700 degrees.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:31.620
But ironmaking, turning iron sand 
into iron, requires 1,500 degrees.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.980
That's not even close to enough.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.540
What do we do?

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.190
We blow like hell.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.060
We have to give it as much oxygen as we can.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.070
We'll send in a ton of air

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:48.240
and double the flame's damage 
output from 700 to 1,500.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.280
This thing blows air?

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.500
With something this useful, 
I could probably do it by myself.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.920
You can make that claim once you've done it.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.420
We're never going to have enough manpower.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.810
Damn it, my arms are killing me!

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.230
Don't you dare take a break! 
It'll get cooler!

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.390
How many more minutes are we doing this?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.860
Roughly... another... twenty to thirty hours.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.860
Ironmaking is insane!

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.570
Don't push yourself, Suika!

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.610
Take a break!

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.620
I still can't make myself useful.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.620
It looks like they're up to 
something really grueling.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.660
I-I... I think I'm going to help—

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.060
No, Ginro.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.620
Don't abandon your post.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.840
Rules are rules.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.490
Come on.

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.910
Just because you already had 
a golden spear made for you...

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.680
I want...

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680
A thing?!

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.390
That's incredibly low, Ginro!

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.340
Swap spears with me, then.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:57.940
No.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.400
I'll settle for gold, even though that's 
kin for gold instead of gin for silver.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.060
No!

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.420
Manpower is our top priority.

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.540
The kingdom of science needs more citizens.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.750
The spear...

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.050
Kinro...

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.770
I knew it.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.920
We almost have Ginro.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.700
Good.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.510
This is working in our favor!

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.940
We're using the bait that is 
science to gain manpower!

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.020
Quit calling it bait, both of you.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.400
But it's not like the whole village 
is going to appreciate a shiny spear.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.830
We need intel about what people want.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:51.030
I'm good at that kind of thing!

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.740
I can turn into a watermelon, so I can 
go anywhere without being noticed!

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.910
Not bad.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.850
All right, Great Detective Suika-sama,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.420
we call on your services to find 
us manpower for ironmaking.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.130
You got this, Great Detective Suika!

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.140
Great Detective Suika...

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.950
I'm going to make myself useful!

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.400
So where did that foreigner go?

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.860
The one Kohaku supposedly brought in.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:33.740
He's living in Chrome's shed!

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.340
The elder believes we should let him be,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.130
so long as he doesn't try 
to come into the village.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.250
I agree with that.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.610
But if he tries to do anything funny...

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.880
I'll kill anyone who's a threat.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.170
Yeah!

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.530
And Ruri will fall for me.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.810
Yeah!

00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.890
The only question is whether 
that man is strong or not, right?

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.520
I don't care if he's strong or not.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.520
What matters is that he's got a good face.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.470
I don't care about a man's 
inner or outer beauty!

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.860
As long as he can hunt and stuff!

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.080
Seriously, though...

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.830
All three of us sisters have different 
tastes, so how are we all still single?!

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.250
Fresh fish is so delicious.

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.620
The flesh is so firm.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.900
I'm so tired of grilled fish.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.850
I went to listen in on people, 
to see if there's anything they want.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.560
First, the dazzling sisters, 
Garnet, Sapphire, and Ruby.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.610
Ah, the prettiest girls in town.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.360
What those three really want...

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.240
I'd appreciate if it's something we can 
make with the technology of this age.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.990
...is a boyfriend!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.740
And that's something we have no 
chance of making with science!

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.490
A strong man.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.640
A handsome man.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.560
Someone who'll feed me.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.710
They're perfectly faithful to their desires.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:11.110
If you ask me, you're quite 
an attractive man, Senku.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.920
But I don't think you're the kind of 
"handsome man" that Sapphire's asking for.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.100
Look at them, saying whatever they want.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:19.810
This is the problem with women.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.910
That's why I hate women.

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.930
You're such a child, Chrome.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.830
Ruri-nee and I are both women, 
so do you hate us?

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.860
Kohaku, I don't think of you as a woman.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.940
You're a gorilla.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:34.780
I'm sorry.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.060
I think I have a shot with the one 
who wants someone to feed her.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.550
What does she want?

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.500
A feast, like fish and stuff.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.450
Speaking of feasts, Ganen, 
the biggest glutton in town,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.800 line:20%
So sick of this...

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.050
said he's bored to death of 
eating grilled fish every day.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.080 line:20%
So sick of this...

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.550
He's been looking for something new to try.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.040 line:20%
So sick of this...

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.460
I knew you could do it, 
Great Detective Suika-sama.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.230
I can already see the scientific bait 
we need to get them on our side.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:08.960
Are you actually going to cook for them?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.770
What does that have to do with science?

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.940
It has everything to do with science.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:15.070
Food <i>is</i> science.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:20.560
Where do you think the umami of the 
fish you eat every day comes from?

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.370
It's glutamic acid and inosinic acid.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.710
Suika, what is that, anyway?

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.090
This is my friend Chalk's favorite toy.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.800
Dogtail millet!

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.510
You mean foxtail millet.

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.350
That might work.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.900
We might be able to make the 
world's most delicious dish

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.360
that everyone in my old world loves.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.200
We're making gourmet 
survival food from scratch.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.960
Now that's exhilarating.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.270
We aren't actually eating 
this foxtail millet, are we?

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.710
I think I'll pass.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.630
We're whacking the hell out of 
it to husk it so we <i>can</i> eat it.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.000
Foxtail millet is genuinely, 
ten billion percent a grain.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.970
It's a primitive millet.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.480
It looks mighty nasty.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.250
It's covered in furry stuff.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.950
It's a cycle of inspiration 
and trial-and-error.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:51.790
Food is a perfect example of science.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:58.300
Now we have wheat flour, 
or rather, foxtail millet flour!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:05.450
Toss in wild bird eggs, and tenderize 
it using potassium carbonate.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.980
It's a dish of science, 
discovered accidentally

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.640
by some nameless Mongol 
sometime around the fourth century.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.270
I guess there was some crazy nut like 
you, Chrome, who would try anything.

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.850
Even in fourth-century Mongolia.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.950
Th-This scent...

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:34.960
We had a name for this stupidly good 
scientific food 3,700 years ago.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.380
We called it "ramen."

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.770
But this is actually foxtail millet, isn't it?

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.490
I'll make sure it's safe!

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.810
It's the duty of a sorcerer not 
to be afraid of anything new!

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:00.360
I-It's good!

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.650
Dude!

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.740
It's so chewy and slippery!

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.450
I've never had anything like it!

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.750
I can't believe such a thing 
would exist in this world!

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.500
I guess I'll dig in, too.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.890
It's been 3,700 years since 
I've had a proper meal.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.700
It wasn't proper at all.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.260
What did I expect from foxtail millet?

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.700
It's so damn crumbly, and it has 
a horrible, bitter aftertaste.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.310
I guess it's edible if you 
think of it as medicine.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.570
Then again, for them, 
I'm sure it's the food of the gods.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.860
This'll work.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.570
Foxtail millet ramen!

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.350
What is going on?!

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.090
Something smells really good!

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.260
People have waged wars over pepper.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.260
Ramen

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:09.260
That's how fundamental 
food is to civilization.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.890
I'm going to colonize this village 
with the scientific food that is ramen.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.430
You look like the villain.

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.000
Next Episode

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.000
Let There Be the Light of Science
