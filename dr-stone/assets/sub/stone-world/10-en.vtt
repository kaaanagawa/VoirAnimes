Biography Series
Edison

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.030
once I started going through 
science books was Edison's.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.580
What even is electricity, anyway?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.290
Huh, there are only four fundamental 
forces in the universe?

Gravity, electromagnetism...

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.490 line:20%
What's five plus three?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.490
So that's what electricity is.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.800
And then there's the strong 
force and the weak force?

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.800
That's hilariously weird.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.100
Basically, electricity is the most 
essential power in this universe.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.750
How exhilarating is that?

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.760
I was born buck-naked and alone 
on this primitive Earth.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.090
A year and four months later, 
I've finally made it.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.370
To the essential power of science...

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.120
To electricity.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.690
This is it.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.690
I'm off to a good start.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.680
All right!

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.830
Man, electricity in the stone age!

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.090
Seriously!

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.990
Right, Tsukasa-chan?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.200
Good morning, world

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.410
Good Morning World!

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.410
Good Morning World!

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.970
How far have I walked?

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.050
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.390
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.010
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.230
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.100
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.120
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.970
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.300
To the ends of the world

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.850
Good morning, world

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.930
Good Morning World!

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.930
Good Morning World!

We'll expand our world

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.020
A Flimsy Alliance

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.410
So you see, Suika, this man called Tsukasa

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.400
is the one behind Senku's murder.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.990
Though I'm not dead.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.530
He's seriously bad news.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.700
He wanted to stop scientific progress,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.870
and he didn't think twice 
about killing Senku to do it.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.710
I told you, I'm not dead.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.110
So that Tsukasa person is a 
bad man, and Gen is with him?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.760
Then Gen's a bad person!

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.330
Wait... But Gen saved us from Magma.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.070
He's a good person!

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.290
He's neither a good 
person nor a bad person.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.890
He's just a thoroughly 
shallow bat of a man.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.150
It doesn't matter whether Asagiri Gen 
is a good guy or a bad guy.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.360
We need him to be on the side 
of the kingdom of science.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.110
We'll have him make a bogus report to 
Tsukasa, saying "Senku is definitely dead."

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.470
That's the only way we can win.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.620
Hear that, Gen?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.830
You saw it, didn't you?

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.950
The electricity?

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.250
The insane light of science?

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.210
Who cares about who wins?

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.220
Who gives a damn about whether 
Tsukasa or Senku has the edge?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.220
The kingdom of science 
is just way more fun!

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.640
Gosh, you're so passionate, young man.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.390
Too bad, though.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.020
I don't have what you do, Chrome-chan.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.390
I'm the most superficial man on earth.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.800
All I care about is whether or 
not something will benefit me.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.130
What is this, a prank?

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.490
Did my manager not stop them?

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.770
I told them I'm a mentalist, 
so I only work as the prankster.

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.400
It's AD 5739.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.440
But you're still nineteen years old.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.010
Huh?

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.950
Aren't you...

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.950
Mentalist Battle!!

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.950
from the TV special about 
psychological magic?

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.120
You were on screen with me, weren't you?

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.790
Oh, right.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.210
You're the "strongest primate high-schooler,"

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.070
Shishio Tsukasa-chan!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.920
I'm gathering here the statues

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.760
of the people who ought to be 
revived first, including you.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.570
The dusty old people of power aren't 
needed in this beautiful stone world.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.470
Let's make a new world together,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.830
Gen.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.580
There's something I'd like you 
to do, as a skilled mentalist.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.060
Follow them.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.200
Figure out their psychology.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.270
I'm just being extra careful,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.140
but if this man, Senku, is still 
alive, I want you to find him.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.970
Senku?

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.390
Senku was the first one to revive.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.110
This is where he created a drug to undo the 
petrification using the power of science.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.550
He's the man who revived me.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.150
And he was attempting to revive all humans,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.230
including the tainted old people,

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.240
and start a civilization that 
would create weapons of science.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.530
The most intelligent man in the world,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.500
whom I killed with these hands.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.240
Who... are you?

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.200
Why...

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.500
What was that noise?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.650
Hey, are you all right, Gen?

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.810
It's no use...

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.430
He obviously died instantly.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.760
This is terrible!

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.390
No, hang on.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.560
He guarded himself with bags of fake blood.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.910
They're all over him!

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.400
This is nuts.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.080
He covered himself with 
these things, just in case!

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.110
Not bad.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:37.120
You're a magician through and through.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.750
He may have blocked it with those 
bags, but he's severely injured.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.090
Damn it.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.040
We have to catch the attacker!

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.790
But who could have done
such a terrible thing?

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.480
I'm going to go investigate!

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.990
Big news!

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.240
I found out who it was!

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.120
Good going, Great Detective Suika.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.500
I know who's behind the 
murder of Asagiri Gen!

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.650
Uh, he's not dead, you know.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.870
So who was it?

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.510
It was...

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:44.220
Now that I've killed the sorcerer, 
I, Magma-sama, am the most powerful!

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.980
Fighting sorcery is no more of a 
challenge than twisting a baby's arm.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.500
Yeah! Indeed!

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.030
It's a shame I couldn't kill Kohaku herself.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.490
She's just too well-prepared.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.300
She's way too strong for a woman.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.160
It <i>must</i> be sorcery.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.100
But now that I've gotten rid 
of her powerful sorcerer ally,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.050
Kohaku is just another girl.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.770
Though, if she apologizes tearfully,

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.430
I wouldn't mind making her 
mine, along with Ruri.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:26.100
How lucky the siblings are to have 
the privilege of belonging to Magma!

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.850
This is really bad news!

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.180
Magma did it? That bastard!

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.530
I see...

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.070
Asagiri Gen made those flowers 
disappear before their eyes.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.570
From Magma's perspective,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.040
Gen is the rumored outsider 
sorcerer that I brought with me.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.770
So Magma stabbed Gen because 
he mistook him for Senku?

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.610
It's a real insult that Magma believes 
my strength is due to sorcery, though.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.620
Well, you have the raw 
power of an actual gorilla.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.180
So you're a legit gorilla.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.180
I'm sorry.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.680
So why is Magma looking for an 
opportunity to kill you, Kohaku?

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.310
Probably... no, <i>definitely</i> because of...

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.400
the Grand Bout.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.930
Once every generation,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:23.100
the village holds a large martial arts
 battle called the Grand Bout.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.160
So that's what that arena-looking 
thing on the far island is for.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.850
Several months ago,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.460
on the day that the village priestess, 
Ruri-nee, came of age...

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.800
The winner of the Grand Bout was to 
wed her and become the village elder.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.150
That's also how my father became 
the current village elder.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.230
The winner is Magma.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.080
On to the finals!

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.330
Damn, Magma's unstoppable.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.520
Yeah!

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.150
Ruri!

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.090
Hey, are you all right, Ruri?

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.070
Hold it.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.270
Don't just approach the priestess so casually.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.090
Ruri, huh?

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.090
Well, she's got a year at most.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.790
I don't want to take care of her.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.690
If she'd just go ahead and croak,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.220
I could take the elder's seat 
without all the trouble.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.500
Maybe I ought to make it

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.280
look like she drowned herself 
out of despair in her sickness.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.910
Mercy!

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.740
The winner of the Grand Bout is Kohaku.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:49.950
Magma, I cannot allow a man 
like you to have Ruri-nee.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.810
Kohaku... This kid...

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:54.870
She joined the Grand Bout just to stop me!

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.610
Wait, what happens now?

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.800
The rules say the winner is 
supposed to marry Ruri-nee, so...

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.890
Ruri-chan and Kohaku-chan 
are going to get married?!

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.110
It's forbidden love!

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.020
Obviously not.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.180 line:20%
Ouchie!

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.270
Jeez, what do we do now?

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.270
Who's going to marry Ruri-sama?

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.940
Is that why your old man, 
the elder, disowned you?

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.990
No... well, that was the last straw, but...

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.580
Kohaku has caused a ton of 
trouble ever since she was little.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.850
Of course, the Grand Bout 
is set to be redone.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.950
It's going to be held next month.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.590
Are you saying Magma killed 
Gen to win the Grand Bout?

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.540
So Gen really <i>is</i> dead?!

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.840
No, he's not dead.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.810
Wouldn't it be really bad news if 
a guy like him became the elder?

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.850
Yeah.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.790
If Magma were to become the elder,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.100
it might be hard to even 
get the medicine to Ruri.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.900
It's also an opportunity.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.340
If a man from the kingdom of science 
defeats Magma and wins the Grand Bout,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.780
marries Ruri-nee, and becomes 
the elder, it'll solve everything.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
Rounding up citizens for 
the kingdom of science

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.440
and giving Ruri-nee the cure-all 
medicine would be easy.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.570
Kinro, Ginro,

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.290
there's something I want to ask you.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.600
How do you view Ruri-nee?

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.510
Would you like to take her as your wife?

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.610
I-I've never even thought about it.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:32.890
But Ruri-chan—

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:39.060
Ruri-sama is pretty, and I mean... 
her face is almost the same as yours, but...

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.660
But she's busty— I mean, 
she's really graceful and cute,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.090
and she has big, round eyes...

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:45.190
All you've talked about is about her face.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.580
Do you only ever look at a girl's appearance?

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.000
You're utterly shallow, Ginro.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.200
C-Come on, I said she's bus— 
she's bu— she's graceful!

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.800
My answer is simple.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.660
The gatekeeper doesn't ask questions.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.960
Rules are rules.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:06.460
But listening to one murmur to 
themselves is not against the rules.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.590
I already understand that Senku isn't evil.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.890
You can skip the explanation, as usual.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:17.970
What's your objective?

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:28.030
I want to save my sister's life.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.040
All right.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.710
You don't need to explain further.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.850
Too shallow!

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.040
Do you really think you can 
defeat Magma like that?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.090
Let's take a break!

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:48.860
No!

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.510
Finish three more sets first!

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:51.970
Hold it!

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.180
Chrome.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.440
I'd really prefer to train 
you more than anyone.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:09.030
But Kinro and Ginro are the only ones 
who have a chance of defeating Magma.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.920
I'm sorry.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.020
Yo, Chrome, she's being all 
"sorry, sorry!" about our plan

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.570
to get Kinro or Ginro to marry Ruri

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.910
because you're in love with her.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.330
You're as brutal as ever.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.460
This place is amazing!

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.240
Hey, Ruri!

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.800
I'm okay.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.560
Is it the usual thing again?

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.310
Chrome, they told me I'm 
not going to get better.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.030
I'm not going to live to become an adult.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.790
I'll take care of it, Ruri.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.360
I'll look for whatever I can.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.760
I promise I'll cure you someday!

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.360
Yeah.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:02.120
I'm totally cool with that.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.270
I can ask for nothing more than the cure-all

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.130
science drug to save Ruri 
so she can live a good life.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.720
I'm the genius sciencer, after all.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:20.760
Job-changing from a sorcerer 
to a sciencer, huh?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.480
Yeah. I'm not calling myself 
a sorcerer anymore.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.580
Let's let the battle team 
deal with the Grand Bout

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.220
while we, the science team, 
focus on making the sulfa drug.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.430
Heck yeah!

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.160
I plan on participating in the Grand Bout.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.820
The kingdom of science team, 
with Kinro, Ginro and me,

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.310
will do whatever it takes 
to stop Magma's victory.

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.290
Yeah.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.740
Hey, Gen, are you all right?

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.370
His recovery is going to take 
a long time at this rate.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.630
Which means...

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.640
Yeah.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.640
We have a short time limit before 
Tsukasa comes to kill me.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.010
I'm still sleepy!

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.080
Wake up, Ginro.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.430
You <i>just</i> agreed to do morning training 
until we rotate on our guard duty.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.350
Oh, no!

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.650
Gen's vanished!

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.990
Yeah, I'm sure he went back to Tsukasa.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.750
But why would he sneak out like that?

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:09.040
That bat bastard better not intend 
to tell Tsukasa that Senku's alive.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.550
This is bad, Senku.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.960
We have to go after him.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.190
Wait, Tsukasa-chan! It's me!

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.920
Tsukasa-chan!

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.280
I found a primitive village.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.200
I got in a fight with them and 
ended up just slightly injured.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.030
And Senku-chan was...

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.460
We have to catch the bat bastard, quick.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.920
Hold it!

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.060
Why are you stopping me, Senku?

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.810
We have to catch the bat bastard!

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.180
We can leave him be.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:16.660
If Gen really didn't have a 
millimeter of interest in science,

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.570
he never would have cooperated to begin with.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:26.450
He'd already made up his mind on whose 
side he was on when I made electricity.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:34.040
But as a superficial man, he has 
his superficial ways of saving face.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.770
Men are such a pain in the ass,

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.800
in any era.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:44.800
This is making me thirsty for a drink.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.800
Like, say, cola.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:53.390
Can you make it in this 
stone world, Senku-chan?

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.900
Can you make a bottle of cola?

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.850
Yeah, I can.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.650
Even if no one else can.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:18.580
Senku-chan... was gone without a trace.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.880
He's dead, without a doubt.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.340
So Gen's joining the kingdom of science?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.460
Yeah.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.220
I'm sure he'll wander back 
like nothing happened.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.410
Looks like the first battle between the 
Tsukasa Empire and the kingdom of science,

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.930
the fight for Asagiri Gen, ends in 
victory for the kingdom of science.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.420
Gen is a good person after all!

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.770
Yeah!

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:49.230
It's the world's flimsiest alliance, 
bound by a single bottle of cola.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.380
Man, this really isn't worth it.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.080
All for a single bottle of cola...

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.840
I hope it's super well-cooled, at least.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.260
All right, damn it.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.950
I'll have to apply science to 
make Gen a ridiculously chilled

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.990
bottle of cola in time for when he gets back.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.510
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.000
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.820
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.750
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.190
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.700
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.830
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.710
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.430
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.900
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.520
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.850
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.910
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:20.480
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.850
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:25.980
Tell me why?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.070
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.780
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:35.330
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:41.120
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.880
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.960
Next Episode

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.960
