00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.170
You can see so far away!

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.070
The sun's gonna rise soon!

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.850
Don't look at the sun through the telescope.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.780
If the stones you guys got 
are the right ones...

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.140
Wow, it's like a mountain of jewels.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.650
It's not <i>like</i> a mountain of jewels. 
It <i>is</i> a mountain of jewels.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.430
It's a treasure trove of super rare metals.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.280
Jewels, my ass.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.830
They're just slightly heavy rocks.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.900
After all that fuss...

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.180
We're going to win against 
Tsukasa-chan's army with these rocks.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.260
With these rocks?

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.820
I see.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.300
With these gems!

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.950
I can see them being heavy 
enough to really hurt.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.050
Father, I don't think that's what...

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.470
You can't blame him.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.910
Father is of an older generation.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.120
What?!

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.850
We're up against Tsukasa-chan's army. 
They're going to be seriously tough.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.060
Our plan is to make cell phones using 
these rocks and win the information war.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.150
But, Senku, how much longer is it going 
to take to make our cell phones?

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.350
She's right.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.460
Once spring comes, Tsukasa-kun's 
army is going to be rushing in.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.370
The goal's not that far away.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.820
To put it simply...

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.530
The vacuum tube is the 
heart of the cell phone.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.280
Ramen

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280
Ramen

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.220
Plastics make up its skeleton.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.900
Ramen

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.940
Ramen

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.990
Ramen

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.030
Ramen

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.070
Ramen

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.110
Ramen

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.070
Ramen

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.810
The microphone is the vocal cord.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.820
Ramen

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.820
The gold wire is the veins.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.870
With these four body parts, 
we can finish the cell phone.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.770
This mega-huge science project 
is coming to a close.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.050

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.050
Cell Phone

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.250
Everyone, we're sprinting all 
the way to the goal from here!

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.020
Wave of Science

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.970
First, we're going to make the filaments,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.980
which are essential for the vacuum tubes...

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.300
using tungsten, the most heat-resistant 
metal in the universe,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120
Heat Resistance Power Rankings

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120
Lead

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.120
Glass

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.120
sleeping inside this blue light.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.480
But, Senku, how are we going 
to get it out of the stone?

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.790
About that... It's going to be tough as hell.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.650
What the hell are you two doing?!

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.950
We're getting it out of the rocks, aren't we?

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.260
All we need to do is destroy it.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.250
I mean, that works.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.250
We'll be turning it into powder, anyway.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.010
See? I was right!

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.120
No one asked you!

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.930
What if you'd been wrong?!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.190
This is unusual.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.440
He's hardly doing it right, 
but I've never seen him offer to help.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.780
Did something happen in the cave?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.700
You get to see all the insane stuff 
that humanity worked together

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.410
for two million years to build.
Stuff you never would've seen otherwise.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.620
And I'll show you so much of it, 
it'll make your head spin.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.580
Senku!

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.850
I don't care if you're the boss anymore.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.710
At least, until we deal with that Tsukasa guy.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.290
Gee, I don't know.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.290
We're done.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.660
What's next?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.860
I'm going to do chemistry stuff 
to this powdered blue rock

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.870
to turn it into something 
resembling toothpaste.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.560
Right, you're doing chemistry stuff.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.020
The stuff it wouldn't do me 
any good to ask about.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.400
Lastly, we're going to get rid of the rust 
on the toothpaste stuff using hydrogen,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.070
warm it up in a glass container, and it's done.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.650
It needs to be at least 1,000 degrees.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.500
The hotter it is, 
the stronger the tungsten will be.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.190
So all we have to do is cook it.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.420
Hey, it's actually pretty easy.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.450
What are you, stupid?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.490
What would happen to a glass container

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.180
if you threw it into a fire 
that's 1,000 degrees?

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.390
Tungsten

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.390
Glass

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.390
We have to heat up <i>just</i> the tungsten 
toothpaste inside the glass container.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.730
Then we need a heating mechanism 
with pinpoint accuracy.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.650
How do we do it?

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.330
We don't have time. Let's split up the work.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.740
I'll deal with the 
toothpaste-making chemistry stuff.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.480
So who's making the 
pinpoint heating mechanism?

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.300
Are there any other science users?

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.680
Chrome, you know everything you 
need to make one from scratch.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.340
Throw all the science tricks 
you've learned at it.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.050
Or do you need Senku-sensei's help?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.850
Don't make me laugh.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.860
I'm Chrome!

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.370
I'm a smart-as-hell science user!

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.650
Don't come crying to me for help at your lab.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.130
Yeah, I got the lab stuff.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.200
I'm leaving you in charge of the heating team.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.830
You make me jealous.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:43.500
You know, I've always loved 
making things, even as a kid.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.930
I made all sorts of things—bridges, shields—

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.800
so that people wouldn't look at me funny.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.560
Thanks to that, I get to pretend I'm 
still in the game, even at this age.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.400
But to be honest, I can't help but 
wish I had a maker buddy, too.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.030
But you have two friends, Old Man Kaseki.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.570
Maker buddies.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.650
Two?

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.580
Where?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.370
Right here.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.800
Me?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.590
Even though I'm almost 
fifty years older than you?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.980
Our age?

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.220
That matters somehow?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.700
What the hell?!

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.130
He's even more gung-ho than usual.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.380
Come help me over here, modern man.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.250
You must know at least a little 
more chemistry than the villagers.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.300
I'm not sure.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.910
There's a ridiculous number of steps.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.810
I bet you won't get a millimeter 
of this, so I'll make it simple.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.020
Cook the blue gem powder 
in sodium hydroxide;

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.810
use sea shells, hydrochloric acid,
and ammonia to crystallize it;

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.150
and then bake it and mix it with honey.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.340
Okay! I understood all of that, Senku-chan.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.150
Honey! Bake it, and then honey.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.910
I got that much.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.350
Chrome's definitely ten billion 
times more useful than you.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.030
Nah, I don't think <i>anyone</i>
could have kept up with that.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.920
You're the only one who gets it, Senku-chan.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.550
Nothing beats this when it 
comes to pinpoint heating!

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.450
There it is! Chrome's special move!

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.510
Quit showing it off.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.830
You're reminding me of bad times.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.530
I don't know how much 
heat it produces, though.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.900
Let's set up some metals 
in order of heat resistance

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.150
so we can measure the temperature.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.830
It's not even doing anything to the lead,
and that's the weakest one.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.860
It's winter, after all.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.130
If we just had a little more sunlight...

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.090
Throw all the science tricks 
you've learned at it.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.720
We're using fire, too.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.600
Add the cotton candy machine 
to the pinpoint heating!

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:50.540
Blorp...

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:50.540
Lead

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.390
Damn! We need more than just me and Suika.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.930
We defeated the lead, though.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:57.030
Blurrp

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:57.030
Gold

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:57.030
Silver

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.010
Wow, we beat gold and silver!

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.030
Good going, battle team!

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.580
Blurrgh

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.580
Iron

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.570
We made it to iron!

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.580
Go, gorilla team!

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.660
We made it past 1,000 degrees!

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.900
It needs to be at least 1,000 degrees.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.880
The hotter it is, the stronger 
the tungsten will be.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.800
No, we need more.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.050
Add electricity power!

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.610
All right, it's done!

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.810
Tungsten toothpaste!

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.630
How are things on your side, heating team?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.910
We're just about done.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:35.270
Not bad, science user.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.240
What the hell is this 
all-of-the-above mega set?!

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.780
Senku, you were the one who 
said to throw everything at it.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.410
This isn't what I meant.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.540
This thing's ugly as hell.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.300
Honestly, though, this might 
actually be the best solution.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.180
If the goal is for all of us to join 
together to raise the temperature...

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.600
We're going to make a long, 
thin blob of tungsten toothpaste.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.450
Zap water with electricity, 
and it'll produce hydrogen.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.980
That hydrogen, with a lot of heat, 
peels the rust right off the toothpaste.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.010
Here we go. Pinpoint heating...

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.940
...to several thousand degrees!

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.630
We have the most heat-resistant 
metal in the universe...

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.460
A tungsten filament!

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.260
Now, we have everything we need.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.940
Ramen

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.940
We're on our final sprint 
to making cell phones!

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.260
Let's get it done one step at a time.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.400
Time to build the cell phone's 
heart, the vacuum tube.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.370
There's some slightly complicated 
glasswork we need done to finish that.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.050
I don't know if even you can 
handle it, Old Man Kaseki.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.610
Oh, please.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.330
I made this ridiculously challenging, 
twisty thing before.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.960
It'll take more than that to scare me.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.460
Here, show me the blueprint.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:34.600
"Hickman Pump"

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.070
It's called a Hickman pump.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.030
Its vacuum action is off the charts!

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.350
A level ten billion vacuum pump!

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:34.600
You sound like a vacuum cleaner commercial.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.860
Vacuum tubes are made by 
removing as much air as possible.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.090
The prototype we built before was a 
simple level-one pump for light bulbs.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.780
It won't give us enough power.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:45.390
Air

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:46.430
Air

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.150
Where do I even begin?

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.540
Is this even humanly possible?

00:12:53.870 --> 00:13:00.190
In our age, only the super talented 
craftsmen built Hickman pumps.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:05.230
Then again, it was a different age, 
so don't feel too bad, Kaseki-chan.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.840
It'll never work.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.160
Is that true?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.150
Yeah.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.540
It's true, but why would 
a mentalist know that?

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.560
He's just talking out of his 
ass to get Kaseki fired up.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.080
I'm fine.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.850
I don't need your mental care.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:29.560
It's the complicated stuff that 
gets me fired up, anyway.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.740
In exchange, though...

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.830
I want to do that thing you 
did with Chrome the other day.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.520
Y'know...

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.840
as maker buddies.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.510
All right!

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.510
You can handle the vacuum tube, Kaseki.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.020
Gotcha!

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.030
Hey, hey, Senku...

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.410
I just noticed something.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.410
Old Man Kaseki's acting like a kid and all,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:12.830
but he's actually trying to 
lighten your burden a little.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.580 line:20%
I know that. What are you, stupid?

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.830
S-Senku...

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.840
Is there anything we kids can do?

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:25.210
Yeah.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.510
Suika, you guys can handle the wire.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.740
Yay!

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.350
We're members of the kingdom of science, too.

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:40.600
We kids are going to make the 
wire without relying on Senku!

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.950
Yeah!

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:49.110
Now the chemistry team 
can focus on making plastic.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.400
Yeah!

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.260
Although I have no idea what 
this whatever-tic stuff is.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:57.800
Actually, that's the step on the road map 
that I was the most worried about.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.250
Copper

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.250
Coal

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.250
Charcoal

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.250
Beehive

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.250
Plastic

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.250
Can we even make plastic in this world?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.340
Isn't it made from, like, 
petroleum or something?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.900
Come, Gen, you're with us.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.140
I'm going to work you to death in 
return for getting me hyped up.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.800
So mean!

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:20.380
Old Man Kaseki's kind of got 
a soft spot for Gen, huh?

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.860
Let's hurry up and start making some plastic.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.820
First, we simmer some wood and 
boil the liquid that comes out.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.660
Pour it over some hot copper, and—

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.410
Wait, wait, wait!

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.590
I'm completely lost.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.700
You heat it to get some liquid, 
heat that again, and heat that again?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.460
What are we even doing?

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.730
We're modding the heck out of it, 
adding and removing ingredients.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.210
Chemistry is all about 
addition and subtraction.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.720
We did some addition and subtraction, 
and now we have formalin.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.810
It's the stuff you use to preserve corpses.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.940
The smell!

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.600
Here we go again with the sketchy chemicals 
having to do with corpses and stuff!

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.820
Good.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.350
Now we just need a ton of coal ash.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.730
Coal ash plus sodium hydroxide 
plus formaline makes

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.780
humanity's first synthetic plastic, bakelite.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.360
R-Right.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.850
So we just need to burn a 
crazy amount of coal, right?

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.310
My hands are numb from cold.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:23.670
We aren't getting much work done.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.830
What a harsh winter this is.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:30.300
I hope no one dies from the cold this year.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.030
Coal?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.870
Yeah.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.030
We need a stupid amount of it.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.180
This is just the job for you guys.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.570
Hey, Ginro.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.850
Where to?

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.350
Oh, you know, I have to train, too.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.910
And I already work as a guard 
protecting the village,

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.280
so I think I'll pass.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.170
What are you talking about?

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.590
The village elder Senku's word is law.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.500
This is totally going to 
be one of those hard jobs!

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.820
Rules are rules.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.140
It's so warm in this house.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.710
Let's make a warm meal 
for everyone to eat.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.770
We can get our work done a lot faster now.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.090
We're only after the ashes from the coals.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.780
If you want to sit by the 
fire, suit yourselves.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.750
This is impressive.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.210
What you're making is totally unrelated,

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.300
and yet the village becomes 
more and more enriched.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.510
Yeah.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.970
That's the way science is.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:22.280
Senku, my decision to grant you 
the throne wasn't in error.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:26.940
Huh? Zinc-carbon batteries?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.170
Are we using batteries to 
finish the vacuum tubes?

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.390
The build instructions 
and materials are there.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.570
We'll use the manganese 
we got in the caves.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.860
So you want me to make them, right?

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.770
Zinc for seaweed.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.770
Manganese rice balls.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.520
Coal in the middle.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.280
Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.030
Look at that, a zinc-carbon battery.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.060
Huh?

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.650
It's already done.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.280
It wasn't that brutal!

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.040
Manganese rice balls.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.790
Tons of manganese.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.660
Manganese rice balls.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.420
Lots of manganese.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.790
Manganese rice balls.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.040
Tons of manganese.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.750
We need 800 of those.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.130
What?! Eight hundred?!

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.250
This is brutal.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.680
I'll help, of course.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.450
Here's the wine you asked for.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.270
Are you holding a banquet or something?

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.020
No, we're making microphones, 
the cell phone's vocal cord.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.900
With wine?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.170
Yeah.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:42.570
Actually, we're using the pink 
grains stuck on the lid here.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.280
Then we mix some cooked seaweed in hot water.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.470
That's it.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:51.100
Which part of this is the "microphone" thing?

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.290
Also, what are these shiny rocks?

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:56.750
They're called Rochelle salts.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.630
They turn sound into electricity.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.830
Tack this onto something light,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.150
like a plastic megaphone, 
and you get a microphone.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.290
We've cleared plastic!

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.710
We've cleared wire!

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.670
We've cleared vacuum tubes!

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.760
We've cleared microphones!

delivering voices over infinite distances...

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.760
It's the birth of the cell phone!

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.190
Yeah, baby!

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.320
Cell phone acquired!!

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.960
Yay!

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.160
Oh, man!

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.920
We managed to finish it before spring.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:15.250
The final battle against Tsukasa is at hand.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.950
This is exhilarating.

This is a work of fiction, but the plants,
animals, and production methods described are based on reality.
Foraging and making things on your own accord is extremely dangerous
and, in some cases, illegal. Please do not imitate without expertise.
