WEBVTT

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.710
This small chunk won't be enough, 
but it came down the stream in the cave.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.150
There must be tons further inside.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.490
Tons of this heat-resistant 
treasure called tungsten!

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.360
We only have one set of 
materials left to make a light.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.040
The last member of the 
exploration team will be...

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.690
Magma.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.910
Tungsten's tough as hell. We're going 
to need brute force to collect it.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.510
Let's go cave diving. 
We're a trio of spelunking buddies.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.730
To the fun treasure dungeon!

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.650
Senku, Chrome, and Magma?!

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.980
I've never heard of such a risky group.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.890
I-I-Is that even safe?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.740
He might be like, "I'm the chief!" 
and attack you or something, Senku!

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.250
Come on, let's get going,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.540
the three of us.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.040
Vacuum Tube

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.040
We're after the magic stone that we'll 
need for making vacuum tube filaments:

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.050
scheelite, which glows blue 
under ultraviolet light.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.800
The most heat-resistant metal 
in the world, tungsten!

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.800
This chunk came down a 
stream in the cave, too.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.810
There must be a treasure trove further in.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.690
I'm counting on you to take 
us to the cave, Chrome.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.700
Got it!

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.210
Going into the caves with 
two science users...

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.820
No one will be watching.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.120
He's finally gone.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.350
Senku-chan's gone from Ishigami Village.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.030
The water's lukewarm.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.160
We can definitely expect some treasures.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.300
Yo, Senku...

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.970
Was it honestly a good idea 
to bring Magma along?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.290
He's a meathead who doesn't care about 
anything but being king of the hill.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.380
He's totally intent on snuffing you out

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.900
when you least expect it 
and taking over the village.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.900
Think about what's going on.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.610
We desperately need tungsten 
in order to make cell phones.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.820
That treasure is in the depths of the cave,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.410
and to dig it out, we need 
Magma's power desperately.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.100
The situation is ten billion percent simple.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:41.300
We have to do it, so there's no point in 
thinking about the buts, what-ifs, or risks.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.260
Still, though...

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.920
If Magma were to shove us down 
and say we died in an accident,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.600
it'd be the perfect crime.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.870
Besides, if he takes our heads 
to Tsukasa, and science vanishes,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.000
Tsukasa won't attack.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.320
No way the meathead's thought that far ahead.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.160
Get back!

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.620
What's up, Senku?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.830
It's mica.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.210
It's like Baumkuchen... 
which doesn't help, I guess.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.770
Even though it's a rock, it's brittle 
enough to break with your fingers.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.050
Look.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.780
They're natural pit traps.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.670
Damn, nature's traps are nasty.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.930
Would you be stuck if you fell into one?

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.350
Yeah.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.800
Try to get back up with a rope or ladder,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.270
and it'll cave in on you and bury you alive.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.300
No! Let go, Senku!

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.250
It's going to cave in under your feet!

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.920
Didn't you see that?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.410
Magma tried to shove us into the mica pits!

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.060
Yeah, that's right!

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.410
I came to this cave to kill you two!

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.070
You little twigs act so big, but you're 
so useless, you can hardly even hunt!

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.030
The strongest becomes the 
boss and gets the women,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.030
and the village becomes stronger.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.990
That's mother nature.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.330
That's life.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.470
"Science," my ass!

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:46.840
Senku, maybe in your world, 
the twigs controlled the muscles,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.020
but this is the world of stone!

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.900
You're the one getting in our way!

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:59.950
Damn it, Senku, if only you hadn't 
come to Ishigami Village that day,

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.860
I would have been in power.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.940
I'm the one who's truly strong.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.410
I'm the number one man!

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.540
Senku! Magma!

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.810
Quit wandering around!

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.440
You're getting on my nerves!

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.770
I'm measuring stuff.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.770
There's no way we're 
getting out of this hole.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.890
It's ten billion times better than just 
sitting and waiting like some idiot.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.950
Keep raising your voice like a dumbass, 
and it'll cave in and bury us alive.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.050
You damn twig...

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.170
Are you messing with me?!

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.730
I'll kill you, you little twig!

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.590
I told you, it'll cave in if you keep shouting.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.640
If we keep pouring in water 
from that pond over there,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.810
you might be able to swim back out.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.230
It's never going to work 
if you pour it that slowly!

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.470
Slow and steady wins the race, right?

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.280
It's better than doing nothing!

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.620
Hang on.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.190
That's not bad.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.810
We have no use for resignation 
or for arguing about diligence.

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.620
Science determines whether it'll work or not.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.000
Connecting the gas mask tubes will give us 
a good meter of drop height from the surface.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.890
If the inner diameter of the tube is 
two centimeters, by Torricelli's law,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.710
the flow will be 0.00139 
cubic meters per second.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:58.360
If the hole is 28 cubic meters, 
that's 20131.68 seconds, or 5.59 hours.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:09:01.390
Q: Flow
    Q=AV (A: tube cross-section area, V: fluid speed)
    V=√2gh (Torricelli's law)
                 (g: gravitational acceleration, h: height of fluid surface)
Q=(0.01)²xπx√2x9.8x1
=0.001390842357211[m3/sec]
Volume of hole
    V=2x2x7 (Base is 2 square meters, depth is 7 meters)
    =28[m³]
Therefore, the time to fill the hole with water is...

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.390
Since it's lukewarm, we should 
just barely avoid hypothermia.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.540
Chrome, I'm going to tell 
you how to craft something.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.770
Can you do it?

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.550
Yeah, of course I can.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:17.320
Don't underestimate Chrome the science user!

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.140
See? I told you.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.750
We're screwed if any one of us is missing.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.930
The twigs controlled 
the muscles in my world?

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.770
Obviously not.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.890
We were just divvying up the work.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.270
In a technological civilization, 
you need twigs like us,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.640
and we need brawny meatheads like you.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.780
Even someone who's got nothing going 
for them can come in useful someday.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.150
It doesn't matter who's 
the boss or who's on top.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.140
There are all kinds of people.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.160
And that equals strength.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.650
I don't care about your babble.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.080
Senku, you took the throne from me.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.920
That's all.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.450
Yeah, you're right.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.750
But in exchange...

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.780
You get to see all the insane stuff 
that humanity worked together

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.730
for two million years to build.
Stuff you never would've seen otherwise.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.980
And I'll show you so much of it, 
it'll make your head spin.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.830
How is the water going from low to high?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.360
Time for happy grade school 
science: the siphon!

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.380
I'll explain, just in case.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.910
Fill a tube with water, then take it to 
a point lower than the water surface.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.910
The water will flow upward 
and continue flowing.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.770
It'll even work in your bathtub. Give it a try.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.330
This is bad.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.990
It's going to take a while longer 
for the water to fill up,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.370
but Senku's almost out of energy.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.500
You go ahead and get up, little twig.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.890
I'm the number one power of the 
Ishigami Village, living by the sea.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.260
Don't underestimate me.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.920
Senku!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.180
I don't care if you're the boss anymore.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.180
At least, until we deal with that Tsukasa guy.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.720
But if you show me anything 
lame, I'll kill you!

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.700
Yeah, that works for me.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.140
There's no way science could be lame.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:21.760
Magma's brute strength got us 
out of the worst-case scenario.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.910
Worst-case scenario?

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.760
The fact that we'd have been dead 
had our bodies gotten any colder.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.350
This is why I can't stand you little twigs.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.140
No.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.410
The worst-case scenario that would 
have occurred if we'd gotten any colder...

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.900
is...

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.220
Magma and I would've had to hold
each other to maintain our body heat.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.030
That definitely is the worst-case scenario.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.900
I was right!

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.930
I found it.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.950
This striped rock face...

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.040
This dungeon we're currently in...

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.280
It's a skarn deposit.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.550
We can get a stupid amount 
of sweet minerals here.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.710
It's nature's treasure chest.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.410
This is crazy!

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.110
White, black, blue, gold...

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.220
It really is clearly separated into stripes!

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.140
I've never seen a rock like this!

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.810
A rock is a rock, isn't it?

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.950
The magma underground boils water 
that gets into the white rocks,

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:03.690
the limestone, that's all over the place.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.020
All the stuff that's inside the 
hot water seeps into the rocks,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.370
transforming it into all 
different kinds of rocks.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.580
That's a skarn deposit, nature's treasure chest.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.150
I see.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.710
That's why the parts around the 
cracks transform and form stripes.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.950
In other words, with 
Magma's strength on our side,

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.340
we're able to acquire super-rare gems.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.290
All right, we're here.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.270
The gems we're after are inside this wall.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:38.990
The rocks are hard as hell.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.770
We twigs are useless for digging them out.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.650
We're counting on you, number-one power.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.650
I didn't want to attack you head-on 
and get countered by science weapons.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.720
But you wouldn't be alarmed if I were to raise

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.100
a weapon while I'm digging 
for treasures, would you?

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.040
You wouldn't—

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.790
That's right!

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:07.710
The backs of your heads 
are wide open right now!

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.220
And I was going to murder you.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.810
I'm sure you were.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.480
That's why you couldn't help but 
save us back at the mica hole.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.290
I know you weren't trying 
to shove me into the hole.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.980
You were trying to save me.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.810
Magma.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.210
Sorry.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.730
I insulted you.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.870
Hit me.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.580
I don't care anymore.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.930
It doesn't change the fact 
that I was going to kill you!

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.690
The most heat-resistant rock in the universe!

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.900
It's ours!

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.190
Tungsten acquired!!

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.510
Yeah.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.370
Tungsten's an insane treasure...

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.340
but in this dungeon of treasures, 
the three of us found

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:25.080
an even more precious treasure: 
the treasure of friendship.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.940
What are you even talking about?

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.090
That's so cringy.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.780
Yeah, totally cringy.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.470
Sh-Shut up!

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.610
I regretted it the moment 
it came out of my mouth!

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.100
Why are you two suddenly hitting it off?!

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.160
Oh, man, there's way too much treasure here!

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.170
Look! Manganese!

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.440
Manganese that's used 
for manganese batteries!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.720
Copper pyrite!

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.080
Sphalerite!

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.940
They're just rocks!

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.240
Are you done yet?!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.970
The sun's going to set!

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.500
Bring Senku-chan back by 
evening three days from now.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.000
If you do...

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.570
We're heading back!

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.140
Oh, come on, just a little longer.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.420
Yeah, we found a mountain of treasure.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.300
You little twigs aren't going 
to carry all that anyway!

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.110
Hurry up!

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.700
Why are you suddenly in such a hurry?

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.940
What the hell are you doing?!

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.030 line:20%
Where are you taking Senku?! Hey!

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.880
Hey, Senku-chan.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.000
Welcome back.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.750
Huh? What's going on?

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.810
Don't bother trying to call for help, Senku.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.260
We're all working with Gen.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.510
So you bastards finally 
figured out the hack, huh?

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.530
All you need to do is hand science 
and my head over to Tsukasa,

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.660
and the village is safe. It's perfectly logical.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.820
I have no idea what you're 
talking about, but...

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.130
An astronomy telescope...

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.630
Or rather, an observatory...

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.010
I'm going to space.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.900
January Fourth...

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.950
Rock Day!

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.130
I heard it's your birthday today, Senku.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.800
We all got you a birthday gift.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.940
He's finally gone.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.570
Hey, guys, hear me out.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.070
I have an awesome idea.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:49.110
I mean, I just vaguely remembered that
you can put two lenses in a tube.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.490
It's half-assed, but whatever.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.000
Hey

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.250
These people would like to help.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:07.710
Senku better get me something
 even more awesome for my birthday.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.610
This is way too much work, man.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.320
Yeah.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.850
The whole village worked hard to make this.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.280
You're going to have to fine-tune 
it yourself, Senku-chan.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.280
Yeah.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:27.530
Hang on, Senku! Are you moved 
for the first time in forever?

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:29.370
You can cry, you know.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.420
You don't need to hold it in.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.120
You're so low, Ginro.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.120 line:20%
Go on! Go on! Go on!

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.660
Good job, everyone!

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.700
This is extremely practical.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.890
We can use it on our 
watchtower against Tsukasa.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.260
Y-Yeah, that's true.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.890
Your feedback's as rational as ever.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.520
A guy doesn't bother 
bringing up his own birthday.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.980
How did you know it was today?

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:03.330
Our internal clocks are messed up 
from the petrification, though.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.970
I don't even know how old I am anymore.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.340
Think about how many days you've been alive.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.950
What about you?

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.750
6,268 days.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.210
Oh... So you used a leading question on me.

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.210
Still, you couldn't have figured it out 
if you didn't know when I revived.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.630
Don't you remember?

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.540
You wrote the day your 
petrification was undone...

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:35.020
AD 5738
April 1

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.390
by the miracle cave,

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.020
as soon as you woke up.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.690
So he wrote this when he was un-petrified?

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.900
How did he know what day it was?

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.540
Was he... The whole time?

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.750
This dude's totally insane.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.980
Come to think of it, 
ever since the beginning...

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.910
Since before I met you...

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:04.030
I've been rather fond of you, Senku-chan, 
setting aside personal gains.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.010
I'm sure it's the same 
for the other villagers.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.150
You might say that's cringy, though.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.610
Yeah, that's cringy.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.180
See?
