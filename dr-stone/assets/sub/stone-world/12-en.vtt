00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.780
So this thin hair-like stuff 
is going to turn into silver?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.320
Damn... I thought they were 
roots from some plant.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.010
That's going to become my silver spear, huh?

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.420
Man, science sure is strange, isn't it?

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.910
Speaking of which...

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.070
Kinro, you already got your golden spear, ri—

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.300
Oh, wait...

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.760
Sorry! I didn't notice.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.490
Who would have thought we'd only get 
a silver spear, and not a gold one?

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.770
Ginro, move your arms, not your mouth!

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.890
Hang on, though.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.980
Why are you only making a silver spear?

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.190
Because we need it to get the 
maximum danger materials.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.900
Yes!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.580
I finally have a silver spear!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.990
Yay! Thanks, Senku!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.990 line:20%
Yippee! Yippee!

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.630
You don't owe me one millimeter of thanks.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.500
I didn't make that for <i>you</i>.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380
Come on, let's get moving.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.260
Bodyguard Ginro

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.900
Ginro, your job is to be the team's bodyguard.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.730
Bodyguard! Bodyguard!

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.890
I'm a bodyguard!

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.600
I'm Ginro!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.380 line:20%
I'm Ginro!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.030
Hey, this is the hot spring area that 
I draw hot water from all the time.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.870
I came all prepared because you said 
it was going to be "maximum danger."

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.090
It gets dangerous up ahead.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.150
Ginro, quit messing around 
and hold your spear forward.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.240
Huh?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.740
This silver spear is a sensor.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.590
That's what I made it for.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710
Take a good look at the tip.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.150
If that silver spear turns black...

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.970
If it turns black...?

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.390
A few seconds later, you'll be dead.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.150
You need to get away within 0.1 seconds.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.350
We'll all run, too.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.110
The enemy we're about to 
go up against will send us

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.320
to the afterlife with just one mistake.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.570
This is the greatest hurdle 
in making sulfa drugs.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.160
Good morning, world

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.370
Good Morning World!

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.370
Good Morning World!

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.930
How far have I walked?

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.010
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.350
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.980
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.190
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.070
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.080
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.250
To the ends of the world

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.800
Good morning, world

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.890
Good Morning World!

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.890
Good Morning World!

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.970
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.310
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.740
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.660
We'll expand our world

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.040
Buddies Back to Back

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.300
There isn't a single fish in this river.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.460
I know.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.500
Nothing but emerald green liverwort.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.790
This is it for sure.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.800
Our goal is upstream from here.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.270
So the greatest hurdle is up ahead...

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.730
It's okay.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.040
It's okay.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.940
It's okay. It's not black yet.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.480
It's okay.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.930
It's okay.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.460
It's okay.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.240
It's ok—

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.100
What the hell is the sensor doing 
walking at the back, Ginro?!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.920
Well, you said I was gonna die!

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.370
I'm scared!

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.090
Want to switch places with me, then?

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.890
Hand over the silver spear.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.990
Never!

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.940
I'll do it!

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.410
I'll do it, all right?!

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.380
It's okay.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.860
It's okay...

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.710
I-I-I-It's okay...

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.470
It's okay...

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.160
It's okay...

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.250
It's—

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.420
Chrome, Senku, Kohaku-chan...

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.940
We're here, Senku.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.450
I knew it.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.200
We've found the source of the materials 
that were our greatest hurdle.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.160
I don't even know what we're here to gather,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.210
but I can at least appreciate 
that this is our goal.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.510
It's so divine and beautiful...

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.770
An entire spring of emerald green.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.700
What's up, Senku?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.780
Is this not our goal?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.470
No, it is.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.740
This is perfect.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.210
It's this green water that 
we're here to collect.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.460
But the geography bugs me.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.260
The poison gases that form here,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.670
hydrogen sulfide and sulfur 
dioxide, are heavier than air.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.900
They settle in dips like this one.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.530
Is that what the silver spear's 
supposed to warn us about?

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.560
Yeah.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.140
Silver reacts with hydrogen sulfide 
and turns black instantly...

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.120
Get back, Ginro!

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.350
How could you tell?!

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.390
I was so close to giving you eternal slumber!

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.620
Go away!

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.990
Calm down! There's no one there!

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.570
There's no one there, Ginro!

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.670
It melted.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.080
The bird's wing...

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.300
What's the deal with this 
spring's water, Senku?!

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.510
It was discovered around the 8th century, 
in the midst of alchemy research.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.220
In my time, it was a chemical 
that served as the foundation

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.420
for all kinds of chemical industries...

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.800
Sulfuric acid.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.030
And we can't make the cure-all drug for 
Ruri without this sulfuric acid stuff?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.270
Nope.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.990
We need to secure a source 
of sulfuric acid anyway,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.260
or chemistry won't develop any further.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.910
We'll have to push our way 
through to gather some.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.030
I'll risk my life as many times 
as it takes to save Ruri-nee.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.930
With my speed...

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.800
Back in my age, there was a group

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.540
that went to do research around an 
area of sulfuric acid like this one.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.350
The man in front knelt for a moment, 
maybe to tie his shoelaces.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.800
Sensei, what's wrong?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.300
He was dead.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.300
There was hydrogen sulfide at 
his head's height when he knelt.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.020
This is an accident that actually happened.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.810
Humans don't stand a chance when 
Mother Nature wants us dead.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.790
It doesn't matter how stupidly 
fast you are, Kohaku.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.250
Then what are we supposed to do, Senku?

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.550
I have to save Ruri-nee, no matter what!

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.690
What else?

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.610
We're going to make gas masks.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:48.370
The only way to fight a chemical 
enemy is with chemistry.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.880
We'll have to see how much poison 
we can breathe through this.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.300
We can't rely on trial and error this time.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.890
An error would mean our death.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.780
All right, my mask's next.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.310
You won't need one.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.200
Chrome, you aren't coming with 
us to get sulfuric acid anymore.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.320
Stay here.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
What? Where's this coming fr—

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.550
Shut up and listen.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.830
These gas masks aren't guaranteed to work.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.030
Who's going to save Ruri if 
all the scientists go down?

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.980
All humans die eventually.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.340
But knowledge doesn't.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.950
It's been passed down for two million years.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.050
Listen up, Chrome.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.110
I'm going to pass down 
all the science I know,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.810
all two million years of human 
civilization, to you, right now.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.700
Wait, wait, hang on! It's too soon!

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.640
Quit talking like I'm 
replacing you or something!

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.960
Jeez, that's so ominous!

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.940
Well, aren't you kind?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.230
What are you, my girlfriend?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.410
I don't have one millimeter 
of interest in dying, so relax.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.010
But the only way to cure Ruri's disease is to

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.920
charge into the poison gas 
and get some sulfuric acid.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.050
If the two of us <i>do</i> go down 
together, in that instant,

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.170
all science will disappear 
from the face of the Earth.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.280
So I'm staying behind in case you die.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.430
Yeah, after I pass down all 
my knowledge of science.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.280
I'm not taking it, if that's the case!

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.760
What are you, a kid?

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.400
Don't get so fussy about staying home—

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.710
That's not the point!

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.700
I have no intention of 
helping you with a plan

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.210
that makes it okay for my friend to die!

00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.590
Sorry to disappoint you, Senku, 
but I'm not taking your knowledge.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.740
So if you croak, it's game over for science!

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.380
You're coming back alive, ten billion percent!

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.190
You have to, Senku!

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.720
Besides, why are you, 
the key figure of science,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.070
doing the raid through the poison gas?

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.300
Just use me or someone else.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.780
Senku, that's what you would call "logical."

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.960
And yet, you're like, 
"Chrome, you're staying at home."

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.080
You seem to think you need to protect me.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.090
What am I, your kid?

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.960
Don't patronize me, asshole.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.450
I'm not patronizing anyone, idiot.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.590
My reasoning is logical.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.290
I know everything about 
how the gas mask works

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.550
and about the materials we're going 
to get, so our best bet is for me to go.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.480
That's all.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.580
That's not our best bet!

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.000
The best bet is for us 
science users to tag team.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.110
We can save each other 
if it comes to that.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.620
Am I wrong?

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.980
When it comes to "that," we'll already 
be dead from the poison gas.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.900
There's no saving each other.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.920
B-But there might be, like, an "Oh, shit, 
my leg's cramping!" type of situation!

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.930
Yeah, you're right.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:27.800
It might be just 0.1 percent, but it 
would raise my chances of survival.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.700
Taiju and Yuzuriha, was it?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.660
They're in the Tsukasa Empire as spies, right?

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.840
Aren't <i>they</i> putting their lives on the line?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.690
Aren't you and they trusting 
your lives to each other?

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.260
If I'm your friend,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:47.910
neither higher nor lower than you, 
it's not "I'll protect you."

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.700
That's the wrong line!

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:01.800
Damn it, now we have to make 
another gas mask, thanks to you.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.910
Chrome, you can trust me with your life.

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.910
Yeah.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.930
Same to you, Senku.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.020
Kohaku, now that Mother is dead, 
I have to tell you something important.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.530
Do you know what the most important 
duty of the priestess is?

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.950
The Hundred Tales.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.680
The knowledge kept within the 
hundred stories must be passed down

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.290
from generation to generation, without fail.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.910
You must understand, Kohaku.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.000
Ruri won't live long.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.300
We must avoid the breach of 
the Hundred Tales at any cost.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.430
You're healthy.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.660
You must be the next priestess after Ruri...

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.950
I'm not going to be the 
successor, if that's the case.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:57.190
I have no intention of helping with a 
plan that makes it okay for Ruri to die!

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.730
Where are you going, Kohaku?!

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.560
If I'm in a position to take 
on the priestess's role,

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.410
Ruri-nee will have no reason to keep going.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.660
That's it! I just need to make Father hate me.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.000
I'll be a rambunctious girl.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.620
Someone utterly unfit 
to become the priestess.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.950
I'll carry the healing water.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:27.840
However many thousands of times 
I have to do it, I'll cure Ruri-nee!

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.580
Chrome, you and I are alike.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:41.400
Everyone would be mighty happy if 
Ruri-nee were to marry a man like you.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.170
But the heavens didn't bless 
you with the ability to fight.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.700
God's not very considerate, is He?

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:55.610
If all goes according to our plan, 
Ruri-nee will be marrying Kinro or Ginro.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:02.080
If it'd be any consolation, would you 
want me to be your wife in her stead?

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.590
You're nothing alike.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.780
Ruri's ladylike, but you're a gorilla.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.680
See? Gorilla.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.430
What was that about, anyway?

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.120
Do you have a crush on me or something?

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.300
Not in the slightest.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.490
I didn't think so.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.750
So don't say stuff like that.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.150
This is the same as when we 
made Edison's light bulb.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.780
First, we steam-roast some bamboo.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.410
You can use glass that way, too?

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.220
Add potassium carbonate, 
which is extracted from ash.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.700
We also used this to make ramen.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.630
That gives us this black powder,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.390
activated charcoal, mixed well 
with potassium carbonate.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.710
It'll neutralize and catch the poison gas.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.110
Now we have a chemical 
barrier against poison gas!

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.470
Acquired gas mask!!

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:59.870
Time for the two of us science 
users to tag team for a rematch!

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.400
We're gonna get over the greatest hurdle

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.980
and bring home some sulfuric 
acid for the cure-all drug.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.460
This is totally the curse of 
that fairy from the spring!

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.290
That bird died!

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.890
My silver spear turned black!

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.470
I'm never going back there again!

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.510
Damn it, Ginro...

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.770
Come on, let's go!

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.130
Whatever. Just stay at home.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.720
You'll only slow us down.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.370
But that's not a curse.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.520
It's science.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.830
Rub the black sulfuric acid sludge

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.590
with some kind of alkaline base, 
and it'll turn silver again.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:52.360
Even rubbing it against 
the warm ashes will do it.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.360
The poison gas sensor's back!

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.620
Let's get going to the sulfuric acid spring.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.550
He was dead.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.780
There are no do-overs.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.610
Do we really stand a chance against 
this instant-death poison gas?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.130
Holy crap!

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.720
Are you seriously just walking up to it?!

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.670
If you stand around huffing 
and puffing in fear,

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.090
you'll end up overwhelming the 
gas mask's ability to clean the air.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.300
It's a ridiculously simple concept.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.060
Freak out too much, and you die.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.730
Now you know. Come on.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.360
I get the reasoning, but...

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.830
Damn it, Senku, I'm not as ballsy as you—

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:09.160
Sheesh, why am I sitting 
here helping you again?

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.230
Senku and Chrome are both wrong.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.170
How is it not scary?!

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.660
You might die!

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.750
Jeez, I hate it when people do that!

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.330
They act all brave, 
but they're actually reckless!

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.200
Considering you'd rather run 
your mouth than shut up and run,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.710
I'm guessing you feel like 
a loser for being so weak.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.460
I don't...

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.920
Don't worry, Ginro.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.010
You aren't weak at all.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.140
Fear is the secret to a long life.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.010
Isn't it convincing when an 
old fogy tells you that?

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.520
I used to be a wimp myself.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.870
They're really scared inside, too.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.610
No one is immune to fear.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.820
That's right.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.820
I hadn't thought about it before,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.470
but imagine how scary it must be

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:08.650
for Kinro, with his fuzzy eyes, 
to go up against Magma.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.980
But we try to overcome fear for 
the sake of something dear to us,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.340
using reason and willpower.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.340
That's what it looks like to me, at least.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.430
I want to save my sister's life.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:38.780
Whoops, I got carried away 
and made another gas mask.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.750
I guess I'll leave it here, 
since I have no use for it.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.970
Senku!

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.720
The end of your gas mask is melting! 
It's about to come loose!

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.220
That was a close one.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.060
Good thing we came here together—

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.590
Shit.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.320
This is actually bad.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.890
Senku's trying to catch up to me.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.170
Don't bother.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.900
There's no chance in hell.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.550
Damn it! It was such a small mistake...

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.790
Take care of Ruri for me.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.500
Ginro!

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.310
You're too heavy!

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.380
Control your breathing, Ginro!

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.610
Your gas mask can't keep 
up with your air intake.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.330
It can't?

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.700
Is the poison gas going to kill me?

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.770
Am I going to die right now?

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.040
All the activated charcoal and 
potassium carbonate will keep you

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.940
safe from the poison gas, I promise!

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.580
As long as you control your breath!

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.250
You can win against the fear!

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.450
Isn't that how you came all the way here?

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.880
Yo, Ginro.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.800
Think with this... and with this.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.600
No matter how powerful nature is,

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.810
nature doesn't have a heart 
or a mind to think with!

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:35.670
That's all we humans have going for us!

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.090
Right.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.940
I'm Ginro the bodyguard.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.280
I'll overcome my fear with
my head and my heart.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.690
The tag team between 
Senku and me, the scientists...

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.470
...and Ginro, the bodyguard...

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.290
...has overcome the greatest hurdle 
to making the cure-all drug.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.560
We've obtained sulfuric acid!

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.760
Yeah!

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:21.020
Acquired sulfuric acid!!

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.510
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.970
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.800
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.720
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.180
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.690
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.810
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.690
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:05.400
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.900
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.490
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.820
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.910
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:20.460
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.840
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.960
Tell me why?

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.050
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.760
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.300
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.100
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.860
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.000
Next Episode
