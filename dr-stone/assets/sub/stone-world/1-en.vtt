WEBVTT

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.950
That day, everyone in the
world turned to stone.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.760
Listen up, Senku!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160
I've made up my mind.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.980
I'm going to confess the feelings I've had
for Yuzuriha for the past five years!

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.750
Yeah?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.240
Well, that sure does sound interesting.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.920
I'll be cheering for you so hard
that my vocal cords snap.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.840
From here in this science lab.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.410
You will?

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.990
Thanks, Senku!

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.180
Shut up. I'm not cheering one
millimeter for you, you big oaf.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.890
What?!

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.980
Make up your mind!

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.600
And you haven't said anything for five years?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.890
How illogical can you be, idiot?

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.300
I've got something for you
that's logical as hell.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.210
A drug that'll stimulate your
pheromone output to the max.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.640
A love potion, if you will.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.080
Take this, and you're set,
ten billion percent.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.660
Thanks, Senku, but sorry.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.630
I can't rely on cheap tricks.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.800
Seriously, Senku?

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.890
A love potion?

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.730
Like those even exist.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.470
It's just gasoline.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.460
I refined it from plastic bottle caps.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.180
Think about the molecular structure
of polyethylene, moron.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.700
It's just a long gasoline molecule
with a few hydrocarbons chopped off.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.340
You can tell by looking at it.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.490
Uh, no, I can't.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.610
No way.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.360
So... wouldn't Taiju-kun
have died if he drank it?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.120
I was ten billion percent
sure he wouldn't drink it.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.650
Not that strait-laced idiot.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.340
Yuzuriha!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.970
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.720
So, what's up, Taiju-kun?

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.370
What did you want to tell me?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590
A hundred yen says he gets rejected.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.660
Three hundred yen says he gets rejected hard.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.290
Five hundred yen says he
gets rejected at full power.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.060
Ten thousand yen says he actually doesn't.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.270
Seriously?!

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.710
I was afraid that by telling her how I feel,
she wouldn't even be my friend anymore.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.780
I've been a coward all this time.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.740
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.250
But today's the day.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.580
For the past five years, I've...

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.510
What's that light?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.190
Yuzuriha!

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.070
Hang on to that camphor tree!

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.380
I don't know, but...

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.190
What's going on? It's so dark.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.870
I can't move.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.620
I can't speak... Someone help!

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.920
What's happening?!

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.740
Help... Help!

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.020
Help me...

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.190
Mom, Dad...

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.790
Am I... going... to die?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.500
I'm not dead!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.100
I have to stay focused, or it'll suck me in.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.380
Wake up, damn it!

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.670
Yuzuriha will be all right.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.390
I'm sure she's safe.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.180
I can't go down a coward.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.640
I'm going to confess to Yuzuriha!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.330
I'm going to survive by willpower alone!

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.990
Whether it's for weeks or months...

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.180
I'll tell her, no matter what!

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.360
How many decades has it been?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.420
Centuries?

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.130
Millennia?

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.380
Well, I'm not giving up.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.660
I'm gonna tell Yuzuriha.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.260
I'll survive, even if it kills me!

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.460
I broke out!

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.370
I broke free! Finally!

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.540
Stone fragments?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.490
I see.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.350
So it did happen to everyone.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.170
Just how much time has gone by?

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.010
I'm sorry.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.730
This is all I can do for you right now.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.860
As long as the terrain
hasn't changed too much,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.020
I should be able to follow the river back.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.980
Back to that camphor tree...

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.390
Hey, something fell down.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.780
A stone carving of a bird?

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.450
Whoever made this is amazing.
Look at the detail on the wings.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:37.870
It looks so real.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.020
Maybe it is real.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.250
My friend said he saw one
like that somewhere else.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.650
He posted a photo of it.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.350
Poor thing...

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.990
It might be, like, a bird disease
that makes its skin harden.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.960
Weekdays

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.960
Weekends, Holidays

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.960
Hours of

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.960
Operation

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.460
Animal Advocacy Week

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.340
No vet's office is going to be open
before school hours even start.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.190
You never think things through, do you?

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.650
Yuzuriha!

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.570
Besides, there's no way that
carving could be a real bird.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.220
And you brought it to a vet?

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.540
You're so silly.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.870
I'm embarrassed for you.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.390
Of all the people to just happen to run into
me when I'm in the middle of being a dolt...

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.000
Wait... Run into me?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.050
Yup, and here's another embarrassing
kid who didn't think things through.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.260
Imagine that!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.500
Shuei Animal Hospital

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.870
Come on, stop laughing.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.070
You did the same thing.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.500
We're gonna be late for school now.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.630
Yeah, you're right!

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.180
Yuzuriha.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.580
I'd never mistake you.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.270
Even after thousands of years.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.070
You've been alive all this time.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.190
Good job staying alive!

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.520
Well done, camphor tree!

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.070
This whole time, you kept Yuzuriha

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.320
from washing away and breaking apart!

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.170
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.730
Actually, you were the one who
was protecting me, Yuzuriha.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.940
It's because of you that I was
able to stay alive all this time,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.890
alone in that hopeless darkness,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.150
for hundreds of years... thousands of years...

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.780
All right, I can finally say it.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.470
Let me finish saying what I
was about to say that day.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:09.300
The rest of what I was saying
on that day so long ago...

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.330
I've loved you...

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.470
for hundreds of years...

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.170
thousands of years...

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.730
I'm going to save you, Yuzuriha.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.840
I have no idea how yet,

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.130
but I will—

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:08.170
Follow the river downstream, big oaf

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.710
"Follow the river downstream, big oaf."

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.740
So you're finally awake, you big oaf.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.100
You're alive, Senku?!

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.950
Don't hug me while you're buck naked!

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.990
I'll kill you!

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.680
Today is October 5th, 5738.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.300
You slept in for a hell of a long time.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.580
I've been up and working for
over six months already.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.130
So it's been...

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.620
A good 3,700 years.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.190
How can you tell exactly what day it is?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.050
I just counted.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:57.820
How else would I know?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:06.050
Four, five, six, seven, eight...

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.980
Damn, I almost lost consciousness again.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.380
I peak every 800,000 seconds or so.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.650
I guess it's like when you have diarrhea.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.170
Think and count at the same time.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.210
Use your brain in parallel.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.870
116,427,065,530 seconds.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:37.610
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.950
In that darkness?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.720
The entire time?

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.450
Even if I could have awakened
by sheer willpower,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.820
if I'd woken up naked in the winter,

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.810
trying to find food would have
been an instant game over.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.750
Starting in the spring
is a must for survival.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.170
An accurate account of the time was
information that I absolutely needed.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.050
All right, we're here.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.820
Time to stop blabbering and get to work.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.630
Senku, did you...

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.870
Did you build this from scratch?

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.260
I don't have enough manpower.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.800
Just producing the bare minimum
to keep myself alive takes all day.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:26.990
In order to rebuild civilization,
I need a big, muscle-bound meathead.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.770
I've been waiting for you
this whole time, Taiju.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.960
I was ten billion percent
certain that you were alive.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.640
There's no way a guy who was so
intent on confessing to Yuzuriha

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.840
would give in after just
a few thousand years.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.960
You aren't that weak.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.930
Yeah.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.890
Of course I'm not.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.100
I'm counting on you to do
all the brainy stuff, Senku.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.440
You can count on me to do the heavy lifting!

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:07.420
Humanity spent two million years getting
from the stone age to the modern age.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.870
We're going to sprint all
the way back to the top.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.030
I'm going to take the world back.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.350
And I'll figure out the science behind
the petrification and our revival.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.340
I'm going to save Yuzuriha.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.570
The two of us high school brats

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.430
are going to build a
civilization out of nothing.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.340
We're going to become the Adam
and Eve of this stone world.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.430
This is exhilarating.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.630
At least it's a huge haul, I guess.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.350
What kind of cheat gave you that stamina?

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.580
Amanita virosa: poisonous.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.090
Buna shimeji: edible.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.950
Amanita muscaria: poisonous.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.940
You can't tell this one's bad?
It looks like it's right out of Mario.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.900
Next.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.420
Mugwort: edible.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.740
Monkshood.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.150
Who is there to kill, you moron?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.290
Yum!

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.070
How did you season this?

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.710
It's just salt that I pulled from seawater.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.700
Humans can enjoy just about
anything with a pinch of salt.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.420
It's important for pickling, too.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.000
You could say it's primitive
man's greatest discovery.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.180
Thanks, Senku, for everything!

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.290
I'm going to make up for
the thinking I can't do

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.530
with brute force and diligence!

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.180
Time to scavenge the other side!

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.980
Hey, they're wild.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.750
Are these edible?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.690
Thinking won't help.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.350
Eating some will!

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.670
I've seen him on TV before.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.870
He's the "strongest primate high-schooler,"

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.620
Shishio Tsukasa.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.510
It happened to him, too?

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.720
Look!

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.600
Someone besides me and Senku has survived!

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.470
Who left this here?!

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.620
I did, idiot.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.480
It was you?!

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.360
Are we the only humans left in the world?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.130
We'll get more humans.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.160
That's a top priority.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:34.100
What future does humanity have
with just us two dudes trudging on?

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.460
That's true.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:41.710
Besides, why exactly were we freed from
our petrification after 3,700 years?

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.430
The rock rotted?

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.310
Yeah.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.130
Supposing this weird mineral was corroded,

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.850
isn't it suspicious that the two of us
got out at almost the same time?

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.840
Only six months apart after 3,700 years.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.070
There's a logical explanation
behind every coincidence.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.730
You and I both washed up near this cave.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.950
Look at that stuff dripping from up there.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.570
It's the miracle liquid made from bat guano...

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.320
Nitric acid.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.530
What?! Nitric acid?!

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.710
What's that?!

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.600
I knew you'd say that, you big oaf.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.070
I'm not gonna waste time
even explaining the gist of it.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.860
So you're saying this something-or-other acid
corrodes the stone and revives them?

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.090
If only it were so simple.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.890
I've been trying like a madman,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.510
using every method available to me.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.360
So many times... So many dozens of times...

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.320
This is all in the realm of fantasy.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.260
Is it mineral? Is it cellular?

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.070
I don't even have the equipment
to find out anymore.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.050
So there are things in this world
that even science can't explain?

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.290
Here we go again with that tired cliché.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.630
That's why you hypothesize
and experiment over and over.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.410
Science is a slow process.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.950
If only I had liquor, though...

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.380
With the alcohol in liquor,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.740
Ethanol

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.740
Nitric acid

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.350
I could combine the nitric acid
and ethanol to make nital.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.850
It's literally an industrial-strength
etching agent.

00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.630
What did you just say, Senku?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.920
Huh? I said nital.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.520
It gets into the ferrite grain boundary and—

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.650
Not that! I don't understand the brainy stuff.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.160
But "If only I had liquor"?

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.900
Couldn't we make wine out of grapes?

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.090
Not bad, you big oaf!

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.170
Laboratory

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.950
Okay, you can do all the
grunt work from now on.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.460
That makes more sense.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:08.690
Laboratory

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.980
Making wine couldn't be easier.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.690
Crush grapes and raisins and
stuff, put it in a container,

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.030
and just mix it every day until it's done.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.440
Though it would have been a crime

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.620
to make liquor without a
license back in our day.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.410
Three weeks...

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.950
That should do it.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.010
You know, Senku, this would count
as underage drinking, though.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.370
Not a problem.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.490
We're well over 3,700 years old.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.050
Oh, you're right!

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.530
It's better than I thought it'd be.

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.530
Though it's about ten billion times
worse than what's on the market.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.810
I never knew it was so easy
to make with just grapes.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.490
One step at a time.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.090
Things are about to get a
little more tedious, though.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.800
Distilling Wine for Dummies,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.950
starting with brandy.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.460
Distilling, huh?

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.790
No idea what that means!

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.930
I knew you'd say that.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.200
Heat it, cool it, drip it.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.910
That concentrates the alcohol.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.350
Don't worry. People in the
Mesopotamian Civilization

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.050
were doing it in 3000 B.C. using clay pots.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.340
There's nothing you can't do if you try.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.340
This is exhilarating.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.160
Let me teach you, big oaf...

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.010
It's not that there are things
that science can't explain.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.910
You look for the rules behind those things.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.420
Science is just the name for the steady,

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.700
pain-in-the-ass effort
that goes into doing it.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.610
One year since I started experimenting...

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.130
It didn't take as long as I thought.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:07.980
It's a slow but steady effort.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.550
I'm going to beat fantasy with science.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.180
This is exhilarating.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.170
Good morning, world

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.380
Good Morning World!

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.380
Good Morning World!

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.940
How far have I walked?

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.020
Only the pain in my feet

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.360
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.980
The hope for a beautiful view
at the end of a long night

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.200
Is what keeps me going today

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:03.070
The mountains of the gods,
the palaces of green

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:08.090
The depths of the caves,
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:13.940
I'll go the full distance,
there are no limits

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.270
To the ends of the world

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.820
Good morning, world

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.900
Good Morning World!

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.900
Good Morning World!

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.990
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.340
An odyssey turning mythology
into the everyday

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:42.750
In this painstaking journey,
turning over every stone

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.670
We'll expand our world

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.100
