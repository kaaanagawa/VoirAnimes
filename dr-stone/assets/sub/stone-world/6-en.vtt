WEBVTT

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.580
It's finally starting to look 
like a real human dwelling.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.690
Now, then...

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.930
I don't think I can keep hitting the 
ignore button on my exhaustion anymore.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.970
Damn it! A human being on his own 
can barely make it through the day.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.690
Never mind science and progress.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.180
If only I had one more person 
with a lot of strength...

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.890
I've already had my eye on this one.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.520
Right by where I was revived,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.340
I'd seen the uncannily masculine hand 
of a guy who'd been swept here

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.330
from the same direction as me.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.600
Although I've already seen more of 
this face than I ever wanted to...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.670
It's been 3,700 years, huh?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.350
Hey, big oaf.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.610
Now, then...

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.820
Time to get started on the Senku Laboratory.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.510
Yo, big oaf.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.610
What will it take for you 
to wake up like I did?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.620
What exactly was it that petrified 
all of humanity 3,700 years ago?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.580
Alien Technological Attack Hypothesis

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.580
Number one...

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.980
Dude, earthlings are so lame.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's turn them all into stone.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.090
It <i>did</i> work on the swallows.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.340
Petrification Beam!

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.850
Lawl, this is exhilarating!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.760
Some Nation's Military Weapon Hypothesis

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.760
Number two...

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.060
The petrification device 
is finally complete!

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.400
Oh, crap! It backfired!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.400
New
Virus
Strain
Hypothesis

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.400
Number three...

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.530
We're petrification viruses!

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.370
We infect only humans and swallows!

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.610
Rofl, this is exhilarating!

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.250
The only thing that's certain

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.220
is that it targeted humans 
and swallows specifically.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.920
It seems like some kind of insane fantasy, 
but there must be some underlying rule.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.650
Which means I can fight it.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.110
Figuring out the rules 
is the basis of science.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.930
I'm standing in the face of an 
uncharted branch of science.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.300
This is exhilarating.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.470
Now, think.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250
How did I get out of my petrification?

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.650
Was it just simple deterioration?

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.860
If it was deterioration, wouldn't the 
exposed surface have broken down first?

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.290
But the stone statues are 
stone all the way through.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.190
For me,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.960
the surface stayed stone while the rest 
of me changed back into living cells.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.300
It's the other way around!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.820
The surface was too deteriorated 
to revert to living cells.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.050
That's why it turned into a stone husk.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.470
The parts of the surface that happened 
to be less petrified reverted to cells.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.560
That must be why there are 
pieces missing from the shell.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.860
So I wasn't revived 
because of deterioration.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.200
There's some special, outside factor.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.450
The fragments closest to my head 
were on the ground in a pile.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.030
Which means the revival 
started from my head.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.300
There's something in there.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.750
This smell...

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.890
Nitric acid!

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.590
The hair on the back of my 
neck is still petrified.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.030
Let's try it on this stone hair.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.900
Why did only I need nitric acid?

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.140
It's not working one millimeter 
on Taiju or the others.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.470
Why?

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.980
What's the difference between 
me and the rest of them?

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.260
Think...

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.210
I just need a hypothesis.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.610
Think.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.430
Think...

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.640
That's it! I was thinking!

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.900
I stayed conscious for all 3,700 years.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.900
The brain burns through 
400 calories in a day.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.040
Over 3,700 years, 
that works out to 2 terajoules.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.410
Where did all that energy come from?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.200
E=mc².

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.420
Energy and mass have 
equivalent exchange.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.510
It's the foundation of science 
that Old Man Einstein derived.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.800
There's simply no way to 
make energy from nothing.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.220
There's something in the stone that I was 
consuming in order to use my brain.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.680
Which means if I can figure out what 
that was, I can undo the petrification.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.980
Try everything.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.980
Just try it.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.950
I really want to try nital, 
the industrial etching solution.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.630
Damn it.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.030
Too bad I don't have alcohol.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.530
Laboratory

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.530
Believe.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.790
Try, try, try, try, try, try...

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.130
And try some more.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.560
Never forget.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.620
Petrification may be a fantasy,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.530
but the foundations of science are absolute.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.820
I need more manpower.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.460
Take the nitric acid and wake 
up already, you blockhead!

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.430
You're awake, aren't you?

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.580
You've been awake for 
the past 3,700 years!

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.230
You're no different from me.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.620
You don't know when to give up!

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.500
Senku! I...

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.170
Taiju...

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.580
I'll believe in you and wait 
for as long as it takes.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.580 line:20%
I'll believe in you and wait 
for as long as it takes.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.870
I'm hopeless without you!

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.870 line:20%
I'm hopeless without you!

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.850
Come back, Taiju!

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.980
Come back, Senku!

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.600
It stopped raining.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.440
The thunderstorm that was 
keeping us camouflaged is gone.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.850
Don't raise your voices.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.530
If Tsukasa hears us, 
we'll be instantly screwed.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:36.350
You're right!

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.410
He's not coming, is he?

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.280
I'm impressed you noticed my neck.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.260
I hardly gave you a speck of a hint.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:09:00.820
Taiju, Yuzuriha, you both 
get ten billion points.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.170
Good morning, world

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.380
Good Morning World!

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.380
Good Morning World!

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.940
How far have I walked?

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.020
Only the pain in my feet

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.360
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:35.980
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.200
Is what keeps me going today

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:45.070
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:50.090
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.940
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.270
To the ends of the world

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.820
Good morning, world

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.900
Good Morning World!

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.900
Good Morning World!

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.990
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.340
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:24.750
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.670
We'll expand our world

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.070
Two Nations of the Stone World

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.330
Sen...

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.610
...ku...

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.650
Never mind my cervical nerve, 
you just crushed my entire body!

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.420
I'll kill you!

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:05.290
I'm sure you know not to, but don't 
go thanking me for every little thing.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.680
I won't thank you, either.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.310
Welcome back, Senku-kun.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.260
Don't you think the shape on this 
hide kind of looks like a rocket?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.000
There are star-looking things, too!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.080
They don't look anything like it.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.080
It looks like a science flag. 
I bet it'll look good on Senku-kun.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.450
Let's put it on his neck, just in case.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.650
Oh, yeah!

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.150
It'll be even better with a splint. See?

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.840
Uh, I really don't need this.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.200
I'm all better now.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.090
Professor Senku's self-sacrificing 
human experiment was a success.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.930
The restorative effects of undoing 
petrification are too damn high.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.480
The petrification that's given us so 
much grief is what cured you, too, huh?

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.110
You said it when we made soap, too...

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.900
But maybe this petrification is the 
stone of life that replaces doctors for us.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.270
It's Doctor Stone!

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.000
Come to think of it, it's weird.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.630
When the petrification is undone, 
it repairs everything around it, too.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.090
What a considerate
scientific phenomenon.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.180
I've been thinking this whole time...

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.290
Who petrified humanity?

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.470
Who attacked us?

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:36.690
No...

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.050
Was it really even an attack?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.120
If it can fix Senku-kun's neck,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.190
maybe if we piece together

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.750
the shattered statues and pour revival fluid 
on them, it'll put people back together.

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:57.980
I tried that right at the beginning.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.750
They just went back to 
being a shattered corpse.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.940
Why wouldn't it work if 
it's so regenerative?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.210
Yuzuriha...

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.890
Taiju's ten billion percent 
too crude for this.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.770
You're our ultra-skillful 
crafts club member.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.580
It'll be a grueling mission.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.860
Can you do it?

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.990
That really is <i>really</i> grueling.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.380
But I'll do it!

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.910
That was quick.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.930
Craft is all about perseverance!

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.020
Are you sharing secrets?

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.130
No fair! Let me in on it!

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.430
I, um... was saying maybe we 
should go see Tsukasa-kun.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.020
Oh, yeah?

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.770
Tsukasa's place, huh?

00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.930
What?!

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.140
Why?!

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.700
He's the dangerous man 
that killed Senku!

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.040
I mean, he's not dead, 
and he <i>was</i> a good guy, but...

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.540
At the very least, 
he <i>thought</i> he'd killed Senku!

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.160
That's exactly what we 
accomplished in that fight.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.080
Tsukasa thinks I'm in the afterlife now.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.420
Meanwhile, I can always 
know where Tsukasa is.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.720
We'll have a giant advantage in this battle,

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:33.670
if you two can infiltrate the 
Tsukasa Empire as spies.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.450
I gave Yuzuriha the details 
about the mission.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.460
Taiju, you protect Yuzuriha.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.980
Blockheads like you are better 
off not knowing everything.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.950
All right, I got it.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:48.980
I'll do it.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.130
Tsukasa intends to use the miracle water,

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:59.750
revival fluid, to amass an army of young people 
to make a new world ruled by military might.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.770
In order to defeat the Tsukasa Empire

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.960
and stop the mass destruction that 
is the purification of humanity...

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:11.470
We'll have to make a revolutionary army 
that can combat them using science.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.680
But how are you going to do that on your own?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.070
Yeah.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:21.180
If Tsukasa has the miracle water, 
the nitric acid, you can't make gunpowder,

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.360
and you can't grow your manpower.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.650
The answer is obvious.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.810
I'm going to find the mystery people 
who fired the smoke signals

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.250
and get them on my side.

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.650
The problem is that they might 
encounter Tsukasa first.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.670
I'll just have to bet on the 
chance that they haven't.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.630
So, going forward, the two of us 
will be spies in the Tsukasa Empire.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.890
You'll be finding allies for a 
scientific revolutionary army.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.730
And we'll each be fighting our own battles.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.840
That's the idea.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.460
I'm getting all teary-eyed 
thinking about our sad goodbye.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.110
You're both so casual about this.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.220
Guys really are stoic with each other, huh?

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.320
Yeah.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.830
Senku is always logical.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.030
We won't be seeing each 
other for a while.

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:27.210
Not for weeks, months, maybe even...

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.150
Senku!

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.810
I promise—

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.280
Wait, I can't raise my voice.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.840
Hang in there for the 
short while that I'm gone.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.930
Hey, you've been waiting 3,700 years.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:23.420
A few more months or years is no big deal.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.430
We're going to build our kingdom of science.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.540
Rear right, 57 meters.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.260
Yes, you, the one who's been following 
me quietly for the past two minutes.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.260
Who are you?

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.430
Blue eyes.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.010
She's young.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.390
Did Taiju and the others just revive her?

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.410
Or are there other ways 
for people to be revived?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.540
Now, that's not nice.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.020
Shouldn't you say "Nice to meet you" first?

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.530
Shut your mouth!

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.550
Save your introductions for Hell.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.000
Impossible.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.920
She's too young to have such skill.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.660
There's no way the martial arts 
community wouldn't have heard of her.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:04.820
Who is she?

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.870
I saw everything!

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.870
You took a woman hostage,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:13.880
and then you ruthlessly killed the 
gentleman who took the hit for her.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.250
I couldn't hear what 
you were talking about,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.260
but I have no interest 
in your background.

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.310
Repent to the sorcerer gentleman 
until your soul rots away!

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.940
Sorcerer?

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.060
You were just bathed in it moments 
ago, and you've forgotten already?

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.780
You were summoning the mountain's wrath 
with your suspicious black powder!

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.030
The mountain's wrath?

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.550
A volcanic eruption?

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.170
So you may not be one of the revived, 
but rather, one of their children.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.710
Or...

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.550
What generation are you?

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.720
She's of a pure, primitive
people with no science.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.970
I could rule over them easily.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.470
I could kill them easily.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:10.820
There's no reason to attack them.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.460
Thus my immediate goal 
is to return to the cave.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.940
Taiju and Yuzuriha have 
seen how to make gunpowder.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:23.950
I need to claim the miracle 
water before they do.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.490
This is goodbye.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.620
You're... the sorcerer gentleman 
who protected that woman.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.280
You're alive!

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.250
Stop talking.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.210
You can introduce yourself 
all you want later.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.190
Don't waste your energy.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.540
Can you hold out until evening?

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.060
If you're at your limit,

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.260
I'll take a gamble and blow it up with 
the little gunpowder I have left.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.710
But if you can hold on,

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.500
it'll take forever, but I'll 
save you, ten billion percent.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.560
You're the only one who 
can make the decision!

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.410
Decide right now!

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:38.310
Which is it?

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.690
Yeah, my organs and bones are all fine.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.110
I can hold on.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.320
I'd say the fallen tree 
weighs roughly one ton.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.130
To get it to one side would take 
half of that, 500 kilograms.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.220
Assuming my own weight is 
just over 60 kilograms,

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.760
multiplied by 2 to the 3rd power 
to get to 500 kilograms...

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.140
I can just barely make it with three.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.630
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.120
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.300
The bamboo's barely strong enough.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.940
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.830
I'll just have to pack them with dirt.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.870
In my hands awakens

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.310
The passion overflowing

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.820
Just wandering through this world

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.170
Who would have thought that 
soap would be so useful now?

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.950
Your one shining pure

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.830
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:34.620
It's an all-star team of 
Great Professor Senku's inventions.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.550
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.020
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.640
The noise plaguing me was released

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.250
What is this?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.970
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.130
This is science.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.030
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:46.460
It was invented by Old Man 
Archimedes a few hundred years BC.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.600
Why do flowers bloom?

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.470
It converts the measly strength of a 
high school kid into Herculean might.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:51.970
Your voice echoes

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.430
It's called a pulley!

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.100
Tell me why?

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.190
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.900
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.450
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:08.240
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.120
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.310
Amazing.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.410
No, I'm not talking about 
that Archi-whoever's wisdom.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:33.880
I'm talking about your unwavering diligence 
in forcing yourself through every step

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.140
until you solve a problem.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.220
My name is Kohaku.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:47.010
It seems I've taken quite a liking to you.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.040
Two Nations of the Stone World

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.970
