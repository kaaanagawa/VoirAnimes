00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.530
Shishio Tsukasa is a good guy...

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.820
and a murderer.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.260
If we make weapons of science 
before he takes notice, we win.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.040
If he finds out first, we lose.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.260
That's the kind of race this is.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.290
Guns.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.300
We're making gunpowder.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.050
This is exhilarating.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.660
Hakone.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.850
If they make gunpowder, 
I don't stand a chance.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm going to stop them 
before Senku can make it.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.570
Yuzuriha...

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420
I should tell you about what 
happened while you were petrified.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.790
3,700 years ago, when I called 
you to the camphor tree...

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.420
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.670
For the past five years, I've...

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.670
What were you about to say that day?

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.370
Yuzuriha, for the whole time I was petrified,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.750
I thought about finishing what I was saying.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.490
For hundreds of years, thousands of years...

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.950
But here, in this stone world,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.710
with nowhere to run, I wouldn't 
feel right as a man telling you.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.720
Sorry! I'm sure you have no 
idea what I'm talking about...

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810
No, I do.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.660
We have to bring back civilization.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.230
Once we save humanity,

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.070
will you let me finish what I was 
saying 3,700 years ago, Yuzuriha?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.260
Okay, got it.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.570
We'll bring the world back.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.190
I'm sure of it.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.180
Good morning, world

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.950
How far have I walked?

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.030
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.370
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.990
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.210
Is what keeps me going today

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.080
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.100
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.950
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.280
To the ends of the world

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.830
Good morning, world

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.000
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.350
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:45.760
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.680
We'll expand our world

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.050
Fire the Smoke Signal

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.300
We have the three materials 
we need to make gunpowder.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.810
We have them already?

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.970
All we need to do now is mix it.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.730
It's time for our happy 
gunpowder cooking session!

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.480
Kitchen

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.690
Ingredient number one for gunpowder...

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.780
Sulfur, which we can get 
plenty of at this hot spring.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.240
Number two...

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.710
Charcoal.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.790
We can get all we need by burning wood.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.500
And number three,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.660
the last, but most difficult: 
potassium nitrate.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.040
It'll take a hell of a long time 
to make this stuff, so...

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.870
Kukuku!

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.630
I've already made some to save us time!

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.560
I feel like I've heard the 
word "nitrate" somewhere...

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.980
Nitric acid!

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.260
Miracle water!

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.140
You got it from that cave?

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.930
You're right for once, simpleton.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.820
Ten billion points for you.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.130
Potassium nitrate, sulfur, 
and charcoal all go in the mix,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.660
and a pinch of sugar as a secret ingredient 
gives it a little more oomph.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.700
This is glucose that I made from grapes.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.460
Hey! My name is Mecha-Senku!

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.100
That recipe I just gave you is legit.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.030
It can result in a real bomb.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.710
So don't even think about trying it!

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.190
Finally, pound it until it's packed solid.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.220
Pound it, huh?!

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.990
Leave the heavy lifting to me!

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.750
Are you sure that's a good idea?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.100
You might be strong enough to 
make it spark and go boom!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.650
Like flint!

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.860
Nah, you won't get any sparks 
by hitting stone with stone.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.900
Really?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.990
Oh, you're right.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.460
Flint is more than just stone.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.660
It needs to have metal in it to make sparks.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.560
Hot springs,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.210
Hot
Springs

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.340
volcanoes,

Volcanoes

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.210
Iron
Pyrite

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.360
iron pyrite...

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.340
Iron
Pyrite

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.620

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.340
Wai—

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.610
No problem!

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.660
Our gunpowder cooking was a huge success!

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.870
I had no idea gunpowder was so powerful.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.130
Yeah.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.910
There've been plenty of 
accidents where students

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.380
were experimenting with it 
and got their limbs blown off.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.900
It can easily be lethal.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.590
We're going to attack 
Tsukasa-kun with this?

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.010
No, we're going to make a deal.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.440
Tsukasa isn't a mindless killer.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.230
Taiju, remember what he 
said when you went at him?

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.870
Let me get this straight.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.580
You'll let me keep hitting 
you and never fight back,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.320
therefore, don't destroy the statues.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.550
Is that right?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.120
That's right!

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.750
I don't understand.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.870
There's no deal being made here.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.880
In other words, in the right circumstances, 
we can negotiate with him.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.210
As long as we have a gunpowder 
weapon, we have leverage.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.340
But if negotiations with 
Tsukasa fall through,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.740
then we'll have to...

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.540
If Senku has already made gunpowder,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.320
I'll have to...

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.420
...kill him.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.660
All right, it's gotten a lot weaker.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.380
If Tsukasa's after us, there's a ten billion 
percent chance he'll find us.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.230
Senku-kun, Taiju-kun...

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.290
A smoke signal...

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.810
Tsukasa-kun?!

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.850
No, that's in the opposite direction.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.130
Besides, Tsukasa has no reason 
to reveal his location.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:29.260
What is it, then?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.490
A forest fire?

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.440
It's too well-timed to be a coincidence.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.090
It was clearly raised in 
response to our smoke.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.070
You mean...

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.660
Yeah.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.050
This is exhilarating.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.250
There's someone else in this stone world.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.050
More people?

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.710
We have to finish putting out the fire.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.010
Oh, that's right.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.390
No, hang on.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.870
As far as they know, that explosion 
could have been from a volcano.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.480
We need to signal them even 
more before they leave.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.100
I see!

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.100
But if Tsukasa-kun is after us...

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.010
We'll be doing him the courtesy 
of letting him know where we are.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.680
The least logical part of me, 
my gut, is talking to me.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.090
If we start a fire now...

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.390
Which do I choose? Safety?

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.630
The future?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.380
What do we do, Senku?

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.210
Put it out?

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.470
Or light it?

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.870
Light it!

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.380
Fire the smoke signal!

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.070
We're running out of gunpowder.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.490
Throw in anything that'll burn!

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.620
Hang on! I'll go get some wood!

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.270
It's a double-edged smoke signal.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.820
We're letting everyone in the 
vicinity know where we are.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.420
If Tsukasa knows about our 
plan to make gunpowder...

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.250
Senku is trying to make gunpowder.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.090
The shells told me as much.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.470
There are four insanely 
useful ways to use it.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.800
Didn't I say three?

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.880
Senku hid one because he 
thought I could be a threat.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.100
Which means...

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.610
The fourth important use for sea shells is

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.450
weapons of science.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.970
It's easy to imagine.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:35.900
For example,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.650
mass production of potassium nitrate, 
which is used in gunpowder.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:42.900
That's it.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.790
Senku was already thinking ahead

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.040
to a future in which he'd 
use gunpowder to fight me.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.560
"If weapons of science enter the scene,

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.510
I won't be the most powerful anymore."

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.790
You look like you're about 
to throw a tantrum, Tsukasa.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.540
You could put it that way.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.410
If you make weapons of science 
and revive the older generations,

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.790
they'll begin fighting over 
established interests,

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.620
and we'll be right back in a tainted world.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.800
I don't mind getting my hands 
dirty in order to stop that.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.860
So now you have to kill 
Science Man Senku here, huh?

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:56.110
America would be moved to tears
by your merciful death sentence.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.940
Yeah. But first,

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.990
would you mind giving me the recipe 
for the petrification revival fluid?

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.870
Sorry, but I'm not as merciful as you are.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.080
I can only look at things logically.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.570
I don't care one millimeter 
what you do with that woman.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.760
There are plenty of females around—

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.530
Don't try to negotiate, Senku.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.940
You never buried Yuzuriha.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.970
Your best move would have been 
to bury Yuzuriha somewhere

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.330
far away while she was petrified.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.620
That way, she'd never be taken hostage.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.850
There's no way you couldn't have 
thought of something that even I did.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.960
But you didn't do it.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.320
Was it for Taiju? Or for Yuzuriha?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.500
No, it was for both of them.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.260
You call yourself logical, but you 
have friends that are precious to you.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.600
I have plenty of admirers, 
but I have no one I'd call precious.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.550
That's why I win, Senku.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.140
I actually appreciate that.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.070
Washing my hair is a pain in this world.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.100
Don't tell him, Senku-kun.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.690
So long as he doesn't have the 
recipe for the revival fluid,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.570
Tsukasa-kun can't kill you.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.100
I don't mind.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:53.600
But you have to survive so that 
you can secure everyone's future.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.700
The revival fluid is a compound 
of nitric acid and alcohol.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.500
Filter the miracle water from the cave,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.200
and mix it with alcohol that's been distilled

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.170
up to as close to 96% as you can get it.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.900
The ratio is 30% miracle water to 70% alcohol.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.300
If you're off by so much as a few percent, 
the reaction won't happen,

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.210
so fine-tune it using a 
petrified swallow feather.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.610
Thank you, Senku.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:46.850
I no longer have a reason to let you live.

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.090
This should be enough.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.330
Three smoke signals!

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.040
They must be responding to the three 
shots we fired with the gunpowder!

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.980
There's no mistake!

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.300
There are people!

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.510
Senku!

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.770
Yuzuriha!

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.490
Three.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.450
If I let you live,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:33.450
you would let civilization develop.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.980
Will you promise that you won't do that?

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.740
What the hell are you talking about?

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.700
Why would I ever keep a promise like—

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.420
No, you would never lie.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.350
Not to science.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:56.680
Will you promise here and now, for all 
eternity, that you'll abandon science?

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.780
If you do, I won't have 
to kill you, Senku.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.660
All right, next is Senku-kun.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.420
I'm going to space.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.290
An astronaut!

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:27.590
What I want to become

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.530
That's a great dream.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.170
Well, when you grow up...

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.740
No, I'm going immediately.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.630
Then again, I'm just a kid who doesn't 
know the first thing about science.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.840
I'm going to study

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.890
every last thing.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.730
I'm going to try everything.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.370
I can't help you.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.310
But, Senku, if you're serious,

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.840
you can accomplish anything through 
diligent application of science.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.950
Used Cars

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:04.450
I'm sure Santa Claus will 
give you the tools you need.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.960
You can burn things with the point 
of light from a magnifying glass.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.330
What an adorable experiment.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.270
Sand iron and aluminum foil are awesome!

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.220
The frying pan is melting 
from the thermite reaction.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.220
Adorable...?

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.480
The liquid oxygen for the injector boils off 
ten billion percent at a normal temperature,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.570
and it freezes when it's too cold.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.250
I'll have to keep trying with ethanol 
for a while until I switch to kerosene.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.350
What's that?

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.780
It's an ablator.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.660
The chamber will burn out if I don't use it.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.950
Hello.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:30.080
I need a Raspberry Pi, a transmitter 
module, and this thing called a "gyro."

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.820
We'll use a good old Yagi 
antenna for the receiver.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.450
It's what they'd use for TVs.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.320
Senku!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.210
You said you'd try it with a light payload, right?

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:08.470
I had Ogawa Yuzuriha-san of the crafts 
club make us three passengers.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.960
It's seriously embarrassing, 
having a doll of myself.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.460
What are you even using these for?

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.030
It blew up at a really high altitude.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.420
Failed again?!

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.210
Not entirely.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.860
I'm going to space.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.460
I'm going immediately.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:21.110
You can accomplish anything through 
diligent application of science.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.870
Senku, I'd rather not
kill you if I can help it.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.870
I'll ask you again.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.590
Will you promise me, here and now, 
that you'll abandon science?

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.550
I can't do that.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.810
I thought that would be your answer.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.560
What are you babbling about?

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.690
You were going to kill me at some 
point, no matter how I'd answered.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.700
To be on the safe side.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.750
Perhaps.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.370
Do it in one blow.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.970
Making me bleed out forever 
wouldn't be logical for either of us.

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.700
Don't worry.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.500
I'll bust your cervical 
nerve in a single blow.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.610
You'll be knocked unconscious 
instantly, and then you'll die.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.150
I won't make you suffer.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.710
I promise not to miss.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.140
Taiju-kun...

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.590
Yuzuriha...

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.400
Senku!

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:46.020
Senku, if we'd met 3,700 years ago...

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:51.580
If we'd met before this planet 
became a stone world...

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.580
You may have been my first friend.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.950
Maybe.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.750
Senku!

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.540
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.030
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.850
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.780
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.220
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.730
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.860
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.740
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.460
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.930
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.550
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.880
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.940
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.510
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.880
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.010
Tell me why?

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.100
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.810
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.360
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.150
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.910
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.020
