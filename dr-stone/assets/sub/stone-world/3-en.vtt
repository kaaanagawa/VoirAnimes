WEBVTT

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.300
The strongest primate 
high-schooler, Shishio Tsukasa.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.330
You two will never be in danger again.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.270
From now on, I'll do the fighting.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.630
This Shishio guy is way too strong.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.880
Senku, do you intend to bring back 
everyone, including the grown-ups

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.630
whose hearts are tainted?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.380
This is a stone world.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.530
An untainted paradise.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.370
We'll revive only the pure-hearted youth

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.570
and live in a natural 
world owned by no one.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.940
It's a chance to purify humanity.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.280
Don't you agree, Senku?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.790
This guy is seriously bad news.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.580
Then again, if we hadn't woken him up, 
we would've been killed by the lions.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.880
I guess we didn't really have a choice.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.740
He wants to help out the youth, too,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.720
so I'm sure he'll stay under control until 
he learns the recipe for the revival fluid.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.400
Even if it kills me, I have to keep quiet 
about the miracle fluid in the cave.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.680
Hey!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.060
Good news, Senku, Tsukasa!

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.400
We have a full pot of miracle 
fluid from the cave!

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.400
For Yuzuriha

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.110
We can finally revive Yuzuriha!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.990
What's this "miracle fluid" you speak of?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.100
Let's not waste time standing 
here explaining it.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.850
It'll be ten billion times 
faster to just show you.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.340
You'd better feel honored to see this.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.290
Time to enjoy the humanity revival show.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.190
Good morning, world

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.400
Good Morning World!

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.400
Good Morning World!

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.960
How far have I walked?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.040
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.380
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.000
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.220
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.090
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.110
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.960
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.290
To the ends of the world

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840
Good morning, world

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.920
Good Morning World!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.920
Good Morning World!

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.010
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.360
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.770
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.690
We'll expand our world

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.020
Weapons of Science

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.670
All right, Yuzuriha.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.030
We're finally going to save you,
for real this time!

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.910
What the hell?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.710
This is just short of enough 
revival fluid for one person.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.870
What?! Did I take it out too soon?!

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.210
Tsukasa and I will play word games 
or something while you go get more.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.880
So make a mad dash, big oaf.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.230
Thanks! I'll be right back!

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.540
I'll go full speed!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.050
In that case, I'll go, since I'm the fastest.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.230
So would you mind telling me 
where this miracle fluid is?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.530
I should've known he'd catch on.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.090
If he learns where the source 
of the revival fluid is,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.740
there's a ten billion percent chance
he's going to be able to stop

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.540
my Operation: Let's Save Every Last Human.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.590
Did Tsukasa leave?

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.280
Yeah, in the blink of an eye.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.420
He's as fast as you'd thi—

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.680
Let's make the revival fluid and 
bring Yuzuriha back right away,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.260
while Tsukasa isn't here.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.690
Bats...

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.190
Touching it makes my finger yellow.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.570
So the "miracle fluid" is nitric acid.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.930
What's going on?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.380
Laboratory

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.380
You just said there wasn't 
quite enough revival fluid!

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.150
Do you really think I'd set out
a pot that was the wrong size?

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.350
Good point!

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.850
Then why did you send Tsukasa after it?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.890
It was double-edged bait.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.050
I wanted to get rid of him 
before reviving Yuzuriha,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.690
even if it meant revealing 
where the cave was.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.150
Why do you want to get rid of Tsukasa?

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.610
He's a good guy!

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.440
That's why he's too much to handle.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.080
I don't have even one millimeter of interest 
in his grand vision for a "mighty world."

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.960
I find civilization-building 
games more exhilarating.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.610
All right.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.020
You don't need to explain.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.090
Senku, I trust what you say.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.530
Something happened while 
I was gone, didn't it?

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.590
Yeah.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.350
Shishio Tsukasa is a good guy...

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.400
and a murderer.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.440
Yuzuriha...

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.110
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.950
I... I...

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.030
I...

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.970
I told you we're in a hurry, you big oaf!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.250
You just dumped it all over her!

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.120
Couldn't you be a bit more, like... you know!

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.150
Wait, nothing's happening! 
Is this all right?!

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.090
No, it's all right, Yuzuriha!

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.050
But is this all right?!

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.030
It takes time for the reaction to happen.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.260
This is a kind of cryostasis.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.040
It's like a protective coat made 
from trace metals in the body.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.580
Some mysterious mechanism 
causes those elements

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.710
to phase-shift, maintaining a petrified state.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.230
That's complicated!

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.010
Seriously complicated!

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.740
It's just a hypothesis, based on a 
whole year of painstaking experiments.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.580
The point is, if even one part of it 
gets nital on it and breaks down...

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.080
it creates a cascade effect that 
travels across the entire body.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.920
And the petrification is undone.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.020
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.
For the past five years...

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.720
<i>I'm gonna tell Yuzuriha.</i>

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.970
<i>I'll survive, even if it kills me!</i>

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.720
It's because of you that I was 
able to stay alive all this time.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.470
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.860
I've loved you... for hundreds of years...

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.950
thousands of years...

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.380
Yuzuriha, can you hear me? Yuzuriha!

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.760
Taiju-kun?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.560
I'm sorry. I made you wait for 3,700 years...

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.540
I'm sorry!

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.770
I have no idea what's going on. I just woke up.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.510
But, yeah... I think I know what's going on.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.110
You saved me, didn't you?

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:39.030
Wow... Thanks.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.060
It wasn't me.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.170
It was all thanks to Senku.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.250
Senku spent a whole year 
working on the revival fluid.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.420
Sorry to barge in on your reunion chat,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.180
but make up your mind 
before Tsukasa gets back.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.890
We only have two options.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.060
Choose one.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.270
Plan A: Taiju and Yuzuriha,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.060
you two run away right now, 
and live somewhere far away.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.030
Plan B: we fight together to 
stop Tsukasa's murder spree,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.780
using the weapons of civilization.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.860
The answer's obvious!

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.510
We're going to fight by your side!

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.870
Don't underestimate us, Senku!

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.150
Yeah! I have no idea what's 
going on, but I'll help, too!

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.930
I'm not trying to be nice or anything.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.000
It just seemed logical to give 
you both a chance to flee.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.750
If Tsukasa really is killing people, I'll—

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:37.530
Calling it "killing people"

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.930
is really a matter of perspective.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.640
I'm culling them... for the 
benefit of the new world.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.280
He doesn't even try to hide his 
murders from Taiju or Yuzuriha.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.530
In other words, anyone who gets in his way...

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.760
Senku, if things go bad, 
take care of Yuzuriha for me.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.090
I'm going to stop Tsukasa!

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.220
You damn simpleton!

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.170
The guy killed a lion with his bare hands.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.820
You're screwed, ten billion percent!

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.470
You're forcing me to use the 
weapon I've been keeping secret!

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.390
I need to shoot it right 
between them and stop them!

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.800
You're the first person who's managed to 
remain standing after receiving my kick.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.050
Yes... And even more interestingly, 
it wasn't that you

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.610
failed to attack me just now, 
but that you refused to.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.430
Why?

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.620
I don't hit people!

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.690
You can hit me or kick me all you want,

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.060
but stop destroying the statues!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.820
Killing people is bad!

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.380
Taiju, let me get this straight.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.060
You'll let me keep hitting 
you and never fight back,

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.950
therefore, don't destroy the statues.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.100
Is that right?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.790
That's right!

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.170
I don't understand.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.170
There's no deal being made here.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:44.100
If you insist on getting in my way...

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.180
I don't care how many times you attack me! 
I won't stop trying to stop you!

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.930
That girl who was just revived...

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.440
What if I told you I'd kill her?

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.650
I see.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.990
This is why Senku-kun said it might 
be more logical for us to flee.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.300
Taiju-kun!

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.020
So that <i>did</i> hurt him.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.740
He's bleeding like mad.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.750
We'll have to let him sleep for a few days.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.670
Yes. Let's not fight among ourselves.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.600
You protect Yuzuriha,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.520
instead of worrying about statues 
of people you don't know.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.370
And I'll do what I need to do.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.450
I won't let you get in my way.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.670
The crossbow arrow was moving 
at over 200 kilometers per hour.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.030
He snatched it right out of the air...

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.450
Hey, get up!

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.320
Come on! Come on, come on!

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.910
You said you'd let him sleep for a few days!

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.910
Come on!

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.370
You're not gonna go down that easily 
in front of Tsukasa, are you, big oaf?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.250
Of course I'm not!

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.030
You're okay now?

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.090
I'm built to last.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.400
I've got plenty of energy left to spare!

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.630
Thank goodness.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.810
Right! Tsukasa!

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.890
We need to stop his murdering!

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.660
Hold it, big oaf.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.220
I'm not giving up!

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.690
How simple-minded can you be?

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.340
We <i>just</i> learned that we can't stop him!

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.380
Still...

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.280
There's only one way to stop 
a monster in this stone world.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.090
Advance civilization and 
make weapons of science.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:47.260
Such a waste...

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.930
What are you doing, Senku?

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.860
I'm making it look like

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.020
Tsukasa freaked us out and made 
us run off with just our food.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.730
What are you talking about?

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.020
Are we running away?

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.070
It's just an act.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:05.990
If we make weapons of science 
before he takes notice, we win.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.900
If he finds out first, we lose.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.280
That's the kind of race this is.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.300
We're going to go find 
materials to make weapons.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.540
Our goal is Hakone!

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.380
Hey, it's just a huge 80-kilometer 
adventure, that's all.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.380
Two full marathons, huh?

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.420
Five hours ought to do it.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.050
Only for a meathead like you.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.930
The cherry blossoms seem different.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:40.190
The cherry blossoms we know, 
Prunus yedoensis, aren't self-pollinating.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.000
Which means...

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.380
They must have gone 
extinct right off the bat.

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.660
Man, what a great view!

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.370
Perfect.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.930
What's that, Senku?

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.260
A sextant.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.010
It's been 35,970 seconds 
since sunrise as of now.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.430
Did you really just say that 
like it's no big deal?

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.380
Senku counted for hundreds of billions 
of seconds while he was petrified.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.020
This is a piece of cake for him.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.160
A sextant is supposed to tell you 
your current location based on the time,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.900
but the accuracy is such trash, 
it's a complete joke.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.900
Still, this trash is the only GPS we have.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.110
We must be around Kamakura, I guess.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.280
I wish I knew our exact 
longitude and latitude.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.330
Are there any buildings that 
could serve as landmarks?

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.040
Anything metal is rusted away.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.110
There's nothing left.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.630
What's wrong, Yuzuriha?

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.300
Isn't that...

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.650
That area's completely bare 
of trees for some reason.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.110
Kamakura's landmark is...

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.010
I know where we are.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.580
We're at 35 degrees, 19 minutes north,

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.790
139 degrees, 32 minutes east.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.840
Look! Look!

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.690
What's wrong, Yuzuriha?!

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.830
Who made you cry?

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.860
Was it me?!

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.900
No, I'm not crying!

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.200
I mean, it's not that I'm not crying...

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.780
But it's not like that, Taiju-kun.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.750
I just woke up today, 
and nothing feels real right now.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:14.200
But seeing the Great Buddha of Kamakura 
made me realize we really are in Japan.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.050
It really has been thousands of years...

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.860
I started thinking about my mom 
and dad, and everyone else...

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.370
There's nothing to worry about.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.970
We're about to beat Tsukasa 
and save all of humanity.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.870
He's right, Yuzuriha!

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.810
And the Great Buddha just told us the way!

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:49.460
He's stood for thousands of years without 
falling apart. He really is a god!

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.540
Wait, a Buddha?

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.730
Well, anyway, something like that!

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.290
Well, yeah, they made the 
Buddha out of bronze.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.370
Scientifically, it just doesn't rot.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.610
Look!

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.750
There's absolutely no 
foliage around the Buddha!

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.810
It's like he made it so 
we could find him easily!

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.070
Well, yeah, it's leaking 
copper ions like crazy.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.530
It's just poisonous to most plants.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.980
That's it! Bronze!

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.950
We can use it to make mirrors!

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.440
Time to upgrade my trash sextant!

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.270
I'll just help myself to some of this!

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.580
Stop!

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.670
You blasphemous bastard!

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.340
It's a Great Buddha!

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.590
Shut up, simpleton! Go away!

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.760
No! The Great Buddha!

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.780
What the hell are you doing?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.050
I have to protect us from beasts.

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.200
Tsukasa might come after us, too.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.890
We're screwed either way if 
Tsukasa catches up to us now.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.080
It's illogical to worry about him.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.040
I-I see.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.670
Hurry up and sleep.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.260
Resting is part of your job, too, big oaf.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.100
That giant body's actually 
struggling for once, huh?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.590
I'm barely fine!

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:26.990
I'm just tall enough, I mean!

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.430
I still have plenty of energy, though!

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.190
Not to worry!

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.190
Yuzuriha, your toe's still petrified.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.200
Yeah, it does sort of get in the way, 
but I guess it's okay.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.360
It's not oka—

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.230
That's cold!

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.970
Hey, the pain's going away, too.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.470
The revival fluid has 
rejuvenating properties, too?

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.300
No, it doesn't.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.090
It's just that the small cracks get mended 
when the petrification is reversed.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.220
Haven't you noticed we're still alive 
even though our faces are cracked?

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.930
That's true.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.060
Let's head to our goal.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.600
If you want to take a bath 
in actual rejuvenating fluid.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.190
When you say the goal in 
Hakone, do you mean...

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.970
A room in disarray, hurried footsteps...

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.540
Did they run away in a panic?

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.640
Yes... That's what they're 
trying to make me think.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.880
How can I tell?

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.880
Senku, you aren't the kind 
of man to turn tail and run.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:47.470
Why did he lie about Taiju being unable to move, and then secretly head west?

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.780
It's obvious.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.980
Senku is trying to make weapons 
of science to fight against me.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.950
But where?

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.140
We made it to the goal!

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:04.740
Hot springs!

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.010
Wow...

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.280
There's a great view of Mount Fuji, too.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:14.060
You two better not have forgotten 
why we came all this way.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.170
So what's this "weapon of science"?

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.730
The greatest invention in human history...

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.900
Smartphones?!

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.510
You sure love your smartphone.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.430
No.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.910
Guns.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.970
We're making gunpowder.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.930
The stone age was two million years ago.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:38.440
And gunpowder was invented 
just recently, around 700 AD.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:47.030
Basically, we're about to warp 
1,998,700 years ahead in civilization.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.740
This is exhilarating.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.380
Hakone.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.590
If they make gunpowder, 
I don't stand a chance.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.630
I'm going to stop them 
before Senku can make it.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.010
Thankfully, Japan is full of volcanoes.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.470
Go to any hot spring, and you have 
an all-you-can-carry bargain sale

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.320
of sulfur, the main component of gunpowder.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:20.270
It's the birth of our ultimate 
anti-Tsukasa weapon: black powder.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.540
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.030
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.850
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.780
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.220
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.730
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.860
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.740
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.460
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.930
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:10.550
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.880
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.940
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:20.510
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.880
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.010
Tell me why?

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.100
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.810
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.360
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.150
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.910
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.820
Fire the Smoke Signal

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:59.040
Fire the Smoke Signal

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.000
Next Episode

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.000
Fire the Smoke Signal

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.250
