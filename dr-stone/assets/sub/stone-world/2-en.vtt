00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.160
Yuzuriha!

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.190
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.950
So, what's up, Taiju-kun?

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.620
What did you want to tell me?

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.620
I was afraid that by telling her how I feel, 
she wouldn't even be my friend anymore.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.580
Hear me out, Yuzuriha.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.080
But today's the day.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.420
For the past five years, I've...

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.220
What's that light?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.820
That day, everyone in the 
world turned to stone.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.780
So you're finally awake, you big oaf.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.740
Today is October 5th, 5738.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.410
It's been a good 3,700 years.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670
How can you tell exactly what day it is?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.570
I just counted.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.300
How else would I know?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.910
Humanity spent two million years getting 
from the stone age to the modern age.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.100
We're going to sprint all 
the way back to the top.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.060
I'm going to take the world back.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.850
And I'll figure out the science behind 
the petrification and our revival.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.860
I'm going to save Yuzuriha.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.990
I'm going to beat fantasy with science.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.750
This is exhilarating.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.710
So, Senku, who are we reviving first?

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.810
We're going to wake up everyone eventually.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.260
What does it matter who we start with?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.720
Although it would suck if we woke 
up a murderer right off the bat.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.210
I see.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.190
I don't feel like choosing who we wake up.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.770
Taiju, it's your choice.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.530
Thanks, Senku.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.030
My answer is obvious.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.170
Good morning, world

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.380
Good Morning World!

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.380
Good Morning World!

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.940
How far have I walked?

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.020
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.360
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.980
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.200
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.070
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.090
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.940
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.270
To the ends of the world

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.820
Good morning, world

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.900
Good Morning World!

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.900
Good Morning World!

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.990
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.340
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.750
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.670
We'll expand our world

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.810
The time has finally come.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.670
That water's going to undo the 
petrification and revive her, right?

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.680
Yeah, it should.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.020
I tried it on a piece of a shattered statue, 
and it turned back into a corpse.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.520
You're so disrespectful!

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.540
I did try putting all the 
pieces back together first,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.320
but it looks like you can't save 
someone once they're dead.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.930
They made a noble sacrifice.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.360
Send up a prayer or something.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.310
Right!

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.910
Rest in peace, rest in peace...
Rest in peace, rest in peace...

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.290
Sorry I kept you waiting 
for 3,700 years, Yuzuriha.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.800
I'm going to bring you back to life now.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.190
Wait, Senku! Yuzuriha's naked!

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.340
We can't!

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.100
We can't revive her like this!

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.150
Here we go again with 
your illogical nonsense...

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.890
We're in a stone world. 
It's kind of an emergency.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.110
No one's going to care 
if your butt's showing

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.820
or if your dick's hanging out.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.200
Yuzuriha doesn't have a dick!

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.200
That's not my point!

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.160
We have to take her back to camp 
and put clothes on her first.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.850
How heavy is that statue, anyway?

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.790
Yuzuriha isn't fat!

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.420
That's not my point.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.070
I mean, wouldn't it be ten billion times 
quicker to wake her up and have her walk?

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.550
How illogical can you—

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.930
Wait, big oaf!

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.580
Why is there a lion in Japan?!

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.490
Why do you think?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.220
It's from a zoo, obviously!

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.740
The staff must've been petrified while 
the door was open or something!

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.930
If they get out when no humans are around, 
every herbivore in the zoo is on the menu.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.320
And if they go out into the city, 
it's a pet buffet!

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.090
So now they're literally the king of beasts!

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.640
In this stone world, the humans aren't 
at the top of the food chain anymore!

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.910
Why aren't they attacking us, though?

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.790
They've never seen bipedals before.
We must look creepy as hell to them.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.950
We're the only humans in the world.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.500
They're alarmed, too.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.670
But it's only a matter of time now.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.180
Even if we get super lucky and 
make it all the way back to camp,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.520
the best we can do is 
fight them with spears.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.750
This game was practically 
over before it even started!

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.860
I can't let you die, Senku!

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.270
You're humanity's last bastion, 
the only one with scientific knowledge.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.200
If it comes down to it, I'll be your shield!

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.030
No!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.330
Think it over logically!

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.080
I'm the brains, and you're the brawn.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.130
We can't lose either one!

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.380
If we're going to run, 
we need to run together!

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.260
All right, got it!

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.370
You've never even hit anyone, 
ever since you were little.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.330
Your strong suit is fitness, not fighting.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.340
Senku, if we can't outrun them, 
we have one last option...

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.670
I found him earlier...

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.070
The strongest primate 
high-schooler, Shishio Tsukasa.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.970
Sorry, Yuzuriha.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.050
We need someone who can fight right now.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.180
If we do defeat the lions, I promise we'll—

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.200
Shut up already. Let's just pour it on him.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.190
No! We're surrounded!

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.190
They're coming!

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.690
Sorry!

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.600
I'm sure you have no idea what's going on 
after being stuck for thousands of years...

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.750
What's the situation?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.560
Your whole body is covered in stone.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.000
Lions from your nine o'clock to two o'clock.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.130
Okay.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:39.180
You can fill me in on the 
details of the situation later.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:47.300
But I'll promise you one thing: 
you two will never be in danger again.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.150
From now on, I'll do the fighting.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.130
This is great, Senku!

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.080
Humanity now has brains,
brawn, and brute force!

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.410
The Three Musketeers are all here!

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:10.750
I get that, but this Shishio 
guy is way too strong.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.920
Is that a bad thing?

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.060
Isn't it good to have 
someone like him around?

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.720
What if he turns out to be an evil 
bureaucrat with insatiable greed?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.810
He's overpowered enough to beat 
down a lion with his bare hands.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.610
In a world without guns, 
he's ten billion percent unstoppable.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.340
Eek!

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.980
Come hither, Yuzuriha.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.540
No way!

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.420
We can't let that happen!

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.160
Sorry, but would you mind lending 
me some butchering tools?

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160
A knife, or even just stone 
tools, if that's all we have.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.980
You're gonna eat the lion?

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.290
You can eat lion?

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.440
It's not poisonous.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.430
Although it <i>is</i> tough and reeks of ammonia, 
not to mention it tastes horrible.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.780
You've had it before, Senku?!

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.550
When I went to Africa to research Ebola.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.720
What kind of high schooler are you?!

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.790
Though it was in self-defense, 
I did kill it with my own hands.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.220
Yes...

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.210
I want to give thanks to the circle 
of life by putting all of it to use.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.650
That's all.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.150
He's great!

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.830
Aren't you glad, Senku?

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.770
He's no evil bureaucrat!

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.080
He's a super good guy!

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.500
I hope so.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.510
Well, I don't have even a millimeter 
of interest in stuff like gratitude,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.010
but I absolutely agree with not wasting meat.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.120
The two of you built this?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.280
Yeah.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.090
Hang on for a little longer, Yuzuriha.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.980
We'll save you as soon as we have 
enough of that miracle water...

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.440
the something-or-other acid.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.630
Laboratory

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.890
Laboratory?

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.900
I'm Shishio Tsukasa.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.720
You can call me Tsukasa.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.420
Last names don't really mean 
much in this world, do they?

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.050
I'm Senku, the sane one 
who's in charge of science.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.790
That's Taiju, the simple one 
who's in charge of heavy lifting.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.020
I'm Taiju, the simple one.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.090
Nice to meet you.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.320
If you need any thinking done, ask Senku.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.410
What do you usually have to eat?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.010
Mainly wild greens and mushrooms,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.710
and the occasional rabbit for meat, 
when we can catch one.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.420
All I ever dream about lately is eating 
meat until my belly's about to explode!

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.760
Well, you won't be living like that...

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.420
any longer.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.500
I'll be in charge of fighting and hunting.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.800
This is awesome!

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.680
Now that I'm on your side, you'll never 
have any shortage of prey again.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.390
I see.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:58.350
So if you cook it immediately, you don't 
need a fridge to keep it from going bad.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.810
I'm not cooking it.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:04.290
I'm using the aldehydes in the 
smoke to kill the microbes.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:09.530
To put it simply enough for you 
to understand, I'm smoking it.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:14.020
If Senku and I work together, 
we'll have plenty of preserved food.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.830
Now we can finally take the 
first step toward civilization.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.910
We were still at step zero?!

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.780
Hey, Tsukasa, what's wrong?

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.970
Sorry for startling you.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.360
This person was buried under the rock.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.740
He really is a good guy!

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.210
He's a superhero at this point, huh?

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.550
Man, I'm full.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.470
Time for a fun quiz.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:14.150
What's the most important thing we 
need for a technological civilization?

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.890
Ten billion points for the correct answer.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.950
Technological civilization?

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.610
The most important thing we need?

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.160
Smartphones!

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.680
Sure, smartphones!

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.780
Smartphones would be nice to have, huh?

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.020
How many tens of billions 
of years ahead are you?!

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.550
Steel?

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.160
Steel, too, but that's later.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.330
There's something more useful.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.580
Calcium carbonate.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.940
Of course!

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.770
As always, I'm totally clueless!

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.050
Ah, you mean lime.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.020
Yeah.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.020
That's putting it in terms that 
a simple mind can understand.

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.380
The stuff they use to chalk athletic fields.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.820
So we're going to be looking 
for a gym storage room

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.640
to get something-or-other carbonate?!

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.600
Yeah, that's it. A gym storage room.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.730
If only there were any still 
around 3,700 years later!

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:19.010
You know the shells that have been so 
useful for trimming your beard, big oaf?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.050
Pulverize them into powder, and you have 
that something-or-other carbonate stuff.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.650
All right!

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:31.460
Brawn duty, here I come!

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.770
Nothing's as exhilarating 
as calcium carbonate.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:46.150
There are four insanely 
useful ways to use it.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.650
First, agriculture.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.630
We use it to blow away all the hydrogen ions.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.450
In other words, it upgrades the soil.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.920
Second, construction.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.540
Cook it together with sand, 
and you have mortar.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.370
Mortar is basic cement.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.620
We can build huge furnaces and houses.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.040
Third, soap.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.600
Gather sodium carbonate from seaweed,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.590
mix it with oil, and the reaction creates soap.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.420
Getting sick means game over in this world.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.690
This little chunk that keeps germs off of us

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:23.790
is our stone of life in a world with no doctors.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.330
It's our doctor stone.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.340
Senku, you're an amazing man.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.130
In the moment after I revived, too,

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.090
you communicated the situation 
quickly and calmly.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.060
I've never seen anyone as clever as you.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.770
I admire you, truly.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:55.180
A man who praises a man to his 
face is full of ulterior motives.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.470
It's been that way for ten billion years.

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.850
What's your point?

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.520
Oh, dear.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.520
I really didn't mean anything by it.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:13.020
I have a feeling you might be able to 
build modern civilization from scratch.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.080
Yes.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.780
That's all I wanted to say.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.700
Whew!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.790
So this is how you build civilization, huh?

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.470
Yeah, one step at a time.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.130
We're slowly but surely 
approaching modern civilization.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.880
So, what's the fourth thing?

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.380
You said there were four 
handy uses for seashells.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.510
No, three.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.310
Didn't I say three?

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.660
Huh? Did you?

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.060
Man, even my memory is screwy!

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.170
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! 
Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells! Shells!

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.930
We're free in this stone world.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.690
Shells never belonged to anyone.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.400
The same goes for the sea, and the land.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.120
There was once a poor boy who tried to make

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.450
a necklace out of seashells for his younger 
sister, who was undergoing surgery.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.630
His sister loved <i>The Little Mermaid</i>.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.380
But then, a middle-aged man who owned 
the fishing rights to that spot arrived...

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.980
and with him, the stench of liquor.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.780
The boy who was collecting 
shells... or rather,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.990
according to the man, 
the boy who was <i>stealing</i> shells,

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.820
was beaten so badly that 
his face was unrecognizable.

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.890
He was never able to help his 
sister be like the Little Mermaid.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.010
You do know what you're doing, 
don't you, Tsukasa?

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.590
You just killed a man.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:48.790
I know that, of course.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.120
Senku, do you intend to bring back 
everyone, including the grown-ups

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.850
whose hearts are tainted?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.250
Sure, they'll be grateful to you at first.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.070
But as soon as civilization returns, 
the rich and powerful seniors will say,

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:12.980
"That used to be my land." 
"Pay your rent." "Pay your taxes."

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.030
They'll rob the poor youth of our future again.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.330
We must not bring that world back.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.300
This is a stone world.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.430
An untainted paradise.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.290
We'll revive only the pure-hearted youth

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:37.480
and live in a natural world owned by no one.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.860
It's a chance to purify humanity.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.610
Don't you agree, Senku?

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.160
Not at all.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.540
Not even a millimeter.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:03.410
I'm a technology-loving 
boy who gets excited over

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.050
mechs and space and 
<i>Doraemon</i> and stuff like that.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:13.230
I'm going to use the power of science 
to rescue every single person.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.580
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.070
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.890
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.820
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.260
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.770
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.900
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.780
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.500
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.970
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.590
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.920
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.980
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.550
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:24.920
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.050
Tell me why?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.140
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.850
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.400
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.190
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.950
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040
Next Episode

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040
Weapons of Science
