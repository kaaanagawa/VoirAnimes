00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.700
Amazing.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.610
My name is Kohaku.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.370
It seems I've taken quite a liking to you.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.090
I don't like what I just heard.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.780
We just met, and she's already in love?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.210
In this state of emergency?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.580
I didn't say anything about that!

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.970
I'm saying I like you as a <i>person</i>, 
so I'll cooperate with you!

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.920
Oh, I appreciate that, then.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.070
Nothing is as illogical or 
trouble-prone as relationships.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.720
What are you, a new species of 
hominid that sleeps with a sword?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.830
It's because you started 
talking about relationships.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
I like the way you live, 
but I don't trust you yet.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.540
I take care of myself, 
and this habit is a result of that.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.130
Don't take it personally.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.650
I'm not enough of a hero to 
assault a lioness willy-nilly.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.720
Hurry up and get some sleep.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.890
Lioness?!

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.910
I have feelings, too, you know!

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.800
You live like a gentleman, but your 
foul mouth is of another dimension.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.710
I think I might accidentally 
kill you someday.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.770
Then go to sleep before 
you cause any accidents.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.360
I don't want to get killed 
twice in the same day.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.610
You're fighting against that 
long-haired man, aren't you?

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.330
I'll help you.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.930
I can't just back down, either.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.620
Yeah.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.150
That's why I'm making a nation of science.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.340
First of all, I need manpower.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.630
So you want allies.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.260
Then why don't you come with me?

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.220
You have more of your lion buddies, huh?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.410
Yeah.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.890
I'm sure they'll be dependable allies.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.600
I know one man who'd be perfect.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.950
Allow me to guide you, Senku.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.310
Come with me.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.180
Good morning, world

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390
Good Morning World!

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.950
How far have I walked?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.030
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.370
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.990
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.210
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.080
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.100
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.950
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.280
To the ends of the world

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.830
Good morning, world

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.910
Good Morning World!

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.000
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.350
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:36.760
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.680
We'll expand our world

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.040
Where Two Million Years Have Gone

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.670
Hot water?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.630
Yeah.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.630
I take it home to make a hot spring bath.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.760
For healing purposes.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.970
You look like a ten billion 
percent healthy kid to me.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.700
What use does a lively lioness like 
you have with any more healing?

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.220
I'm not a lioness!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.140
And it's not for me! It's for my sister!

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.270
Honestly...

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.650
She's such a troublesome 
nuisance of an older sister.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.260
She's been especially sick lately.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.280
If only I could swap her body with 
my exceedingly healthy one...

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.140
That jar looks like a 
little less than fifty liters.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.790
It's not quite enough for a bath.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.670
How many trips do you make 
with that heavy-ass jar?

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.880
Every single day...

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.650
It's just part of my daily training.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.760
I'm a lot stronger thanks to it, too.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.560
I should be grateful to my nuisance sis—

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.110
You haven't fully recovered yet, have you?

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.610
I can't have you overexerting 
yourself and dying on me.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.820
Hand it over.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.730
Senku...

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.860
You're the one overexerting yourself.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.680
Is everyone other than me 
in this stone world a gorilla?

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.830
Kohaku, Tsukasa, Taiju...

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.030
Gorilla?!

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.520
At least call me a lioness! That was better!

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.790
That's not the point here.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.530
I'm impressed you built such 
a useful thing so quickly.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.890
It wasn't quick.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.850
I managed to use the pulleys 
from yesterday as wheels.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.010
Civilization births civilization.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.060
Applying developments 
is the basis of science.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.070
Turn right up there.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.740
Not that right!

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.370
Look, Senku. There it is.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.350
Welcome to my village.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.880
How many people do you have here?

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.490
I don't remember how many 
retirees and children there are,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.590
but aside from them, 
I think there are exactly forty.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.390
Forty...

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.100
Kohaku and the rest of them

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.960
apparently don't know anything 
about modern technology.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.230
So this is a settlement of revived people.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.230
Which means there must have 
been a first generation.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.580
For example, hundreds of years ago,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.360
there might've been a 
first-generation science man

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.250
like me who made revival fluid.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:47.570
There's no sign of revival fluid or any kind 
of science being passed down here, though.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.730
Where did these people come from?

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.330
Don't be violent, Kinro, Ginro.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.030
This man saved my life.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.990
You can't do that, Kohaku-chan.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.620
That's not good.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.300
Outsiders aren't allowed here. That's a rule.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.180
The chief's going to be angry with you.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.700
It's a simple fact.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.500
The rules are the rules.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.530
There are no people outside the village.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.730
All those outside are criminals 
who were banished before.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.010
Therefore, I can't let you in.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.390
There's no room for consideration, 
even if he may have saved your life.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.100
Oh?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.390
You leave me no choice, then.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.900
Shall we fight here and now?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.530
Oh, dear, it's two on one.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.150
You clearly have an advantage.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.070
You're so short-tempered.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.970
And you make such a nasty face.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.290
Sorcery!

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.090
What is this?

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.670
What are these suspicious floating orbs?

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.680
So that's the level you're at, huh?

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.900
I guess I'm taking all of this, then.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.920
I'm going to get all forty of 
you on my side with science.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.240
This is exhilarating.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.250
You make such a nasty face.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.700
That's pretty sketchy, you know.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.100
I can't stop them!

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.710
The more I stab, the more appear.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:39.720
All right, then.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.040
I'll have to use...

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.300
Special Technique: 
Let Someone Else Handle It!

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.290
Special Technique:
Let Someone Else Handle It!

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.220
Hey, Chrome, it's sorcery!

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.330
Quit freaking out, Ginro.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.780
I'm already here.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.210
I saw these from the coast.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.190
I'd be crazy not to come here right away.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.270
Hey!

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.740
I'm Chrome.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.230
I'm an insanely smart, genius sorcerer!

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.110
Looks like we won't have 
to go find him, Senku.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.700
This is the man I told you about yesterday.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.060
A sorcerer, huh?

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.650
I'm Senku.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.870
I'm a scientist.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.590
Don't let him scare you with his 
cheap sorcery, Ginro, Kinro.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.840
You can make plenty of 
this stuff from coal suds.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.310
I wasn't scared.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.170
You're a fool if you aren't 
cautious of the unknown.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.930
I was pretty scared.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.400
Why are you here, Chrome?

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.790
I have no interest in relying on 
your dubious, so-called "sorcery."

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.030
I don't care.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.320
Do as you like.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.160
But this is one thing 
I'm not backing down on.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.070
No one beats me in sorcery!

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.580
Don't get in my way, guys.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.370
If we fight here, the villagers 
could get caught up in it.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.150
Let's move elsewhere.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.470
A sorcery battle? What are they going to do?

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.680
They aren't going to burn 
everything to a crisp, are they?!

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.340
Stop it! Nothing dangerous!

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.850
Don't get us caught up in it!

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.070
Check out my badass sorcery!

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.860
Rainbow Bridge!

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.340
Rainbow Bridge

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.490
I am the master of flames!

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.370
The fire turned yellow!

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.580
How?!

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.120
It changed again!

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.460
To greenish-blue?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.170
Purple?!

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.090
Amazing. This is...

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.370
...sorcery.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.050
Rainbow Bridge, my ass.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.750
It's just a flame test reaction.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:09.140
You just threw salt, copper, 
and sulfur on it in that order.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.010
What's the copper? 
Copper sulfate or something?

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.590
I guess that doesn't help.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.280
It's the blue crystals you picked 
up in the caves, isn't it?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.170
Oh, shit!

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.410
How the hell does he know 
about the blue crystals?!

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.810
Is he reading my mind? 
Is that his sorcery? Oh, shit!

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.460
Th-That's a thing?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.630
Damn, nature, you're scary!

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.700
"Oh, no, I'm scared! I'm running away!"

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.410
was what I thought he'd say.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.900
"I'm defeated. Please make me your apprentice,"

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.090
was the other thing he'd want.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.510
I thought it would be one 
or the other, but oh, man!

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.630
I was all worried that I 
wouldn't know what to do

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.770
if he wanted to become my apprentice!

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.600
You'd better not be thinking that

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.210
these cheap tricks are 
the only sorcery I've got!

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.900
I didn't say anything.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.540
Just wait right there!

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.330
I'm going to show you something 
that can actually be weaponized.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.080
This one's legit, trust me!

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.920
He went to get something.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.650
Is that why he wanted to relocate?

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.330
So he needed his tools.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:26.200
Ouch!

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.980
What was that attack?!

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.060
A ball of sulfur, huh?

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.260
You put that sulfur you threw on 
the fire earlier into a pot

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.750
and melt it down with heat.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.490
Once it cools and hardens, you crack 
the outer layer, and you're done.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.800
That's a crazy way to 
make one of these things.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.420
A sulfur ball static generator.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.080
It's supposed to be a 17th century invention.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.330
You're exhilarating, Chrome, you know that?

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:58.650
Rubbing it with leather instead of your hands 
will give you ten billion times more power.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.340
This is my flag of science.

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.550 line:20%
Oh, crap!

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.790
His head's all spiky!

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.550
It was spiky before, though.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.060
How does that work?

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.600
Hey, give it back!

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.670
What is this, a kid's science experiment class?

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.610
Such primitive...

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:36.080
Chrome, did you think all this up by 
yourself in this primitive village?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.120
You gathered all these potentially useful

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:42.670
minerals and scientific materials 
in that shed by yourself?

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.010
Yeah, that's right. That a problem?

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.110
Kids collect everything.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.450
They smash things together, 
mix them, burn them...

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.810
And if something crazy 
happens, that's sorcery.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.770
What else could it be?

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.280
Check it out, Tsukasa.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:10.530
Even if you kill me, even if you kill 
anyone, even if you reset science...

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.280
There's always an idiot who'll try anything,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.210
and the shiny monkeys will inevitably 
create a technological civilization.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.120
Chrome, the way things are going,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.390
you're ten billion percent one of the 
people Tsukasa is going to kill.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.850
Your only choice is to join 
our kingdom of science.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.480
Tsukasa? What are you talking about?

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.330
I'd love to have you and this entire 
shed of science in our kingdom.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.230
You're not getting it, jerk! Get down!

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.740
Damn it, I look stupid.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.100
I can't back down now.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.340
I challenge you to one last fight, then.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.240
It's a duel!

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.530
If you lose, you'll grovel and 
leave the village for good.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.210
If you win, I'll give you 
everything, shed and all.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:00.450
Challenge?

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.190
I'll show you some insane sorcery.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.590
I've never lost in my whole life.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.370
Arithmetic!

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.390
Fight me in a battle of numbers!

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.720
I'm pretty sure Senku is 
going to go undefeated.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.560
Shed of Science
and Chrome
acquired!!

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.030
This is exhilarating!

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:29.530
How many years did it take you 
to find all this stuff, dude?

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.740
See that? It's awesome, isn't it?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.520
You may have wrecked me 
in sorcery and arithme—

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.340
I mean, I was off my game today anyway...

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.370
But my collection is the best there is!

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.710
They're all just rocks.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.060
Malachite! Chalanthite! Corundum!

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.290
That one's seriously tough.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.340
I have no idea how they're different.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.300
Why are you two getting 
so excited about rocks?

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.250
Oh, man, galena!

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.550
Lead acquired!

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:00.300
That one's crazy shiny when you break it.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.430
Nope.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.840
I just can't understand the way they get 
so spiritual about collecting rocks.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.810
I used to collect bugs and stuff.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.900
Now I can't even touch them. 
They creep me out.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.560
You even have cinnabar!

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.710
Have fun showing off your trophies.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.200
I have to deliver the hot 
springs to my sister.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.120
Cinnabar.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.250
Also known as the philosopher's stone.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.360
It showed up in <i>Dragon Quest</i>, too.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.340
Heat it up, and you get mercury.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.090
There they go again with their weird sorcery.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.630
Do as you like outside the village.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.680
But take so much as one step 
over this bridge, and I'll kill you.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.240
Rules are rules.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.370
Melt some gold dust into the mercury, and...

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.980
Don't inhale this smoke.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.970
It'll kill you.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.060
And now you have a shiny golden spear.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.080
Oh, man!

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.220
What good will this sorcery do?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.940
It's not good for jack.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.980
But you're <i>Kin</i>ro, aren't you?

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.090
So a golden sword. It's perfect for you.

00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:18.090
I hope you aren't trying to 
buy me off with this nonsense.

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:19.120
Nuts.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.160
That won't work on Kinro.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.020
All he ever says is that rules 
are rules. He's super stiff.

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.620
That's right.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.020
Rules are rules.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.690
Kinro

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.190
Though I don't see the 
need to remove it, either.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.200
He just needs one more push!

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.870
A-Are there any silver spears?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.900
You're like one of those people 
who spend all their time

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.010
collecting materials in <i>Monster Hunter</i>.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.580
Mon... Hun?

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.130
You have plants, too?

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.590
Felworts, sweetroot, canker root...

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.060
They're all used in traditional medicine.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.270
They're all drugs.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.310
Yeah.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.510
I have no idea if they work or not, though.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.190
I've been trying them on my own body 
and collecting the ones that were good.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.900
I'll collect anything if 
it'll make Ruri better.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.620
That's why I became a sorcerer.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.740
I thank you for bringing me the 
healing water of the hot springs

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.710
for my illness, Kohaku.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.630
You weren't here yesterday. 
Was something the matter?

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.010
I accidentally fell asleep along the way.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.110
I spent the night in the forest.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.860
"Accidentally"? Please...

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.560
You need to work on your carelessness.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.710
Jasper, Turquoise, would you 
mind leaving us for the moment?

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.950
I'd like to speak with Kohaku in private.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.200
I can't do that, Ruri-sama.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.710
We can't let the priestess be on her own.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.750
Kohaku is my sister.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.290
Please.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.050
Kohaku, you idiot!

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.960
Your hair is knotted differently.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.930
Something must have happened to you

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.150
that was grave enough for 
your hair to come undone.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.380
Ruri-nee!

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.270
Please don't do anything crazy.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.740
I don't have much time left.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.690
Don't put yourself at risk for me.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.460
Senku, is there no sorcery 
that can save Ruri?

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.710
No science?

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.690
It depends on her condition.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.090
But in this stone world...

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.770
Chrome, I should tell you everything.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.290
Everything that happened 3,700 years ago.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.100
About the world before the collapse.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.780
Why are you bawling all of a sudden?

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.490
What's up with your emotions?

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.040
I'm not crying!

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.410
Wait, damn it! I am!

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.670
Who caused the petrification?

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.910
If I ever see them, I'll kill them!

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.500
How could we lose this?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.910
Our human predecessors

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:23.550
spent millions of years slowly building 
this crazy, technological civilization,

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.250
and it got wiped out in the blink of an eye?!

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.220
I'm pissed as hell!

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.710
It's not wiped out, idiot.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.420
The whole thing's right here.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.730
Where?

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.090
Humanity isn't going down that easily.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.730
Two million years of human history is

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.490
right here inside me.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.650
And right here inside you.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.490
Am I wrong?

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.170
You're not wrong.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.460
Of course you're not.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.360
Senku, I'm going to build this 
nation of science with you.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.500
And I'm going to defeat Ruri's sickness!

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.610
So tell me!

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.300
Didn't you say earlier

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.720
that there's a scientific way to save Ruri?!

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.450
Yeah.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.730
We're making the ultimate 
medicine of science...

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.460
The antibiotic.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.470
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.960
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.780
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.710
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.150
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.660
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.790
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:03.670
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.390
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.860
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.480
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.810
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.870
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:20.440
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.810
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.940
Tell me why?

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.030
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.740
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.290
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:41.080
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.840
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.930
Next Episode

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.920
