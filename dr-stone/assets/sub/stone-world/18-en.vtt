WEBVTT

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.520
No, I only drink cola.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.190
Cola?

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.810
I wouldn't be able to talk 
business if I got drunk.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.460
Now that the whole village is in one 
place, I have a message to deliver.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.620
Yeah, let's hear it, mentalist.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.570
What happened in the Tsukasa Empire?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.590
They're coming.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.630
Tsukasa-chan and his army.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.810
Gen, you haven't actually seen Senku's body.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.850
If he <i>is</i> alive out there,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.310
he'll surely discover the village 
and build a kingdom of science.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.320
That would be the worst 
conceivable scenario.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.870
As soon as we have an army, 
we'll take the village by force.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.750
More ridiculously strong 
men like him are coming?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.860
Probably, yeah.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.380
He's been reviving a ton of people.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.390
We've come to an all-out war 
between the kingdom of science

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.380
and the kingdom of might.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.780
This is exhilarating.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.940
A party sounds like so much fun.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.900
I'd be there, too, if it weren't 
for a certain stubborn someone

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.450
who has nothing to say but "rules are rules"...

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.140
Guarding the village is our duty.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.950
If they were to attack the village, 
they'd do it now, during the celebration.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.650
Ginro, go back and alert the others.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.800
About what?

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.820
If they reach the living quarters
where the children are, it's over.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.470
Ginro, if I'm killed, cut down 
the bridge with me on it.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.970
Huh...

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.580
He immediately realized 
he was outnumbered,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.540
and now he's luring us onto the 
bridge to fight one-on-one.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.510
I like it.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.610
He's very proper.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.470
He's trying to run away!

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.410
Are you scared, caveman?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.850
I never would have thought 
your brain was so melted

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.670
that you'd expect to win against 
a spear on a narrow bridge.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.430
The caveman is a lot 
more proper than you are.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.070
He broke my nose!

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.310
We're sorry, Hyoga-san.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.240
Huh? You have bad eyesight, don't you?

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.620
Tsukasa-chan isn't the only one 
who's really bad news, though.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.660
If he or Tsukasa-chan were to show up, 
frankly, you'd all have to run.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.880
That man who was revived the 
other day is Hyoga-chan.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.520
I told them I'd go in as a spy 
and lead the way, and left first.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.810
But I could only buy so much time—

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900
Guys!

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.770
Bad news!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.440
The enemy is here!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.740
This is impossible!

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.450
How is he able to throw 
his spear so fast?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.790
They're already attacking us?

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.390
This is seriously bad!

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.660
The guy Kinro-chan's fighting is Hyoga!

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.060
Kinro!

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.800
Stop, Kohaku.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.190
Now!

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.270
Cut down the bridge!

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.610
Ginro!

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.820
Let me go, Father!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.740
Fool! You don't stand a chance 
against a spear on a bridge!

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.280
But Kinro—

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.990
Kohaku!

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.360
Think about the children!

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.830
We have to cut it down!

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.180
Come on, hurry!

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.580
They're right.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.140
I have to do it.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.390
I have to cut the bridge 
down to save the village.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.980
That's it.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.290
I can no longer be saved.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.410
I can't do it.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.650
How could I?

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.810
Kinro would die if I did that!

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.010
I can't do it, Nii-chan!

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.890
What are you doing with the iron tube?

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.610
Who would have thought we'd be using 
the last of our gunpowder for a bluff?

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.030
Are you serious?

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.420
You're the strongest one in the 
village, right, Magma-chan?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:02.960
Yeah.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.040
Throw this rock at the enemy...

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.210
as hard as you can.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.110
How am I supposed to hit them with that?

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.940
Why should I listen to you, anyway?

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.660
You don't have to hit them.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.730
You want to take the title of village chief 
away from Senku-chan, don't you?

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.980
The whole village might go away.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.690
You need to cooperate for now.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.820
Magma-chan!

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.980
Hyoga-chan, everyone! Retreat!

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.380
This village already has guns!

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.450
Run!

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.380
Damn it!

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.380
You'd better run, too, Hyoga-chan!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.390
Which means you must be...

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.430
You guys waited too long. 
We've already finished building

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.150
the kingdom of science.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.150
Oh? I'm sure Tsukasa-kun 
will be very pleased.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.810
Yeah, tell Tsukasa that 
Ishigami Senku is still alive.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:24.260
Tell him we've built about ten billion 
rifles with the power of science.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.140
Kinro's dead!

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.910
I'm still alive.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.170
Don't go killing me off, Ginro.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.460
Antipyretic analgesic acetanilide.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.480
We made some while we were 
making the sulfa drug.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.530
And now...

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.870
Here.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.800
Rub it on your wounds, and you 
should be all better by tomorrow.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.610
Tomorrow?

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.490
You're just pulling that out of your ass!

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.690
I'm all better.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.000
Holy crap!

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:06.090
Wait, no.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.270
He's just acting tough!

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.120
He's still nowhere near okay!

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.620
I'm the guard.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.110
I can't be sleeping forever.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.920
There's no telling when those 
bastards will be back in full force.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.690
How are you so strait-laced?!

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.350
Of course he's strait-laced.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:21.550
He's Kinro.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.290
Not necessarily, though.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.810
We can predict when they'll be coming.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.650
I can't go back to Tsukasa after 
being so utterly humiliated!

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.740
Damn it!

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.460
Those twigs would be nothing 
if they didn't have guns!

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.910
Then the best time to attack

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.190
would be during a storm, 
when they can't use matchlock guns.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.930
They'll wait around for a 
storm because they're afraid

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.920
of guns we don't even have.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.290
Gen will talk them into it.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.000
Ah, I see.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.030
So we just wait for a storm.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.420
Setting aside such brain-dead opinions 
about how humiliated we are,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.090
going on the day of a storm

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.430
seems so obvious that we may 
be marching to our deaths.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:12.030
Now that we know Senku-kun is alive, 
the tables have turned 180 degrees.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.520
Let's be proper about this.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:18.150
We ought to return immediately and 
build a large army with Tsukasa-kun.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.300
Are you scared, Hyoga?

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.490
You're a hopeless little twig 
without your weapon...

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.070
Your kudayari or whatever you call it!

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.690
Kudayari?

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.800
This thing with the bamboo tube?

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.530
I've never seen one before.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.550
I wouldn't touch it if I were you.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.190
Unless you want me to kill you.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.930
Sorry, Hyoga-chan!

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.120
The storm!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.540
We attack as soon as the storm hits!

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.040
Yeah!

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.850
All right!

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.390
If they're going to be so aggressive,

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.010
letting them fight Senku-kun 
might not be a bad idea.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.860
We may be able to win,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:03.110
but if they fight the kingdom of science 
and lose, we'll have seen their hand.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.010
They're not worth much, even as pawns.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.780
Oh, damn! He looks badass!

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.580
He looks good.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.010
That cures his fuzzy sickness?

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:24.090
I'm impressed by this 
sorcery—I mean, science.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:28.280
I'm glad Kinro doesn't have 
the fuzzy sickness anymore.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.140
You had new ones made for you, too, huh?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.520
This just feels more right for me!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.900
That's not all the scientific 
battle prep we're doing.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.110
The man in the black mask
is quite formidable.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.830
Do you have some way to 
use science to fight him?

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.860
Yeah. You and the battle team are 
going to be in tears when you see it.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.210
Time to show off your skills.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.050
Say what? That sounds awesome!

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.760
His body gets thick when he gets 
excited about making things.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.910
Let's hurry up and get started.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.330
Don't waste time!

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.140
We're racing against the storm.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.570
Yeah!

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.690
All hands on deck, Ishigami Village!

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.130
It's a powerful wind from the mountains.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.690
It's a storm!

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.590
It only took three days to arrive.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.550
The heavens are on my side!

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.090
Now they can't use their guns.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.940
J-Japanese katanas!

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.690
These are the most powerful 
weapons in the stone world.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.150
The blades of science.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.620
I like it.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.990
The kingdom of science is very proper.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.660
They might be a little ugly, though.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:02.410
I can see perfectly.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.090
This is the power of glasses!

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.940
I have Magma, Kohaku-chan, 
and Kinro by my side.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.300
We can do this!

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.050
It cuts so well.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.800
This is the power of science...

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.930
Damn it. How do these 
exist in the stone world?

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.270
We're in trouble. 
Their weapons are far stronger.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.190
Get it up to 1,200 degrees with pine coals.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.200
When the flame turns purple, it's ready.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.490
Smack the hell out of the metal 
to get rid of impurities.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:43.330
And then fold it, fire it up again, 
and hit it some more.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.010
It's called "orikaeshi tanren."

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.640
We're powering up the iron
by doing it over and over.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:54.180
You do this brutal, 
slow work at least ten times.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.300
Oh, damn!

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.830
At least, that's how you'd 
make a real Japanese katana...

00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.770
But twice is enough.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.310
It is?!

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:05.290
We have modern science to thank for that.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.450
We looked at the crystalline 
structure of metal

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.150
and realized it was basically 
done after two folds.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.370
We aren't katana artisans.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.620
We're going for speed.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.920
Any step science lets us skip, we skip.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.870
What's more important is the quenching.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.470
The blade forms into martensite 
when it's well-done,

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.880
and the parts with plenty of 
clay paste become semi-ferrite.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.130
I don't know much about the 
science, but the point is...

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.040
The blade is made strong for cutting,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.550
and the back is made flexible for parrying.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.200
Is that right?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.270
That's so cool!

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.260
You can count on a 
craftsman to learn quickly.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.820
It's the difference between the two sides

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.660
that makes the Japanese katana 
the most powerful blade in the world.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.070
Katana acquired!!

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.450
Our weapons are broken!

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.710
It's not just your weapons.
Your minds are broken, too.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.200
Though I'm sure that's what 
Senku-kun's trying to accomplish

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.720
by showing off his Japanese katanas.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:25.270
But your katanas are no match for my 
kudayari and my Kanryu-style spearmanship!

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.380
It's round...

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.520
A moon?

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.860
What is that?

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.580
This spearman Hyoga is 
in a different league.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.990
Magma, Kohaku-chan, and Kinro-chan 
are the strongest ones in the village.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.990
Take down those three 
and you win, Hyoga-chan.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.520
Thank you for the intel, Gen-kun.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.560
Not that I couldn't have seen it for myself.

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.940
What the hell is that Gen bastard doing?

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:05.930
Is he an enemy?

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.510
Did he betray them to betray us?

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.560
That bat bastard!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.930
No.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.440
He's secretly telling us that it'll 
take all three of us to take him down.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.640
Hand it over!

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:18.110
That's not yours!

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.120
Then let's go, Kinro, Magma!

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.880
He's not even listening!

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.700
That's Magma for you!

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.410
Whatever. We'll fight together, 
whether he likes it or not.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.900
We'll use Magma's huge body as a 
decoy while you send me up, Kinro.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.460
All right, got it.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.130
S-Send her up?!

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.900
He can still react to an attack from above?

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.150
If I can just deliver the first blow...

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.350
He's twisting his wrist 
to spin the tip around.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.570
I can't see where the tip is!

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.850
The spear tip...

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.050
...suddenly broke off.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.050
A cut that's too precise to have 
been made with stone tools,

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:27.970
and too well-hidden to see...

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:31.020
With enough force, it tears apart.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.770
It's almost like magic, isn't it?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.310
Seriously?!

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:36.940
Who would have done such a thing?

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.320
Kudayari?

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.390
This thing with the bamboo tube?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.550
Gen-kun, I like you.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.800
You're very proper...

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.210
as a dirty bat betrayer.

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.050
What are you talking about, Hyoga-chan?!

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.070
Why would I do such a thing?

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.470
Well, damn.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:08.970
You had me figured out already.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.230
That's my Hyoga-chan.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.240
Suika, deliver something to Gen for me.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.060
But Gen's with the enemy right now.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.240
We don't even know where he is.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.770
A mentalist would have left signs to follow.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.250
Signs that only we'd recognize.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.810
Work hard, Detective Suika.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:55.760
I've only seen these 
flowers in the sun before.

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.690
Why are they here in the shade?

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.450
The forest is my playground, so I can tell!

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.610
These are the signs that Gen left for us!

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.610
Do you know this flower?

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.970
It's not supposed to bloom in the shade,

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.540
so it's perfect to use as a secret signal.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.980
It's called black nightshade.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.370
I used it on the stage a lot. 
It's one of my favorites.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:58.500
In floriography, it means "liar."

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.190
You're a pretty good swordsman, mentalist.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.010
It cuts exhilaratingly well, doesn't it?

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.690
This is the blade of science.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.000
