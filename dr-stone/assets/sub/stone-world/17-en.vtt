WEBVTT

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:11.930
Look.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.260
Outside the window.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.690
At Earth.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.920
It's so dark.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.290
I'm scared.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.740
I can't move.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:43.870
I don't feel anything.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:51.030
If I'm aware of that, my head must be 
ten billion percent fully functional.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.540
Not bad.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.310
Now, think.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.280
For example...

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.810
There should be a delay between 
average times of the last posts by area

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.290
on sites like Twitter and Instagram.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.820
Find those and calculate backwards,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.790
and we can learn where the 
mysterious light originated.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.670
It definitely started in South America.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.550
The petrification beam 
spread radially from there.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.340
I would never have thought 
to figure it out that way.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.830
I'd love to brag, but I can't take the credit.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.230
My son, Senku, uses that sort of method a lot.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.230
Now that we know that, 
it's time to head out.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.240
Hang in there, Senku.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.030
I'm going to save you along with 
all seven billion humans.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.080
A Hundred Nights and 
a Thousand Skies

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.130
Are you really going back to the surface?

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.750
You might be petrified 
the moment you land.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.420
If you're going, then at least go 
somewhere opposite the source.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.930
Like Japan, on the opposite side 
of the globe from South America.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.370
If the petrification beam 
is like a radiation beam,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.930
you need to stay as far away as you can.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.850
Well, someone's gotta 
be a human test subject.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.650
This was my idea, so I should 
really go by myself, but...

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.050
Then we won't have enough fuel 
for the return trip in the Soyuz.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.310
They seat three each, and we only have two.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.490
We need three of us to take the plunge.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.420
Sorry, but I guess I'll need 
two more to come with me.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.870
Therefore...

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.170
Shamil! You...

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.110
There won't be a ground crew to help you.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.200
It'll be an unprecedented landing.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.420
You could even be petrified 
while you're maneuvering.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.170
You have a son, don't you, old man?

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.250
If someone's going, it ought to 
be someone without a family.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.010
Like me.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.730
Eight... nine...

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.740
216,000 seconds.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.530
Roughly sixty hours since 
I became immobilized.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.840
I have great news and terrible news.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.710
The great news is that we've 
landed, and we aren't petrified.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.790
The terrible news is that we missed 
the target by a great distance

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.060
and landed in the water upside-down.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.520
If we open the hatch, 
we'll take in water and sink.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.150
Don't worry.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.500
They lasted for nine hours when 
they crash-landed on water before.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.610
Yeah.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.090
But that's the end of our lives.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.420
Five, six, seven...

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.730
Count the insane numbers 
to keep track of the date.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.880
I have to know the seasons in the 
outside world for when I can revive.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.300
That's all I can do right now.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.180
It may be a worst-case scenario, 
but I have to do what I can.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.080
We have to go down there and 
find a boat to help them.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.220
And where's the key to start the boat?

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.380
How many thousands of statues do we 
need to pickpocket before we find it?

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.450
Even the closest continent—

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.730
We'll go help them from the nearest island.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.230
I don't care if it's uninhabited.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.700
If we can't find a boat, we'll make a raft.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.510
Do you really think we can 
land perfectly on an island?!

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.620
We could be off by as 
much as ten kilometers!

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.780
Ten kilometers is nothing.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.980
I'll swim the whole way,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.370
fully clothed, if I have to.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.690
Let's calm our breathing.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.130
We have to conserve oxygen.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.760
Limit conversation, too.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.650 line:20%
N-Na na na na na na na na

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.150 line:20%
You can feel the music in the air

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.750
Why are you singing?!

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.320 line:20%
N-Na na na na na na na na

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.320
I just said to calm your breathing!

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.780
Sorry. But I don't think we'll 
need our onboard oxygen anymore.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.640
Sorry it took me over ten hours.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.730
You're not young anymore, old man.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.690
Don't push it.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.140
You're way too much of a risk-taker.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:15.700
They're back!

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.730
Everyone's safe!

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.380
That boat was abandoned on 
this island furthest away

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.630
from the petrification beam.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.580
Which means there might be 
survivors on this island.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.980
No...

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.660
Oh, shoot.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.250
Why don't we start gathering firewood?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.380
Yeah.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.390
Bingo!

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.520
The Soyuz survival kit!

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.090
Here we go, the ultimate toolkit.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.550
It looks awesome.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.810
We've been trained really well for shipwrecks.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.490
All right, let's start with dinner.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.020
Oh, I'll go find food, then.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.990
There were farms and such 
by that man we saw earlier.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.970
That sounds good.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.750
You got this, Connie-chan.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.730
Okay.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.880
I'll go, too, then.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.940
— 3 Years Later —

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.160
Congratulations, Connie-chan, Shamil!
You're married now!

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.910
Congratulations!

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:24.750
You look good together!

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.640
I appreciate the gesture, 
but we don't need a fun ritual.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.130
With the world in the state it's in, 
I'm grateful just to be alive.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.990
Oh, come on.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.010
We have to have fun, <i>especially </i>
because of the situation we're in.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.970
There's hardly even any entertainment.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.690
Sure there is.

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.350
Music!

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.770
I'll sing for the occasion.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.010
What an opportunity!

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.110
Diva Lillian!

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.030
How far we've come

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.660
How much we've changed

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.340
A thousand nights and a million tears

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:08.580
Now I can say that I've conquered my fear

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:15.010
If I could go back, what would I tell you

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.980
Wish you'd listen to the truth

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:27.330
Till then I'll be patiently waiting right here

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.430
Sorry.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.660
I just feel so defeated.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.990
All the music that so many geniuses
spent thousands of years creating...

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.930
Mozart, the Beatles...

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.840
When I think that it's all going to go away...

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.220
It's not going away.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.580
We'll undo the petrification someday.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.610 line:20%
Promises are kept deep in the heart

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.970
Humanity isn't over.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.870
At the very least, I'm certain 
that Senku is still alive.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:10.870 line:20%
Bells are ringing so loud

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.720 line:20%
Our spirits will never die

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.720
Yeah... I'm sure he is.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:23.690 line:20%
As long as there is something 
worth fighting for

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:17.730
He's your son, after all.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.890
Well, we aren't blood relatives, 
but he's my son.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.090
He's ten billion times more 
of a hotshot than I am.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.290 line:20%
We won't give up

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.180
He'd be like, "Giving up is the 
least logical course of action."

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:30.630 line:20%
Even if the sky is falling down

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.330
So he wouldn't die, even if he was petrified.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.170 line:20%
Even if the stars crash 
and burn the ground

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:38.660
Even if our generation doesn't 
make it, he'll succeed.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:42.020 line:20%
We'll believe our voice 
will reach the universe

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.050
He'll save all seven billion people.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:46.440 line:20%
We won't give up till the end

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.980 line:20%
We won't give up till we smile again

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.560
Someday,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.950
when Senku is revived, 
he's going to need friends.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.100 line:20%
Cuz we're alive

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:59.470 line:20%
Cuz we made a promise to the world

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.930
We're going to pass along the baton.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.170
Thousands of years into the future.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.200 line:20%
to the world

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.510
It's such a weird story that
I have no idea what it means.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.850
Yeah. All of humanity turned to 
stone thousands of years ago.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.200
You know those stone statues 
we see all over the place?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.560
Those are all humans.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.620
Six people, including Senku's dad, 
survived because they were above the sky.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.910
Everyone in Ishigami Village 
is a descendant of theirs,

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.320
thousands of years later.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.950
Does that mean we're 
all related to Senku?

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.640
Byakuya and I aren't blood relatives.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.030
So only legally.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.010
Besides, we're hundreds of generations apart.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.090
You can't call us relatives.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.990
Hey!

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.300
What are you doing up there? This is your day!

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.310
It's a celebration!

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.410
We have a new village chief!

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.310
You two just want an excuse to drink.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.310
Shall we all go to the feast together?

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.540
Drink up, sorcery user!

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.220
I'm a <i>science</i> user—

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.110
Dude!

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.450
Please, Chief.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.870
I'm not the chief anymore.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.170
My apologies.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.550
To think Ruri-sama is a divorcée, though...

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.510
It hasn't been this lively in a while.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:53.310
Everyone's smiling. This is fun.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.890
Yeah! I'm having fu—

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.150
We have to guard the bridge.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.980
No fair!

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.820
No way, I'm an outsider.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.790
Who gives a damn?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.240
Come drink with us!

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.050
Huh? Where's the chief?

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.460
The story ends with a 
message from Byakuya-sama.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.760
I thought you should be 
the only one to hear it.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.260
I figured it'd be something like that.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.340
If we go to the main islands,
we can find antibiotics.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.410
It's our turn to take a risk.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.620
If we don't come home, take care of the kids.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.380
Let's go back home.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.420
It was only pneumonia.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.500
Damn it!

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.100
It was only pneumonia!

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:01.490
You look unusually glum, old man.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.900
You said it yourself.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.650
We have to have fun, 
<i>especially</i> in this situation.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.540
You're right.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.160
Humans don't need to have fun to survive.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.570
I had fun.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:30.090
We managed to survive because humanity 
had already made it to space.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.780
I know this is only after the fact,

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.270
but I never thought I'd have 
a wife and kids, either.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:44.440
I had so much fun since the 
day we went to space together.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.550
There's something I haven't 
had a chance to tell you.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.160
That day humanity was petrified...

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.300
you forced me to have some ramen.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.220
That ramen I had in space...

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.820
It was so good.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.800
It was almost hilarious.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.510
Yeah.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.660
Humanity will make it back to the point 
where we'll be eating ramen in space.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.170
I'm sure of it.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.050
What's that? A story?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.610
Pearls of wisdom to help 
our descendants live on.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.910
I thought I'd make them 
into stories so it'd be fun.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.970
That sure is something a former 
teacher would think of.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.550
It's hard writing stories in English, though.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.170
You can write them in Japanese.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.900
I want to learn your mother tongue, too.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.580
The Hundred Tales.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.480
Most important is how to manage 
food and how to avoid dangers.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.870
Large beasts and such.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.260
We'll want a story about minerals.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:32.380
Someone might come along who takes 
an interest in rocks and collects them.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.930
The Hundred Tales, story number one...

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:44.500
I want them to head to Japan, 
where Senku waits.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.420
Just as Byakuya-sama had hoped,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.980
someone took an interest in 
rocks because of his stories.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.520
And that's Chrome.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.490
Yes.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.030
The old man wasn't totally useless after all.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.020
This is the village cemetery.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:18.090
It's said that these are the graves of 
Byakuya-sama and the other founders.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.750
They bit the dust 3,700 years ago.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.850
Even if the story was legit, 
you won't find a single bone.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:32.030
And the last of the Hundred Tales, 
the hundredth story...

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.190
...is a message from me.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.330
Hey, Senku.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.120
If you're listening to this story,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.000
it means you've broken 
through the petrification,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.580
maybe thousands of years from now.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.850
I'm doing great.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.950
I mean, I'm already dead 
by now, but... you know.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.830
I promised you a science gift, 
and that gift is the friends

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.950
that the Hundred Tales will connect you with.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.260
The world was pretty fun, 
even after the collapse.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.310
With your science and your friends' help,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.520
I'm certain you can build a 
world that's even more fun.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.910
You won't lose.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.350
You'll rebuild civilization, 
from scratch if you have to,

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.430
and you'll save all of humanity.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.790
Senku, I know you can do it.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.470
I'm going to look around before I go back.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.390
Okay.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.560
I'll be back at the village.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.460
Yeah.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.230
I see.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.990
That was thousands of years ago, huh?

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.060
That was when I was still 
alone in the darkness,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.210
counting hundreds of millions of seconds.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.640
That takes me back.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.280
Man...

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.510
That really takes me back.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.740
I would have been screwed 
without your science gift.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.930
I'm happy to receive it, 
thousands of years later.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.700
No, I only drink cola.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.360
Cola?

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.860
I wouldn't be able to talk 
business if I got drunk.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.620
Now that the whole village is in one 
place, I have a message to deliver.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.730
Yeah, let's hear it, mentalist.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.660
What happened in the Tsukasa Empire?

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:05.790
They're coming.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.800
Tsukasa-chan and his army.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:16.730
It's finally time to show them the 
power of the kingdom of science.

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.020
This is exhilarating.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.960
Next Time

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.250
