WEBVTT

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.150
Your strike is too shallow!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.530
One of us must win the Grand Bout so that

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.410
we can give Ruri-nee the cure-all medicine!

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.490
All right, so while Gen's out deceiving Tsukasa,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.840
let's get started on that cure-all drug.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.930
Yeah!

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.330
What are we making with science next?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.720
There's a material that's just as important 
for building a civilization as iron.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.270
The first man-made material in history, 
synthesized using science...

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.380
Glass.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.230
What's that?

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.830
Aren't we gonna make all sorts of drugs

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.110
now that we have electricity and all that?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.570
Yeah, we are.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.930
Clay pots are no longer going to cut it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.290
for our happy chemistry experiments 
if we want to make the cure-all sulfa drug.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.540
Glass can stand up to 
just about any chemical.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.420
Glass is the foundation of chemistry.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.940
Ten billion percent easy to process!

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.290
Yet it's tough as hell and durable!

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.340
You can even see through it, which means 
you can observe the chemicals inside.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.760
Really? Oh, man.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.410
To top it all off, once we have glass,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.020
we might finally get a chance 
to yank that headpiece

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.450
off of Great Detective Suika 
and see her true face.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.260
11.0
Vision

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.670
Wait, Senku!

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.260
Suika doesn't want her face to be seen!

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.910
Take a good look.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.410
Wow, Suika! You're perfectly adorable!

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.410
What the hell?!

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.170
Good morning, world

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.380
Good Morning World!

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.380
Good Morning World!

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.940
How far have I walked?

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.020
Only the pain in my feet

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.360
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.980
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.200
Is what keeps me going today

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.070
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.090
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.940
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.270
To the ends of the world

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.820
Good morning, world

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.900
Good Morning World!

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.900
Good Morning World!

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.990
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.340
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.750
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
We'll expand our world

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.930
I have the fuzzy sickness in my eyes.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.170
Everything looks fuzzy to me,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.650
so I end up looking like this when I try 
really hard to see, and it's embarrassing.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.710
But with this mask, for some reason, 
it's a little easier to see!

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.950
Yeah, that's the pinhole effect.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.890
Nearsighted

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.890 line:20%
If you look at an object through a small hole,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.790
Normal

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.780 line:20%
the light passing through it narrows,
bringing it into focus.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.100
What does glass have to do 
with Suika's fuzzy sickness?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.340
It has ten billion percent to do with it!

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.910
Listen up, Suika.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.610
You're nearsighted as hell.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.640
That's not a disease.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.850
It's not even a defect.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.550
In a technological civilization, 
it doesn't even bother anyone.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.900
We have eyes of science, made from glass.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.270
They're called glasses, 
and they solve everything.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.540
Science users can make eyes?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.700
That's so amazing.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.950
Yeah.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.100
If I could, I'd love to see 
the beauty of the world, too.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.650
Even if it's just once.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.830
I want to meet you guys 
without the fuzziness.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.730
I want to meet the real you, just once.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.460
All right.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.710
Let's make this glass stuff!

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.610
Yeah.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.270
What do we need to gather, Senku?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.740
Glass is made mostly from quartz sand.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.170
I didn't see any in the 
Chrome Collection, actually.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.370
I'm not going to collect <i>sand</i>.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.870
I did see a hint that'll lead 
us to quartz sand, though.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.710
This was the place.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.500
This is where I found this 
translucent rock as a kid.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.090
That little tidbit is worth a ton.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.980
That translucent rock, that crystal,

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.310
tends to be found in areas of 
decayed granite, like this place.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.800
And all this sand here is 
the raw material for glass:

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.650
quartz sand.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.010
Yo, the white grains are 
falling out like crazy!

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.570
This is fun!

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.660
We'll get loads here.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.450
Try to gather the see-through ones.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.920
We grind down all the quartz 
sand into fine grains.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.470
Then we mix it with a bunch of other 
stuff and melt it in the stove.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.020
What else do we need?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.930
We already have everything we need.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.580
Thanks to all of our efforts so far.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.150
Ten percent calcium carbonate, or sea shells.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.730
Twenty percent cooked seaweed.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.990
We used all this stuff when we made soap.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.860
Now...

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.420
All right! Galena!

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.580
Lead acquired!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:46.580
We just need to throw in some lead, 
and we have super see-through lens glass.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.700
It's shiny and see-through, like ice!

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.510
It's like a gem.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.590
That's a weird-looking tool.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.230
We'd die if we tried 
to polish glass by hand.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:06.150
We can use that super tough 
corundum for polishing.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.210
Glass has a Mohs hardness of about 6.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.300
Corundum's is 9.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.180
Polishing will be a piece of cake!

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.500
Here they go again with their stone talk.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.190 line:20%
And the strongest is diamond, 
with a hardness of 10.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.180
I can't keep up with them.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.620 line:20%
Diamond is nuts!

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.870 line:20%
That's insane!

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.760
Suika, can you see what's in front of you?

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.640
They're just sunflowers.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.190
It's not like I can't see at all, you know.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.730
Again.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.400
Why is your final strike so shallow?

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.550
It's your worst habit, Kinro.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.440
Distance is crucial in spear fighting.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.580
If you can't get a good sense of 
distance, you'll never defeat Magma.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.090
Distance, huh?

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.230
What can you do, though, right?

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.070
I mean, you have the fuzzy sickness.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.150
That's why you ended up 
with such a menacing look.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.580
I was born that way.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.940
I don't get it.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.410
I'd just tell her, straight-up.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.660
"It's not my fault.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.300
It's my eyes. I'm actually way stronger."

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.300
Excuses are unbecoming of a grown man.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.890
Don't tell anyone, Ginro.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.810
You're both surprisingly 
good-looking, Senku and Chrome.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.730
What do you mean, "surprisingly"? Jeez.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.770
Next, we're finally making glass instruments.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.740
Now that Suika's labor potential 
has leveled up super high,

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.870
we're going to put together 
a full chemistry set.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.650
Don't call her "labor potential"!

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.590
Just let it end as a feel-good story!

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.660 line:20%
What are you laughing about?!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.080
Acquired glass!!

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.620
It's time for our fun glasswork class!

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.720
Let's get working!

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.300
We're throwing these black rocks in, right?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.290
I'm going to keep them coming!

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.110
You've gotten even more nimble, Suika.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.400
I don't mess up anymore, 
now that everything isn't fuzzy.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.240
There's white bubbles coming out.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:24.210
This is the foam that's created 
when you burn obsidian.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.870
We're using the foam as insulation 
to make a glassblowing furnace.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.190
Then we make an iron straw,

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.670
then we blow up the glass 
with air, and that's it.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.440
Hey, it was our first try.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.190
When I first started making clay pots, 
it took months before they looked decent.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.670
Months?!

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.970
We don't have that much time!

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.530
I'm worried about Ruri-nee's health, too.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.870
I'm not a glass craftsman.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.450
Trial and error is all we've got.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.490
A craftsman?

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.470
Hey, cut it out, Chrome!

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.510
Who the hell is that old fart?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.870
Come on, Old Man Kaseki!

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.940
We could really use your skills!

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.290
Is this how you ask for favors?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.650
By tying them up for your kinky rope play?

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.180
I'm not lending a single hand 
to your shady sorcery!

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.730
See? He just won't come and help us.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.580
Grandpa Kaseki...

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.500
I forgot to return your lacquer.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.400
Oh, that's right.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:03.470
Old man, were you the one who made 
that fantastic, seasoned shield?

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:07.690
With no iron tools and 
hardly any dyes to speak of?

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:14.640
It was a gift from when Kohaku's father, 
Kokuyo, won in the Grand Bout.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.900
I went all-out when I made it.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.900
Gosh, that really takes me back...

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.990
The construction is ridiculously 
advanced for the technology,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.500
so I had a feeling there must 
be a really good craftsman.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.730
But I never thought it'd be 
such a worn-out old fart.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.470
Is that awesome suspension 
bridge your handiwork, too?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.170
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.210
And you had the gall to pull the planks out!

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.340
I'm never going to help you...

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.260
Wh-What's this translucent stonework here?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.940
You don't have to help 
us if you don't want to.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.700
Just sit there and watch.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.930
You're going to love this, Kaseki.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:09.110
This is going to be ten billion 
percent exhilarating for you.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.420
I see. Heat makes it pliable and soft.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.080
It's like blubber.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.710
What ease of molding!

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.520
Crap, it's too thick again.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.380
What are you doing?!

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.780
Darn it!

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.260
He's not spinning it steadily.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.330
He's never going to make 
a good vessel like that.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:46.900
They're not doing this on purpose 
to provoke me, are they?

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.780
Ugh, please...

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.770
There's no way a man who's 
spent his whole life as a maker

00:14:55.770 --> 00:15:01.790
is going to stay put in front of something 
as drooltastic as glassblowing.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.960
Am I right, Old Man Kaseki?

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.540
This is unbearable!

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.070
You got me good, damn it!

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:16.810
Let me handle this.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.810
Are you serious with those muscles?

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.620
Suika, water.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.140
Got it!

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.130
Oh, man! Oh, damn!

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.540
Isn't this your first time seeing glass?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.560
He's got far more years 
of craftwork experience.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.980
I've been a craftsman for fifty 
years, believe it or not.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.400
I'm kind of a big deal.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.280
There are people like you in every age.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.030
Dudes with true talent, 
who've spent their whole lives

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.620
with their heads down, 
dedicated to their work.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.510
Acquired Science Lab!!

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.910
Sweet!

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.870
Hey, what's the matter, Senku?

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:56.850
We finally have a lab now!

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.500
Show some joy!

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.020
Yeah, sure. Yippee.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.290
We're just at the dawn of chemistry.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.720
Things are starting to look pretty fancy

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.380
here in our kingdom of science,

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:17.230
chock full of attractions ten billion 
times more fun than Tsukasa Land.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:28.540
Kingdom of Science Map

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.020
Long time no see!

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.120
I'm Mecha Senku!

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.890
Here's an overview of the kingdom of science!

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.530
This is the kingdom's home base.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.980
It's a mountain of the minerals that Chrome

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.990
has been collecting since he was a kid.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.740
I've got tons of crazy treasures.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.410
Kingdom of Science Map

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.210
Our familiar gourmet science 
dish, foxtail millet ramen!

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.220
I can eat bowl after bowl!

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.330
It's so good!

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.010
And it's just so good!

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.760
Kingdom of Science Map

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.070
We rely on having power 
in numbers to make iron.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.270
To 1,500 degrees and beyond!

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.650
Hey, hey, this is really rough.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.400
Kingdom of Science Map

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.490
Down with Magma!

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.570
These are the training grounds of hell!

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.800
Actually, it's just an open area.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.930
Friendship! Hard work! Victory!

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.320
You're not one to talk!

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.870
You're the lowest of the low, Ginro!

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.380
The elbow grease generator.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.340
It's the ultimate in green energy!

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.050
Kingdom of Science Map

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.030
Blowing glass with the skill of an artisan.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.430
It bends like clay.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.470
The scorching hot glass is cooled 
slowly so that it doesn't crack.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.210
And this is the laboratory.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.410
We're charging down the sulfa drug route 
with all kinds of insane chemicals.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:15.630
Kingdom of Science Map

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.160
It's kind of spectacular, isn't it?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.230
This kingdom of science 
is starting to heat up.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.650
We've only made the bare essentials.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:30.510
We wouldn't get anywhere if we 
were missing any one of these.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.150
Was the technology even crazier 
before the world collapsed?

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.650
Yeah.

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.400
It took two million years to get there.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.550
And we're going to catch up and run past it.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.450
Our first step is the cure-all sulfa drug.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.680 line:20%
Yay!

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.220
Yay!

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.880 line:20%
Yay!

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.660
Yay!

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.240 line:20%
Yay!

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.770
Yay!

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.220 line:20%
Yay!

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.600
Yay!

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.270
The sorcery team's so lucky.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.780
They look like they're having 
so much fun with shiny stuff.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.730
It's not like we're...

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.740
Hey, Kinro, what if...

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.730
What if the spear tip were super shiny?

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.520
Don't you think it would help you practice,

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.950
since you could get a better sense 
of distance with your fuzzy vision?

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.700
What are you talking about, Ginro?

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.830
Huh?

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.120
Hey, speaking of shiny...

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:42.060
Don't you think we <i>should</i> have 
a golden spear and silver spear?

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.730
Strictly for the Grand Bout, of course.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.500
We'll totally need them to win, won't we?

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.180
I don't know anything about fighting.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:04.970
Is it true that a gold and silver 
spear will help them beat Magma?

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.060
Senku, to borrow your words,

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.820
they ten billion percent just 
want gold and silver spears.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.660
I mean, now that you have 
all this... glass, was it?

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.980
And this amazing laboratory...

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.960
I thought maybe you could make 
a silver spear, you know.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:27.220
And then taking down 
Magma will be easy-peasy.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.970
That's right.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.450
Now that we have glassware,

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:34.700
we're going to have to suck it up and go get

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.060
the most difficult material to obtain.

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:39.810
All right.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.770
Let's break in this brand new 
laboratory by making a silver spear.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.860
I'm sorry, Kinro.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.090
I have a way of becoming everyone's favorite.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.500
You aren't the slightest 
bit my favorite, idiot.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.630
This could literally cost 
you your life, Ginro.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.540
We're off on a great adventure to find

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.100
chemistry's greatest treasure.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:13.120
You'll be putting your life on the 
line in a maximum danger area.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.890
You could seriously die there in an instant.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.580
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.070
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.890
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.820
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.260
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.770
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.900
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.780
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.500
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.970
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.590
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.920
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.980
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.550
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:24.920
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.050
Tell me why?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.140
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.850
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.400
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:41.190
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.950
But I'll save you from a wounded today
