00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.190
We've cleared plastic!

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.610
We've cleared wire!

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.990
We've cleared vacuum tubes!

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.120
We've cleared microphones!

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.040
We've finally completed our 
extra huge science project!

We've come so far, building a 
scientific civilization from scratch

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.820 line:20%
Ramen

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.940
in this stone-riddled world.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.070
The strongest weapon in modern warfare,

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.370
delivering voices over infinite distances...

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.170
The cell phone is born!

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.390
Yeah!

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.640
Our voices are going to travel across 
the skies and far into the distance.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.270
It's so strange.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.610
Yeah.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.580
So it's great that we're sending 
our voices over long distances...

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.650
But how are we going to hear them?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.240
Whoops! We're going to need another one.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.440
You kept quiet about that 
on purpose, didn't you?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.810
Because people might give up if 
you told them we need to make two.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.130 line:20%
We needed
more than one
cell phone!!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.250
Tee-hee.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.560
We do need another one to 
make it work as a cell phone.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.900
But if we run a long cable, 
it should work as a phone.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.140
Ruri can hear me if I 
talk through here, right?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.410
Ahem.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.130
Chrome, have you chosen your 
historic first words for the phones

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.830
we've finally built?

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.600
Ruri-chan's listening on the other end.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.590
Come on, it's your chance to 
tell her how you really feel.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.560
This is your moment.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.620
My true feelings...

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.200
Hit the switch!

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.870
It's on!

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.750
Ruri...

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.200
Did you see that, Ruri? 
Pretty awesome, right?!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.460
Science is insane!

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.850
What's up with you all, anyway?

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:52.980
I heard them!

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.600
It worked!

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.600
How does this thing work?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.410
I'm shocked.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.480
That was definitely Chrome's voice.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.490
I don't get it.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.210
How can something so tiny speak?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.110
It's almost like a speaker.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.330
"Almost like"? It's literally a speaker.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.000
Microphones and speakers just convert 
between sound and electricity.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.580
They're the same...

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.350
Ruri.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.220
What did you just say?

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.210
"It's almost like a speaker"?

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.210
Huh, a speaker?

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.020
So is this a bee?

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.880
It's a bee! A bee!

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.640
Huh? Speakers are bees?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.500
Um, I mean... aren't speakers a kind of bee?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.410
How did that happen?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.650
It was in the Hundred Tales.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.610
That's how it was passed down?

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.230
Yes.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.510
In tale 14 of the Hundred Tales...

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.990
There's a talkative bee named Speaker.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.340
When it poked gravestones with its needle,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.860
it could speak in the voices of the dead.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.360
Speaker...

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.740
Needles on gravestones...

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.260
Voices of the dead...

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.050
That story isn't transferring 
any kind of knowledge.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.540
I don't get what it's for.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.070
That's super suspicious.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.260
It's using the word "speaker" to try to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.400
communicate something 
only to modern humans.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.710
And it's tale number 14.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.150
One and four, or "i" and "shi," 
as in "ishi (stone)."

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.910
It's your birthday.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.790
It's said that these are the graves of 
Byakuya-sama and the other founders.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.890
My old man's gravestone...

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.670
The cemetery!

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.210
What do you think you're doing, 
Senku? That's sacrilege!

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.980
What? Is there something 
about that gravestone?

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.140
I should have noticed a lot sooner.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.880
That man is such a pain in the ass.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.610
Just the gravestones of the founders?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.620
Now that I think about it,
that's ten billion percent bull.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.990
This isn't a gravestone.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.870
It's a time capsule that's 
been kept solid in concrete.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.810
A time capsule?

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.220
Is there something inside it?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.550
Yeah, we need to break it to get inside.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.210
We're breaking it, then?!

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.430
Hold it, meat head!

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.510
If I'm right, there's glass in this.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.400
We're going to need someone with both 
power and speed to crack it swiftly.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.590
So fast!

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.690
There's something inside!

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.430
It's some kind of silver chunk.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.340
It's silver because it's 
wrapped in aluminum foil.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.080
If we wash it with hydrochloric acid...

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.500
It's actually glass!

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.740
A saucer?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.970
It looks like they cut out the 
bottom of a bottle or something.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.430
A saucer.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.850
Speaker.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.630
Speaking with needles.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.520
Does that remind you of anything?

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.150
It's a record!

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.530
My dad and the crew's voices are on there.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.780
They bothered to leave us a voice recording.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.950
Let's hear what they had to say.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.100
I'll kill you if it isn't something exhilarating,

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.510
you deadbeat dad.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.260
Chrome was right.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.030
Science truly is beautiful.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:09:01.770
It lets Senku-san's father 
speak to him from heaven.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:08.650
Now, thousands of years later, 
traveling through time with science.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.670
Hey, Senku...

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.620
Does that mean that "record" 
thing can trap sound?

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.130
B-B-But you can't even catch sound.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.100
I'm so confused.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.170
How?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.630
The way a record works 
is ridiculously simple.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.550
Hella lit!

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.250
You make a needle vibrate with sound, 
which digs grooves into the record.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.060
And then, if you run a needle 
over the grooves to vibrate it,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.580
it'll make the same sounds that dug them.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.440
Hella lit!

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.530
Digging grooves in glass 
makes it store sound?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.970
That's a surprise.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.950
Senku's dad is awesome!

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.090
Nah, that's not true.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.050
Byakuya couldn't have done it.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.510
It must have been the people 
with him that made it.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.440
Astronauts are all science elites.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.590
All of them except Byakuya, 
who got in by luck.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.890
Although he might have been the 
one who came up with the idea.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.170
He's the only one who'd 
think of something so lame.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.740
I bet we could make a record if 
we used the bottom of a bottle.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.130
Th-That sounds like a good idea.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.830
Glass is a lot more durable than plastic.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.750
Preserved correctly, it could 
last tens of thousands of years.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.050
Huh...

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.790
Did you know that?

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.100
Not at all.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.860
I just thought it could work because it's round.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.090
You could have just said "yes," pops.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:01.970
Well, anyway, that's that. 
So give me a hand, guys.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.540
Hey, they left.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.470
Come on! Be nicer to the old man!

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:13.060
Shamil!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.910
We don't have enough parts, old man.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.900
There might be something 
we can use on the Soyuz.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.120
Hey!

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.210
I found something!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.790
My buddy, the electric shaver!

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.140
Sorry, mister shaver.
Your motor won't go to waste.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.600
We can make a record player pretty 
easily using the things we've made so far.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.480
We'll use the gear from 
the cotton candy machine.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.740
I went and got it.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.530
Destroying Father's shield was well worth it.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.070
It's doing so much good.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.410
Your father's happy as long 
as it's useful to you.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.050
This is how people become cogs 
in society as they get older.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.100
Literally.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.420
No one asked for your words of wisdom.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.420
I'm back.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.750
I use this when I'm knitting.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.600
This is perfect.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.090
A bone needle.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.350
The playback side of making 
a record is dead easy.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.630
Recording is another matter.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.390
You're cutting glass, 
so you need a hard rock.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.490
Like corundum or diamond, right?

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.200
Please, use this.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.430
I don't know...

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.090
It's diamond.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.180
Isn't that your wedding ring?

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.960
You can't. That's too important.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.170
I don't wear it all the time, anyway.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.900
It gets in the way.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.330
I'm sure the diamond will be happier 
serving as a record needle.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.550
But in exchange,

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.470
you have to let us in on building 
the recorder and making recordings.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:15.730
Thanks, guys.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.910
Yeah!

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.490
That took no time at all!

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.500
Record player
acquired!!

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.420
What's going on?

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.840
Apparently, we're going to hear 
the voices of the founders.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.280
The founders?

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.590
The voices of people from 
thousands of years ago?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.050
All right.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.470
Let's spin it, Ginro.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.680
Okay.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.220
I've gotten good at spinning this, 
from the cotton candy machine.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.530
I don't know who's listening to this,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.030
hundreds, maybe thousands 
of years from now...

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.080
But I'm the astronaut Ishigami Byakuya.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.210
Shut up. I can't hear.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.400
This is the voice of the 
founder of Ishigami Village...

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.470
Senku's father's actual voice!

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.220
Just kidding!

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.680
That's it for the stuffy formalities.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.900
You revived from the petrification, and 
now you're listening to this recording.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.370
Senku, it's you, isn't it?

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.150
I can tell.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:55.420
Hundreds, thousands, maybe an 
unthinkable number of years later,

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.660
I'm making my final call to you.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.710
Not that I can hear you...

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.970
Senku, don't forget.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.290
I've always, always...

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.230
Nah, you don't need that dramatic 
father-and-son crap, do you?

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.990
Let's get right to business.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.480
You really do get it.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.060
He's so cold to his father.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.980
You're really not any better, Kohaku.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.880
Senku, if you're still having a hard time

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.970
winning over the hearts of the villagers,

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.820
let them hear this.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.580
To those for whom the 
light of music has dimmed!

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.710
Why a record, all of a sudden?

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.960
I've been thinking the whole time...

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.380
How do we keep all the 
knowledge and fun stuff that

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.590
humanity's come up with 
from disappearing?

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.340
Besides...

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.140
I wanted to leave something that would 
be exhilarating for Senku to hear.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.640
Song...

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.620
But it's too pretty.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.390
It's the voice of an angel.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.460
It's so amazing!

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.320
The song is so...

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.290
It's so amazing!

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.730
It's amazing!

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.730
Your vocabulary...

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.540
Lilian-chan was one of the 
top singers of our age.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.320
Imagine that being the first song you hear.

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:20.940
Oh, man.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.890
Two million years of humanity...

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.910
Oh, man!

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.040
Senku, was there all kinds of awesome 
music like this in the past?

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.640
Yeah.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.340
And not just music.

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.800
Games, TV, comics, movies...

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:44.310
All entertainment that science made possible.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.570
There was a ton of incredibly 
fun stuff all over the world.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.950
The real thing's gone now, but it's all there...

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:58.540
in people's hearts.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.020
I'm going to let all of you see it,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:12.040
once we take down the Tsukasa Empire 
and revive all the world's statues.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.540
I really want to see everything!

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.800
This is so damn exciting!

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.020
All the world's statues!

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.300
Let's revive them all!

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.270
So our first step is to take down the 
so-called Tsukasa Empire, is that right?

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.320
This is awesome.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.400
Everyone's totally pumped!

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.380
Your dad's got skill.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.150
He's motivated the entire village

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:41.470 line:20%
We must defeat the enemy quickly 
and revive all those statues.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.860
to revive all the people 
who've been petrified.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.030 line:20%
Yes.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.910
All with just Lilian-chan's singing.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:51.250
Doesn't this also wash away 
your guilt for having dragged

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.420
the villagers into a war?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.820
I've never had that kind of guilt.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.470
Senku.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.690
You actually made what you 
said that day come true.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.550
Just like you said on 
the day we first met...

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:29.670
This whole village has 
become a nation of science.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.500
So it's finally beginning.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.130
The battle between the kingdom of 
science and the Tsukasa Empire.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.210
Yeah!

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.170
We better get that second cell 
phone built and bring it over.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.100
Which means, Senku-chan, 
those two are finally up to bat.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.580
Yeah.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.350
We're finally connecting.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:59.110
The entire kingdom of science, 
the whole of its might.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.610
It's almost been a year now, huh?

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.360
Yeah.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.130
We're waiting for you, Sen—

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.930
Don't raise your voice, Taiju-kun!

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.370
Shoot! That's right!

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.570
Senku...

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.730
Spring is not far off.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.950
Yeah.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.360
The final battle with Senku is near.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.570
Now...

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:48.340
Let's snuff the flame of science forever 
and build a new, untarnished world.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.500
The final battle against the 
Tsukasa Empire, on our home turf...

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.010
It's the beginning of the Stone Wars.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.890
This is exhilarating.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:31.120 line:20%
