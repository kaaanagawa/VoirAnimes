WEBVTT

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.280
With the gourmet dish of science...

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.670
I can find enough manpower to make steel.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.550
One foxtail millet ramen!

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.560
It's so chewy! This is amazing!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.060
If Ganen the glutton says so, well...

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.140
Oh, man! Oh, man!

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.190
It's so slippery and delicious!

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.200
Are you the one who made this tasty stuff?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.760
Your name's Senku-kun?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.990
What kind of girls do you like?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.770
A girl who can pump a ton 
of oxygen into the furnace.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.370
He's way too blunt.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.540
You never make small talk 
or anything, do you, Senku?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.040
Hey, Kinro, Ginro!

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.430
Just try this!

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.590
This ramen stuff is insane!

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.470
We will not consume that 
questionable sorcery food!

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.920
And for the guards to accept gifts 
of food is out of the question.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.140
Rules are rules.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.210
Yeah? Then what's that?

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.100
You won't take food, 
but you'll take a golden spear?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.870
Yeah, yeah!

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.440
Chief, your daughter is... 
Kohaku is feeding the villagers.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.530
What?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.530
Shall we go?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.790
What for?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.040
To eat.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.540
Why would I go?

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.140
Kohaku...

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.840
What are you doing with the outsider?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.050
Here you go!

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.180
I'm losing track of who I've served!

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.430
The response is amazing.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.430
Everyone's coming over.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.190
No problem.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.270
I'll just work them to death in 
proportion to however much they ate.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.200
You really do make sketchy faces.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.430
This is making me thirsty for a drink.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.580
Like, say, cola.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.330
Cola?

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.730
Senku, is he with you?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.840
No.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.690
Ramen!

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.250 line:20%
Ramen! Ramen! Ramen!

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.370
Come on, the noodles are going to get soggy.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.250
Kinro, Ginro, stop squabbling for a moment.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.180
What?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.050
What are—

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.470
I'll get to the point.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.970
Enemies.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.980
Answer truthfully, or I'll 
slit your throat here and now.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.980
Are you one of the long-haired 
man's underlings?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.690
Hey, I wouldn't mind being taken 
out by a cute girl like you,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.250
but I think you have me 
confused for someone else.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.760
I don't know anything 
about a long-haired man.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.870
I've been by myself ever 
since I was un-petrified.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.160
Good morning, world

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.370
Good Morning World!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.370
Good Morning World!

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.930
How far have I walked?

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.010
Only the pain in my feet

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.350
Gives me a sense of the distance

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.970
The hope for a beautiful view 
at the end of a long night

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.190
Is what keeps me going today

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.060
The mountains of the gods, 
the palaces of green

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.080
The depths of the caves, 
the ends of the deep blue sky

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.930
I'll go the full distance, 
there are no limits

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.260
To the ends of the world

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.810
Good morning, world

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.890
Good Morning World!

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.890
Good Morning World!

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.980
Rid away the impossibility of the dark

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.330
An odyssey turning mythology 
into the everyday

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:42.740
In this painstaking journey, 
turning over every stone

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.660
We'll expand our world

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.060
Let There Be the Light of Science

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.650
I thought I'd seen your face somewhere.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.990
You're Asagiri Gen.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.430
Are you acquainted?

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.740
No, not one bit.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.870
He's a magician who used to 
write trashy psychology books.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.870
Magic Psychology
Asagiri Gen

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.700
You've read my work?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.140
I'm so happy.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.460
Calling it "trashy" hurts, though.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.650
Call me a mentalist.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.500
Look, I'll apologize for taking the ramen,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.510
so would you please lower your weapons?

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.610
I'm so scared, my arms 
and legs are trembling.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.450
I might spill this delicious ramen.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.970
I-I'll hold on to it for you!

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.350
He's full of crap.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.880
I was out looking for food 
by myself when, surprise,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.360
the nostalgic scent of ramen 
hit me, and I wandered over.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.610
This man isn't the least bit terrified.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.370
And the words he weaves with his mouth 
carry as little weight as a feather.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.370 line:20%
Man, it's such a terrible lifestyle out there.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.220
Sure, whatever. I'll take your word for it.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.580
Either way, there's no such 
thing as a free lunch.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.540
Everyone who's had ramen has work to do.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.750
We upgraded the blowing function!

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.850
Iron mill furnace, level 2!

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.470
I think this'll work if we take turns!

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.150
Asagiri Gen.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.360
How are Taiju and Yuzuriha doing?

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.490
Oh, I see.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.050
You thought you could get me to 
fess up while I'm busting my ass.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.750
You have guts, pulling tricks 
like that on a mentalist.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.190
Don't worry, though.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.380
Taiju-chan's got an especially 
bottomless supply of strength.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.510
You know, don't you, Senku-chan?

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.160
He's definitely with the long-haired man.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.970
Should I kill him?

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.430
Hold it, idiot.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.460
Asagiri Gen.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.680
You ten billion percent knew 
I was trying to make you talk.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.890
Why did you suddenly decide to 
admit that you're with Tsukasa?

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.780
The tides have turned 
now that I've seen this.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.270
My job is to confirm that you're dead.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.180
"Tsukasa, Senku is alive."

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.220
With that, you would be done.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.050
That was the plan.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.620
But if you complete your iron weapons, 
there's no telling who will win.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.330
Finally!

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.550
Acquired iron!!

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.990
Here we go!

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.810
"I only found a primitive settlement.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.750
Senku is dead."

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.100
That simple false report would spare you.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.110
I'd really appreciate it if you would do that.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.100
I don't have any policy at all.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.850
I'm the world's most shallow man.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.490
If I can live happily with cute 
chicks, that's all I need.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:37.880
Whether you die or Tsukasa 
dies doesn't matter to me.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.500
I'm going to win, no matter 
who I have to dispose of.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:47.480
I can't decide if it'll be better for 
me if I let the kingdom of science

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.070
or the Tsukasa Empire win.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.800
That's all I have any interest in.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.820
On this side, there's plenty of sweet 
science stuff and ramen and all that,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.140
but the work is hellish.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.650
Meanwhile, Tsukasa-chan's empire has 
no science and the meals are simple,

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.580
but the work's easy.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:11.650
And if I revive idols and stuff, 
I'll be living the dream harem life.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.530
What's a harem?

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.110
Sorry, children don't need to know yet.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.550
I think ramen's better for sure.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.210
Ramen's nice, but not on hot days like this.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.000
At the end of the day, 
I'd side with Tsukasa-chan.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.790
Asagiri Gen, was it?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.650
Superficial, selfish men like 
you are best dead or imprisoned.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.260
So scary!

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.930
No, if we don't let him go back,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.220
Tsukasa will come here himself, 
and we'll be screwed.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.410
Relax.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.290
Once you see what we make 
with our beautiful new iron,

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.030
you'll ten billion percent want 
to join the kingdom of science.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.450
Oh? What's that?

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.030
Are you making swords or something?

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.250
A generator.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.580
A generator?!

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.060
Are you for real?!

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.960
That's totally not happening!

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.880
Hey, you have native copper.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.210
It's pretty. I don't want to break it.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.870
We'll melt it down to make copper wire.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.710
He's not even listening. Damn.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.890
Now, if only we'd get some lightning...

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.430
Anger of the heavens!

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.870
It's lightning!

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.400
If it hits you, you're dead!

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:40.020
Women and children, get inside!

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.410
Hurry, quick!

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.800
We actually got lightning.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.700
Well, it is thunderstorm season.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.080
We're way too lucky!

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.100
No, idiot! This is the worst case scenario!

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.590
We aren't prepared at all!

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.710
You aren't making a lightning 
generator, are you?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.700
There's no such thing.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.780
Of course.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.110
Magnets.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.470
I can make a generator if I have magnets.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.470
We have some of the iron sand that we got.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.060
The natural stuff isn't 
anywhere near strong enough.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.510
We're going to catch the 
lightning with an iron rod

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.970
and make a high-power magnet 
with the power of science.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.070
I was going to put up a stupid 
number of lightning rods,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.620
but we can't pass up this opportunity.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.450
We're going to get set up immediately.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.830
We're moving lightning fast, literally!

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.750
Melt the copper.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.340
Kohaku's shield is coated with lacquer.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.750
It's somewhere in the village!

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.710
I brought the lacquer!

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.990
Lacquer is a crazy good insulator.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.840
Coat the iron rod with it.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.470
What are you doing?

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.470
Wh-What are you doing with the bridge planks?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.730
I carved a channel in the plank.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.440
Pour the copper into the channel.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.690
Wrap the solidified copper 
all around the iron.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.690
Oh no, oh no! The foreigners 
are destroying the bridge!

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.560
So he's finally showing 
his true, evil colors.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.260
I bet they called down the anger of 
the heavens with their sorcery, too.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.090
Yeah!

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.800
Let me take care of it.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.590
I'll kill them.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.350
Shoot, it's Magma!

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.530
He's not one to listen to reason.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.180
We're going to have to fight them!

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.960
We're screwed if we go to war 
against the village right now.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.680
Damn it, what can we do?

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.820
I guess I don't have a choice.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.190
I'd rather not get killed in the fray.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.800
Can I have a bouquet of flowers, Suika-chan?

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.040
Flowers over war.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.340
Why the hell is this sly guy holding flowers?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.400
Yeah!

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.330
Were you the one who summoned 
the anger of the heavens?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.490
You have balls, coming to 
me to get yourself killed.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.690
Oh, no, no. It's the other way around.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:21.960
We're here to stop the 
lightning with our sorcery.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.090
Quit talking out of your ass.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.150
Like this.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.620
It actually disappeared right before our eyes!

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.830
That's enough to keep 
it out of Magma's sight?

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.490
It's a trick called the 
back palm or something.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.420
Magicians do it with cards and stuff.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.440
Not bad, you fraud magician.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.540
It's not impossible at all.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.820
An old guy named Wasilewski at NASA 
has already succeeded in an experiment

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.600
to make magnets using lightning.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.740
Wasilewski!

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.250
I happened to find this crazy 
rock on a bald mountain!

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.540
Chrome, this is the fruit of 
your ten years of exploration.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.760
That's right. Are you amazed or what?

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.310
We're here, at the bald mountain.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.660
It's the perfect spot for lightning.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.960
There's no better place.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.690
Set up the lightning rod, quick!

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.790
They're making a tower or something.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.110
I want to help—

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.110
Ginro!

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.780
You just want a silver spear, don't you?

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.620
Our job is to keep an eye on them.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:58.710
Rules are rules.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.270
The lightning's closing in.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.630
Crap, we don't have time 
to build a proper tower.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.430
But, damn it, we need to 
make it as tall as we can.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.220
If only there were something long 
we could shove into the ground...

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.060
N-No!

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.490
Anything but my spear!

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.440
So you <i>do</i> like it.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.740
My spear!

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.710
And so the god of lightning descends.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.340
What's up with you, Senku-chan?

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.250
There's nothing to work with 
in this stone-age world.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.940
Are you seriously going to...

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.330
Electricity, born with a bang.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.780
This is exhilarating.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.450
Yeah!

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.070
We got a magnet for the generator!

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.430
Jeez, the golden spear's in pieces.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.670
Sorry, but you'll have to forgive me, Kinro.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.660
It was an emergency.

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.220
I'm sure Senku will make you another one.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.400
Hey, where'd your spear go?

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.780
It's gone, eh?

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.980
The golden spear that you had made 
for you and never let me borrow.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.360
Huh?

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.280
Senku, we may have failed to make magnets.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.870
They won't go near each other, let alone stick!

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.170
They're being repelled 
by some mysterious force.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.910
You have the poles backwards.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.710
Acquired powerful magnets!!

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.710 line:20%
They're so strong!

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.090
Now we can make that crazy 
"electricity" thing, right?

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:22.100
Iron

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:22.100
Powerful Magnets

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.100
Copper

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.100
Phosphorus

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.100
Electricity

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.650
But Senku-chan, are you 
making a thermal generator?

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.270
Wind turbines?

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.050
Don't tell me you're making a nuclear reactor.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.330
Muscle-powered generator.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.950
Of course. I should have known.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.080
Whack the hell out of the copper 
sheet and file it down into a disk.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.770
Check it out!

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:59.060
I'm going to file it down with corundum, 
that tough rock I showed you before!

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.720
The second-strongest mineral after diamond.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.000
I like your collection, Chrome.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.290
I thought of coating the copper 
wire with phosphoric acid,

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.760
but lathering it in lacquer works, too.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.890
So, Senku-chan...

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:20.250
I've been wondering when 
I should bring this up...

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.280
What?

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.060
Why have you turned into Anpanman?

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.540
Lacquer rash.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:31.350
All right!

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.590
It's the kingdom of science's special...

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.870
dual-wield hand-crank generator.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.850
Acquired power generator!!

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.850
We have to spin the two 
disks at the same time?

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.470
That'll be pretty hard.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.530
We just need two people to do it together.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.090
We'll have to spin it in perfect 
timing, or it'll crumble to bits.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.770
If only there were two people

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.970
who worked in perfect sync
and had a lot of energy...

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.290
You lot again.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.660
What do you want this time?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.950
I'll show you our badass 
science machine! Come with us!

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.350
Why would I go?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.390
You're as stubborn as ever.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.850
What are you not satisfied with?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.550
He's obviously upset about his 
golden spear getting wrecked.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.640
Man, electricity is so amazing.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.260
In technological civilization,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.600
our world of sorcery, all sorts of 
contraptions work on electricity.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:42.160
With electricity, we might even be able 
to make and repair gold and silver spears.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.240
Right, Senku-chan?

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.560
Electrocoating isn't that easy.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.160
Do you even know the recipe?

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.900
I don't know a single thing.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.370
Asagiri Gen...

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.790
Your words really are as flimsy as a feather.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.070
You can count on the brothers to be 
perfectly in sync with each other.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.810
Now that we have Kinro and Ginro,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.940
the kingdom of science is 
really starting to shape up.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.920
Are they really making electricity?

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.610
This is a steam-roasted bamboo string.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.920
Do you need it to be a high spot?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.800
It doesn't matter.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.250
But, hey, we might as well.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.190
I see. It's an Edison light bulb 
made using Japanese bamboo.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.430
Edison light bulb?

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.020
Chrome, are you afraid of the night?

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.830
Yeah, it is dark, after all.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.770
Why do you ask?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.030
There's no darkness in my age.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.430
Old Edison erased night from the world 
with his incandescent light bulb.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.030
He conquered the twenty-four-hour day.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.120
With science, humanity defeated the night.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.470
This is going to light the darkness

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.730
of the night for the first time in 3,700 years.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.570
It's the flame of science.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.600
Maybe I don't know what to do　　

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.090
Hurry up, my mind is on the moon　　

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.910
Flying up to where the wind blew

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.840
In my hands awakens

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.280
The passion overflowing

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.790
Just wandering through this world

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.920
Your one shining pure

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.800
Could never be pierced 
with a rusty knife

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.520
I'm burning like a fire gone wild

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.990
The moment an arrow 
shot through my heart

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.610
The noise plaguing me was released

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.940
Everything was different 
from that moment on

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.000
If I don't try, I'll never know

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.570
Why do flowers bloom?

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.940
Your voice echoes

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.070
Tell me why?

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.160
I just shouted to the sky　　

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.870
But you are no no no longer here, 
that's right?

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.420
The life we confirmed that day

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.210
You can call it a fleeting 
dream if you want

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.970
But I'll save you from a wounded today

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040
Next Episode

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.040
A Flimsy Alliance
