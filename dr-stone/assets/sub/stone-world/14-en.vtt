00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm grateful for the science, Suika, Senku.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.080
Let me teach you, Magma...

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.530
Had science helped me conquer my eyes,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.680
I would have surpassed 
your strength long ago.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.560
Damn, Kinro!

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.930
He's giving <i>the</i> Magma a run for his money!

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.520
Magma-sama!

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.020
You're awesome, Kinro!

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.670
But it's not too convincing when 
you say it with that mask on.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.260
Yay!

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.190
Magma's all worn out!

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.750
Kinro's going to win it!

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.660
We've already won, then!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.370
Now we can give Ruri the cure-all!

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.850
Is that watermelon mask your sorcery?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.340
Isn't that against the rules?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.510
You're right.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.390
Even though it comes late, 
we'll have to confirm the rules.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.700
I can't move anymore.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.360
I can hardly even speak.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.050
The match is over.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.300
Ask Jasper, the referee.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.670
If he agrees, I'll accept my loss.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.110
I can't hear what they're talking about, 
but Magma's turned into a clean Magma.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.250
Referee, this mask was clearly thrown into 
the match by Suika in order to help me.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980
Knowing that, I still wore it.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.890
If I've broken the rules, then I've lost.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.090
The rules are the rules.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.410
Damn it, you could just keep your 
mouth shut if it's going to hurt you.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.510
That's Kinro for you. He's so straight-laced.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.980
You didn't throw it at him or anything.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.110
The mask is just an article of clothing.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.980
Therefore, it's not a—

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.590
I knew you'd go and ask!

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.090
You're as proper as hell, after all, Kinro!

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.670
Winner: Magma.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.430
Damn, that dirty bastard!

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.090
Kinro!

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.480
Kinro! Kinro!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.820
Sorry.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.140
Thank goodness you're alive!

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.150
Well, whatever.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.350
This is a team battle.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.120
As long as someone beats Magma, we win.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.040
That match should have dealt 
plenty of damage to him.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.020
That's what matters the most.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.660
Round two: Chrome, Mantle.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.210
Forward!

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.710
Oh, I'm up.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.250
I'm more worried about the next match.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.930
Match 1

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.680
Match 2

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.680
Match 3

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.680
Match 4

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.360 line:20%
If Kohaku isn't back by the end of 
match two, she'll be disqualified.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.680 line:20%
Yeah, I know.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.830
Where's Kohaku-chan?

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.040
Where did Kohaku-chan go?

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.670
She ran off earlier to save you.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.280
What?!

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.690
I'm going to go find her!

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.650
Sit still. You don't have your glasses.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.210
It's too late either way.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.670
All we can do is wait.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.570
I have to buy as much time as I can.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.770
After seeing Kinro and 
Magma fight for the top...

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.790
It's like watching two kids fight.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.810
Hang in there, both of you!

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.570
Chrome, huh?

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.020
He's not going to be a match for me.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.770
Even if he makes it to the top 
with me, he won't last a second.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.870
Kohaku!

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.380
Mantle!

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.590
Lose!

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.200
Right now!

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.960
Yeah!

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.710
Pay attention, man!

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.130
Mercy!

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.880
Winner: Chrome!

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.380
Shit.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.640
The third match...

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.560
Due to Kohaku's absence, the winner is Senku.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.050
She didn't make it back in time!

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.490
Senku!

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.490
Kohaku-chan!

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.900
Damn it!

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.040
You barely missed it!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.450
I'm sorry!

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.910
Mantle caught me!

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.930
Thank goodness!

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.470
I'm so glad he was lying.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.700
All that matters is that you didn't drown.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.710
This is my fault.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.170
I'm sorry.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.270
You lost because of me, Kohaku-chan.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.460
There's nothing we can do about that.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.110
Besides, it isn't your fault in the slightest.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.150
Doesn't that basically settle it?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.410
The priestess's husband, the new chief, is...

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.570
It's Magma!

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.410
Be glad, Ruri.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.010
From now on, you're my woman.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.740
Now that we've lost our last stand in Kohaku,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.970
the only real fighting 
chance we have left is...

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.930
Ginro the guard. You're all we've got.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.550
Ginro the guard...

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.220
Does Ginro have any shot against Magma?

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.860
To be honest, it'll be tough.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.450
You said it yourself, Senku...

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.680
We're gaming the hell out of this Grand Bout.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.120
The strongest isn't necessarily going to win.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.250
Haven't you been wondering what I've 
had in my mouth this whole time?

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.840
Don't tell me...

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.930
Isn't that the raw ingredients 
for Senku's science drink?

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.280
You've kept that in your cheeks 
like a squirrel this whole time?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.140
I've been saving it for just before my match.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.440
Ginro, Argo, forward.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.110
I happen to know how powerful

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.320
Senku's science power is from when 
we went to get sulfuric acid.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.570
Senku's special power-up drink...

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.830
I bet it's even more effective if it's raw!

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.110
Raw?!

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.450
You're just going to end up with the runs!

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.620
Shh. He's better off not knowing 
anything at this point.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.710
Here we go! Here we go!

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.540
Here we go!

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.180
  Note:    Ginro's self-image

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.060
Here we go... Here we go...

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.890
That man sure is impressionable.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:05.350
Not that I didn't know that...

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.060
For better or worse.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.300
There's so much gaming going 
on in this Grand Bout.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.820
Simpletons like him tend to break 
through in situations like these.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.490
Match four, begin!

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.450
This kid is nuts!

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.300
He's going straight at him.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.790
Ginro's on fire!

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.250
He's under the impression that he's gotten 
stronger just by eating the herbs?

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.950
He's never had caffeine before.
He's probably completely wired.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.040
And his gullibility makes him fearless.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.930
Not a thing wrong with that.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:57.360
That does nothing to me.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.670
What I have that you don't

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.120
  Note:    Ginro's self-image

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.120
is the mind to trust in science!

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.840
Holy crap, Ginro!

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.940
Oh, damn!

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.130
Reality

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.830
Holy crap, Ginro...

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.090
Oh, damn...

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.300
Damn it!

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.250
Why won't you go down?

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.770
Winner: Ginro!

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.090
Where are you going, Ginro?!

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.570
He probably has the runs.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.890
Not surprising after how much he ate.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.010
He's all beat up and withered out.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.050
Not good...

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.930
I don't think he'll be fighting any more.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.460
I'm sure you know what the situation is.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.850
If we let Magma make it to the 
final match, it's game over.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.250
The probability of Ginro,

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:19.360
who's all beat up, or you 
defeating Magma is zero.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:25.240
So the only way to save Ruri 
is for me to defeat Magma.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.450
Magma, Chrome, forward!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.560
If you can take down Magma,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:43.260
you'll be the new village chief 
and Ruri's husband, Chrome.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:00.320
There's no way Chrome can beat 
Magma if they go head-to-head.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.150
But this is a team battle.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:06.740
All we can do is hope that Kinro's 
done enough damage to him.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.280
Chrome's been practicing hard 
against the target, too.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.580
I'm sure the gods of battle are watching.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.350
Semi-final: Magma versus Chrome.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.590
Begin!

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.300
Wh-What's going on? 
How's Chrome doing against Magma?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:43.430
So awful...

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.790
We all knew how it was going to end.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.240
He's toying with him on purpose.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.080
You have to surrender!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.260
Chrome's going to die!

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.970
Oh, dear.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.850
This doesn't look too good, Chrome-chan.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:17.540
Chrome, I know you have no intention 
of throwing the match for Ruri.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.690
I'm surprised you get it, Magma...

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.200
You meat-for-brains.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.240
This just gets me even more excited.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.010
Until Ruri cries and begs 
for surrender in your place,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.000
I'll beat you into a pulp and 
make sure you never walk again.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.730
Chrome...

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.760
Special attack: Blinding!

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.140
"Special attack," my ass!

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.220
You piece of shit!

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.860
That's right.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.390
I never stood a chance 
against Magma to begin with.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.260
That's right.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.100
I'm Chrome.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.060
Science user Chrome!

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.720
What is he doing with Suika's mask?

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.280
Oh, look at that. It's the 
sorcery mask that I bashed up.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.870
Do you think you can 
scare me with that now?

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:43.610
Clear sky.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.040
I'm starting a fire with sunlight and a lens.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.910
I have to bet everything on that one move.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.950
He's got the wrong idea.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:04.210
Chrome's trying to use Suika's lens to 
start a fire on Magma's black clothes.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.960
That's clearly his intention.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.450
The magnifying glass I used

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.730
to start a fire is convex, 
which means it focuses light.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.860
Meanwhile, glasses are 
concave. They spread light.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.100
What does that mean?

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.850
Suika's glasses aren't going to 
start a fire, ten billion percent.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.480
I'm going to save Ruri.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.990
I'm going to win and turn this 
village into a kingdom of science,

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.290
with the lens Senku made... and my tenacity!

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.320
I like it!

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.000
Show me what you've got, you lanky brat!

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.490
No, Chrome!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.880
You can't start a fire with a concave lens!

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.460
Don't worry, Senku-sensei.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.350
I'm a bit of a science user myself!

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.600
Damn it, hold your arm completely still.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.380
Keep your nerves calm!

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.860
Chrome, don't tell me... No way...

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:18.080
He was dripping water on the 
convex lens of Suika's mask.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:25.530
He made a concave lens, 
literally out of sweat and tears.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.170
Is that actually going 
to start a fire, though?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.310
Yeah, it's called a burning lens.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.520
There's even been a case where a lens

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.760
made from a suction cup 
and air started a fire—

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.740
Asagiri Gen!

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.310
The smooth talker! Why are you here?

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.480
Long time.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.210
Look, never mind what I've been up to.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.730
Shouldn't you be worried 
about Chrome-chan?

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.790
I need the kingdom of science to win.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.200
I need that bottle of cola, y'know.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.800
You've been watching the 
whole time, haven't you?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.890
How many seconds does he 
need to start the fire?

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.290
That's the big question.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.980
It turns out the math isn't that simple.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.050
I'll figure it out right now.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.940
The lens has a diameter of five centimeters.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.800
The solar constant is 1362 
watts per square meter...

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.810
Damn it, calculating the heat 
transfer rate mentally isn't easy.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.900
2.6821...

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.320
Rounded to 2.68.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.240
Assuming a radiation rate 
of zero in calm winds,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.340
fur's condition for ignition 
is close to that of paper.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.550
With a specific heat of 1.3 kilojoules,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.550
a density of 900 kilograms per cubic meter,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.290
an ignition point of 300 degrees Celsius...

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.460
Sixty seconds.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.460
On the dot.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.340
Okay.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.930
Now it's up to the mentalist.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.180
Come on, bring it.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.310
Hurry it up, or I'll kill you.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.440
Magma-chan!

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.280
Thanks for killing me the other day.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:16.060
You!

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.780
You're the sorcerer from outside!

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.950
H-H-How are you alive?!

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.770
With sorcery, of course.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.360
I just put a curse on you 
so that your heart

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.300
will explode as soon as you 
so much as take a step.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.620
His heart will explode?!

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.620
So he'll die in seconds?

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.110
This is obviously outside 
interference by sorcery!

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.580
This is cheating!

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.270
It would be if your heart exploded.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.600
But if it's a bluff, then it's just a taunt.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.230
Nothing wrong with that.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.110
Why don't you try moving?

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.690
See if you explode.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.580
So dirty...

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.780
So dirty...

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:11.630
Chrome-chan, take him 
down while he can't move.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.540
O-Oh, no!

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.470
I'm so terrified, I can't move anymore.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.810
Wh-Wh-What horrible acting, Chrome!

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:27.970
It's good enough.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.350
Gen made it convincing.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.530
Please, I'm begging you!

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.590
Hurry!

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.130
This sorcery is seriously draining.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.110
I can only hold him for a minute.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.660
Good thing you're a wimp.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:49.880
All I have to do is wait for the 
sorcerer to run out of strength.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.500
Not bad, mentalist.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.890
Kinro-chan's done quite 
a bit of damage to Magma.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.150
He kept whacking at Chrome-chan 
with nothing left.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.790
I get it.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.510 line:20%
I want a break... I'm so tired...

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.740
You actually want to take a break.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.570
And I've given you a beautiful 
excuse to do that.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.770
You're best off waiting for 
the sorcery to wear off.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.410
People will buy any cheap lie 
if it'll justify being lazy.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.780
You've already fallen for 
my magic, Magma-chan.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:21.450
What's the matter?

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:22.580
Go already, Chrome!

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.110
Hurry up!

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.110
Get him!

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.220
Gen bought 60 seconds.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.440
It's up to you now, Chrome.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.650
Sixty seconds is under ideal conditions.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.460
Even just the rippling of the water on 
the lens can throw off the calculation.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.030
Crap...

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.210
There's no way to keep the tip 
of the spear perfectly still.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.350
Calm your mind.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.020
Thank you, Chrome.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.730
I'm going to save Ruri.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.820
Senku's science, Gen's magic, my tenacity...

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:14.390
With our strengths combined, 
the light will set a fire.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.500
Pat it.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.880
What is this?

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.990
It's a surface flash fire.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.800
The flame spreads instantly across 
the surface of fluffy clothing.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.310
Hey, Magma, relax.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.230
I have no intention of becoming a murderer.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.560
I'll do you the kindness of helping you.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.460
Winner: Chrome!

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.870
Yeah!

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.100
Magma's down!

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.960
Which means the last contestants are...

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.090
Senku, Chrome, and Ginro-chan.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:08.850
Chrome!

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.700
They're all on our side!

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.470
Yeah.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.140
It's total victory for 
the kingdom of science!

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:58.910
The Culmination of Two Million Years

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.960
Next Time

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.960
The Culmination of Two Million Years

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.960
