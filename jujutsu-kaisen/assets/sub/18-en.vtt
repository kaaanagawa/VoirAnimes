<i>Blood traces on the arrowhead.</i>

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:51.760
<i>So Kamo's cursed technique
defies the laws of physics?</i>

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.890
You can summon another shikigami
at the same time, right?

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.727
It doesn't feel nice
to know you're holding back.

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:04.230
<i>Divine Dog is busy at work.</i>

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.484
Likewise.
You're left with one arrow, right?

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.445
I won't save you
even if you collapse from anemia.

<i>Blood Manipulation.</i>

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.576 line:20%
<i>It can control one's own blood
and objects attached to it.</i>

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.538 line:20%
<i>A fitting cursed technique
from one of the Great Families.</i>

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.166
Don't worry.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.878
I've prepared these in advance.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.172 line:20%
<i>Ten Shadows Technique.</i>

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:32.550 line:20%
<i>A cursed technique
passed down in the Zenin Family.</i>

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.595 line:20%
<i>One can summon ten shikigami
using shadows as a medium.</i>

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.224 line:20%
<i>If only Maki and Mai inherited it…</i>

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.446
<i>Was he this strong?</i>

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.450
I didn't expect you to react to it.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.203
Don't let down your guard.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.671
<i>My cursed energy defense was late.</i>

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.216
<i>His speed and strength
are completely different from before.</i>

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.428
<i>Blood Manipulation is not just about</i>

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:19.681
<i>manipulating shapes or movement.</i>

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.809
<i>It can even control body temperature,</i>

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:27.147
<i>pulse rate,
and the number of red blood cells freely.</i>

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.608
Flowing Red Scale.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.027
Doping?

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.571
Great observation.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:37.740
But please refrain from using that word.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:18.424 line:20%
<i>My katana</i>

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:22.178
<i>Was taken away</i>

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.683
<i>I wonder where Mai's sister is.</i>

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.893
<i>She's fast.</i>

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:34.691
<i>Well, it's true that I won't be able
to fight without my katana.</i>

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:38.194
<i>Is bubble tea really that good?</i>

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.241
It's Mechamaru.

00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.121
Hello. I'm Miwa, the useless one.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.539
<i>Sleep.</i>

ULTIMATE MECHAMARU

KYOTO SISTER-SCHOOL GOODWILL EVENT
KASUMI MIWA WITHDRAWS

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.886
KASUMI MIWA

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.311
Return.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.453
She fell asleep.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:30.872
I'll head over.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:31.789
What?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.044
I can't leave her in the forest
with Cursed Spirits, right?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.009
What is this?

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:47.221
A Semi-Grade 1 Cursed Spirit
that will be released in the zone.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.058
Not a Grade 2 Cursed Spirit?

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.102
A Grade 2 isn't assuring enough.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.145
What?

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:58.191
Our own people are disorganized.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:02.195
This is the scent and whistle
used to control it.

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:07.200
If possible, use it and kill Itadori.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:10.286
It might get eliminated before I use it.

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:12.580 line:20%
Don't worry.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:16.751 line:20%
It's trained to not take action
before you sound the whistle.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.838
<i>Kamo is good.</i>

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.924
<i>He must have smeared the scent on Itadori</i>

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:26.636
<i>when the video feed was disrupted.</i>

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:31.390
<i>Once he mixes it in his blood,
then it will be easy.</i>

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:37.188
<i>If Itadori is fighting Todo,
he won't get away with just a scratch.</i>

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:42.860
<i>If the Semi-Grade 1 Cursed Spirit
attacks him after that…</i>

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:45.196
<i>He would be dead for sure.</i>

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.323
That's right.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:51.285
I'm worried about Miwa too.
Hurry up and go.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.419
Kelp.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.792
Salmon, salmon roe, spiced cod roe.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.506
All right.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.051
We should get to work too.

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.804
Let's make a clothing rack.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.724
Satoru Gojo's at least 190cm tall, right?

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:57.727
He'll make a good clothing rack.

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:09.447
Why does everyone bully you, Mother?

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:13.117
<i>Because I'm an illegitimate mistress.</i>

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.454
Then why take special care of me?

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.707
Why bring me here pretending
that I'm the eldest son?

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.877
<i>Because his wife
couldn't give birth to a son</i>

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.630
<i>capable of inheriting
his cursed technique.</i>

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.759
Then as the next head of the Kamo Family…

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:06.128
It's rare to find a shikigami user
who's flexible in close combat.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.797
You've improved.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.340
I'm happy for you.

00:09:09.924 --> 00:09:13.344
Why are you acting familiar with me
from time to time?

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.846
It's sympathy.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.600
You'll be the pillar supporting
the Great Families in the future.

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:25.648
I'm going to kill Yuji Itadori.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.860
Is that Principal Gakuganji's order?

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:33.531
No, it's my own will.

00:09:33.614 --> 00:09:36.450
As a member of the Kamo Family,

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:38.953
I think this is the right decision.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:44.166
<i>I must act and behave like
the eldest son of the Kamo Family.</i>

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.460
<i>It's for Mother's sake.</i>

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.006
You should understand it too.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.217
Because we're the same.

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.511
No way.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.972
<i>He's saying some scary stuff suddenly.</i>

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.891
It's true.

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.852
No, it's not.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.479
Tell that to Maki.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.401 line:20%
I'm no longer connected
to the Zenin Family.

00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:15.239
Besides, I don't think I'm right.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.658
No, sorry.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.368
It's wrong.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:23.748
It doesn't matter
whether I'm right or not.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.502
I only believe in my own conscience.

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.715
<i>Helping others
according to my own conscience.</i>

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.803
<i>If someone denies me of that…</i>

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.684
All that's left is to curse that person.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.938
<i>A Shikigami?</i>

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.650
<i>There was one left?</i>

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.154
<i>It was about to run out,
and he used it as bait?</i>

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.243
This one consumes a lot of cursed energy
and can only be used alone.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.788
I just purified it recently.

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:06.040
Max Elephant.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:16.967
<i>That's a huge target.</i>

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.052
<i>I must act first!</i>

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.015
<i>Water?</i>

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.104
<i>I'm swept away
by the water and its pressure!</i>

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.563
<i>It's dangerous in a wide area.</i>

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.107
<i>He'll use that trick.</i>

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:36.612
Nue.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:49.291
I'll only hinder you if I'm around.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.043
<i>I…</i>

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.462
Blood Manipulation!

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:58.884
Crimson Binding!

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:04.974 line:20%
I'm not going to lose!

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:08.811
-What?
-What?

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.730
What's that?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:14.733
Inumaki!

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.486
Run away now!

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:27.580
What?

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:28.581
What?

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.374
What…

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:33.711
Has the game ended?

00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:35.671
And they are all red flames…

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:40.259
That's weird.
The crows didn't see anything.

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.180
I wish I could say
that they were exorcised by

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.849
the Great Teacher Gojo's students…

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:50.853
An unregistered cursed energy
ignites a red flame as well.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:55.191
Outsiders? You mean intruders?

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:58.903
Has Master Tengen's barrier failed?

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:01.864
Intruders or not,

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.867
this is still an emergency.

00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:09.622
<i>Being able to eliminate that
means the opponent's quite strong.</i>

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.957
<i>Who could it be?</i>

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.419
I'll go see Master Tengen.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.590
Satoru, protect Principal Gakuganji
and the students.

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:23.344
Mei Mei, stay here and locate the students

00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:26.472
and then report it to Satoru
and the others.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.307
Understood.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.601
I look forward to the bonus.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.729
Come on, Grandpa!

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.606
It's time for a walk.

00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:37.942
You've eaten lunch just now, right?

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.237
Let's hurry.

00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.542
What?

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:02.716
What?

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.803
What a big fuss.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:11.892
However, when Cursed Spirits die,
nothing else remains.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:17.273
Nothing can be made out of it.

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:22.278
Will this do?

00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:24.905
Right, and that too.

00:14:26.365 --> 00:14:30.035
"Emerge from darkness,
that which is darker than black."

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.872
"Purify this impurity."

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.502
All right!

00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:43.257
I look forward to the clothing rack.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.238
A Veil? Why is it appearing now?

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:09.408
Gojo!

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.494
Go in first before the Veil fully forms!

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:15.080
-No, I can't do that.
-What?

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.917
Actually, the Veil
has been formed completely.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:21.921
It seems to prioritize effects
over visual.

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:23.547
They are good.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.222
Well, since it has been set up,

00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:33.974
I just need to tear it apart.

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:43.275
<i>What's this strange feeling?</i>

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.902
Wait a minute.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:49.907
Why were you pushed back, but not me?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.455
I see.

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:01.001
Utahime and Grandpa.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.378
This Veil…

00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:06.131
is made specifically
to keep Satoru Gojo out

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:09.718
while letting other sorcerers
enter and leave.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:11.387
What?

00:16:12.179 --> 00:16:15.224
<i>He's right. That makes sense.</i>

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:19.728
<i>But for someone to set up
a specific barrier like this means that…</i>

00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:22.856
They are highly-skilled Curse Users.

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:26.986
Not only that, but he also has a fair
amount of information on Jujutsu High.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.780
Come on. Hurry up and go.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.282
We don't know about their objective,

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.910
but it's our loss if someone dies.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.046
<i>What a strong curse aura!</i>

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.757
<i>Don't tell me
a Special Grade Curse Spirit is here.</i>

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.343
Hey.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:54.346
Hey!

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.808
Satoru Gojo isn't here!

00:16:58.642 --> 00:17:00.102
<i>A Curse User?</i>

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.229
<i>He's not the master of this aura,</i>

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:04.815
<i>but he's quite strong.</i>

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:08.819
How dare that stupid monk lie to me.

00:17:08.902 --> 00:17:11.613
Utahime, you may continue on first.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:16.201
Prioritize the students' safety
and try to avoid a fight.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:22.124
Wait a minute.
Let me kill that woman at least!

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:26.462
I can't make anything with an old man's
brittle bones and wrinkled skin!

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.466
Whether I have brittle bones or not…

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.637
You can confirm it by killing me!

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:40.559
Come back after
drinking your milk, old man.

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.155
Why would a Cursed Spirit be in school?

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.782
Who cast this Veil?

00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:58.285
Probably a Curse User
who cooperates with Cursed Spirits.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:01.663
You know something?

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.626
These are unregistered
Special Grade Curses.

00:18:05.709 --> 00:18:08.754
It seems like
they are cooperating with humans.

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:13.634 line:20%
I think it might be the Special Grade
Cursed Spirit that attacked Mr. Gojo.

00:18:14.134 --> 00:18:16.261
<i>Even its appearance fits the report.</i>

00:18:17.304 --> 00:18:19.556
I can tell even with his drawing.

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:23.393
You're right.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.646
Let's contact Mr. Gojo.

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:27.564
Wait a minute.

00:18:28.232 --> 00:18:31.443
You can understand him?

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.612
That's not important right now.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.657
The opponent might know
how to use a Domain.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.451
We have to stay away and retreat--

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:44.665
Stop!

00:18:49.336 --> 00:18:51.171
Blood Manipulation…

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:52.548
Slicing Exorcism!

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.678
<i>It's not effective at all?</i>

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.065
<i>Its skin is really tough!</i>

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:13.193
<i>That katana…</i>

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.488
<i>Where was he hiding it?</i>

00:19:20.784 --> 00:19:23.745 line:20%
Stop it, foolish children.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:27.332
<i>What's this?</i>

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:31.044
<i>It's speaking in a foreign language,
but I can understand it.</i>

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.422
<i>This feels gross.</i>

00:19:34.047 --> 00:19:38.177
I merely wish to protect this planet.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.388
Don't listen to its nonsense.

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:44.933
It's not the same as those
low-level Cursed Spirits.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.395
The forest, ocean, and sky…

00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.148
They cry out in pain,
saying they can't bear it anymore.

00:19:51.815 --> 00:19:55.444
They can no longer coexist with humans.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:20:00.741
They know that some humans
are kind to this planet,

00:20:00.824 --> 00:20:04.411
but how much can that kindness
make up for?

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.457
<i>It has its own language system.</i>

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.961
All they want is time.

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:15.797
Ask Inumaki to retreat.

00:20:17.257 --> 00:20:22.221
If there's enough time,
this planet can shine again.

00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.233
A time without humans.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.570
Die, and become a sage.

00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:13.373
<i>-Juju Stroll.
-Juju Stroll.</i>

00:22:17.085 --> 00:22:19.379
Hey, Jogo!

00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:22.674
You burned Hanami's flower bed again!

00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.760
Hanami is crying.

00:22:31.099 --> 00:22:32.517
Hanami.

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:36.146
Why don't we just kill Jogo?

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:42.235
My boyfriend's senior
is in <i>that </i>line of business.

00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:45.238
No, it's not that serious.

00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:13.350
Is this…

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:14.935
slash-and-burn farming?

00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:19.731
Was it because the old soil
had insufficient nutrients?

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.373
My heart is touched.
