WEBVTT

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:07.924
We still have time before
our appointment with the principal.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:09.634
Do you want to take a short detour?

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:12.846
No, I should be early once in a while.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.934 line:20%
Stop the car.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.853 line:20%
What? Right here?

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.397
-You can go first.
-What?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.774
Is this some kind of test?

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.193
Are you going to beat me up if I leave?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:28.945
Who do you think I am?

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.572
Okay, I'll leave then.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.457
Well then…

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.092 line:20%
Who are you?

00:01:16.868 --> 00:01:20.622
What a shame. He was nothing much.

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:21.706
What?

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.171
Who's…

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.091
nothing much?

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.929
Darn brat.

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:40.141
<i>It's a Cursed Spirit
but it can communicate well.</i>

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.812
<i>On top of that, this cursed energy…</i>

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.648
<i>It's an unregistered
Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.860 line:20%
<i>It's probably stronger
than Sukuna's current strength.</i>

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.157
Special Grade is called so
because it's special.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.744
Even I would be in a fix
if you just came at me like that.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.249
Is your pride hurt?

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.625
No.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.628
I'm starting to have fun.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.683 line:20%
You're starting to have fun, huh?

00:03:45.767 --> 00:03:49.187 line:20%
You have no sense of crisis.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.649
<i>He purposely attacked
when no one's around.</i>

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.859
<i>No.</i>

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.780 line:20%
<i>It's to prevent other sorcerers
from coming to help.</i>

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.907
Ember Insects!

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:05.370
But if you're targeting me…

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.580
You're right about having
no sense of crisis.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.463
What will happen if this hits me?

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:20.927
<i>The sounds…</i>

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.144
A two-stage attack using sound
and explosion.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.938
That's clever of you.

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:40.697
It's not over yet!

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.038
Is that all?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.583
To put it bluntly,
you're overly acclaimed by the weak.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.004
Humans nowadays are really fake.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:05:01.467
They live in falsehood,
the ugliness of it makes me sick!

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:07.265
Let your death prove
the real strength and truth.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.475
-Didn't you…
-What?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.394
…said that just now?

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.895
Why don't you learn?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:13.896
All the ashes…

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.860
What's going on?

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.194
Well…

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:22.822
In short, you missed.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.908
Impossible.
It's different from the one before.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.286
I did touch and kill you.

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:33.291
What you touched was
the Infinity between you and me.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:34.459
What?

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:35.793
Let me show you.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:37.795
Give me your hand.

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:41.299
Come on.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.802
Come on.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:49.307 line:20%
<i>There's no intention to kill.
I guess I'll test him out.</i>

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:57.899
You see?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:02.945
<i>I can't touch him.
My hand stopped in between.</i>

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.865
<i>Is this Infinity?</i>

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.159
You didn't really stop.

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.870
Instead, your movements got slower
as you got closer to me.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.331
What do you think?

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:17.293
I can shake hands with you like this.

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.796
I refuse!

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.798
Don't be shy.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.759
I'll be embarrassed too.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.720 line:20%
Damn you!

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:33.893
<i>He's quick.</i>

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:37.021 line:20%
<i>His blows are not just reinforced
with cursed energy.</i>

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:40.983
<i>Why? I don't understand,
but I've got to figure it out!</i>

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:42.819
It's not over yet!

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:51.494
Infinity is everywhere.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.915
It's just that I brought it
into reality with sorcery.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.835
Convergence. Divergence.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:01.754
What do you think happens
if you touch this void?

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:04.298
Cursed Technique Reversal…

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.008
Red.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:53.431
Oh, it's just right.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:57.602
<i>I can give it to you.</i>

00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.147
But you'll die, Jogo.

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.365
<i>I guess that wasn't a lie.</i>

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:18.414
<i>But since I can't hit him,
I'll just drag him to the domain.</i>

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:21.959
<i>Where is he?</i>

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.378
Sorry.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:25.296
What?

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.214 line:20%
Where am I?

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.924 line:20%
Hey! Where am I?

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.218
-What?
-Did you wait long?

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.928 line:20%
That guy is…

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:33.638 line:20%
<i>Sukuna's vessel.</i>

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:36.432
This is Yuji Itadori,
and he's here to observe.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.683
It's Mount Fuji!

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.185
His head looks like Mount Fuji!

00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:49.403
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:51.364
<i>I won't leave you!</i>

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:53.658
<i>Sam…</i>

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.790
<i>What?</i>

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.376
<i>He learns surprisingly fast.</i>

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.545
<i>-Let's go.</i>
-Yuji.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.173
Mr. Gojo!

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.176
<i>There's no problem talking to him either.</i>

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.719
What's the matter?

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:17.640
<i>Seems like I can increase the output
and proceed to the next stage.</i>

00:09:17.723 --> 00:09:19.475
We're going out, Yuji.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.393
What?

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.270 line:20%
Time for an extracurricular lesson.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:26.023 line:20%
I'll teach you the apex of sorcery battle,

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:28.192
Domain Expansion.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.825
Why won't we sink?

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:40.454
I was still in school ten seconds ago,
right, Mr. Gojo?

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:41.622
What's happening?

00:09:41.706 --> 00:09:43.082
Oh, we flew here.

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:45.585
<i>-He doesn't intend to explain.
-He's Sukuna's vessel.</i>

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.087 line:20%
<i>So you're alive.</i>

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:51.841
<i>We must ensure that Satoru Gojo
is unable to fight.</i>

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:57.096
<i>You have to make Ryomen Sukuna
and Yuji Itadori your ally.</i>

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.184
<i>For future considerations,
I can't kill Itadori.</i>

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.396
<i>Did he find out about our goal?</i>

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.357
Who's that kid? Your shield?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:13.237
A shield? No.
I told you he's here to observe.

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.365
I'm teaching this kid.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.493
Well, don't mind him. Just fight with me.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:24.874
It's stupid of you
to bring yourself a burden.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.960
It should be fine.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.295
Because…

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:31.213
you're weak.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.554
Don't look down on me, brat!

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:42.725 line:20%
I'm going to swallow
your smiling face altogether!

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.441
<i>He said this guy…</i>

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.568
<i>is weak?</i>

00:10:54.362 --> 00:11:00.242
<i>He's even more terrifying
than the monsters I've seen so far!</i>

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:06.332
It will be fine.

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.668
Stay close to me.

00:11:12.588 --> 00:11:14.632
Domain Expansion.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.356
What?

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:42.660
What is this?

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:46.122
Coffin of the Iron Mountain.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.589
What is this?

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.300
This is a Domain Expansion.

00:11:59.635 --> 00:12:02.930
-A domain built with cursed energy…
-It's hot!

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.558
-…and enforced with sorcery.
-It's hot!

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.895
<i>What you guys experienced
in the juvenile detention center</i>

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.524 line:20%
<i>is an unfinished domain
without sorcery enforcement.</i>

00:12:14.024 --> 00:12:17.194
<i>If it was a proper domain,
all the freshmen would have been dead.</i>

00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:19.697
<i>I believe Megumi knew that.</i>

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:25.035
Domain Expansions uses
a lot of cursed energy.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.329
But it has its advantages as well.

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.958
Firstly, the status under
environmental factors is increased.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:35.212
Oh, so it's like buffs in video games.

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:37.173
Secondly…

00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:43.387
<i>Ordinary Jujutsu Sorcerers
would have burned to ashes</i>

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:46.432
<i>the moment they entered my domain.</i>

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:50.269
The sorcery technique
granted to them in the domain

00:12:50.352 --> 00:12:52.146
will definitely hit.

00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:53.397
Definitely?

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:55.357
Definitely!

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:58.694
<i>Don't worry,
there are some countermeasures.</i>

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:03.699
<i>You can fight it with sorcery,
like what I just did.</i>

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.911
<i>I don't recommend the other method,</i>

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:09.538
<i>which is to escape the domain.</i>

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.831
<i>Normally, it's impossible.</i>

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:12.249
Also…

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:16.420
If I neutralize your Infinity
with a more concentrated domain,

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.547
my sorcery should probably hit you, right?

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.299
Yes, it will hit.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:21.300
What? Infinity?

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:24.220
Hand me the Prison Realm.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.097 line:20%
I'm adding it to my collection.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:31.727
<i>I came here half for fun.</i>

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:36.482
<i>I thought it wouldn't matter
if I couldn't kill him.</i>

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.985
<i>However, he showed me the difference
in power between the two of us.</i>

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:44.406
<i>As a Cursed Spirit and a new human,</i>

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.992
<i>I can't accept this!</i>

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.871
The most effective way
to fight against the domain

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.666
is to use Domain Expansion ourselves, too.

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:56.502
When both parties use Domain Expansion,

00:13:57.086 --> 00:14:00.506
the more refined sorcery
will gain the advantage.

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:04.510
Although it also depends on
the compatibility and cursed energy level.

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:10.266
Not even your ashes will be left,
Satoru Gojo!

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.065
Domain Expansion.

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.028
Unlimited Void.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.346
<i>What happened?</i>

00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:53.392
<i>Was my domain defeated?</i>

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:57.730
<i>I can't see nor feel anything.</i>

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.149
<i>No.</i>

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.819
<i>I can see and feel everything.</i>

00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.156
<i>All kinds of information are endless.</i>

00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:11.452
<i>Therefore, I can't do anything.</i>

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.998
This is the inside of limitless.

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.168
Perception and communication…

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:24.381
They force you to perform
countless actions called "survival."

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.343
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:15:27.843 --> 00:15:31.388 line:20%
You're given everything
but nothing can be done.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.891 line:20%
-You can only die slowly.
-What?

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.311
But I still have something to ask you.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:40.731
So I'll stop here.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.164
Well then…

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.668
Who sent you here?

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.963
<i>This is the best Jujutsu Sorcerer?</i>

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:05.673
<i>Even as living creatures…</i>

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:08.550
<i>He's on a different level than me!</i>

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:12.638
Oh, man.

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:14.932
What will you do?

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.767
Will you save him?

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:22.147
I can't be seen by anyone in the school.

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.274
I'll go back first.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:29.196
If you want to save him, just go.

00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:33.575
Although I don't know
if you possess such emotions.

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:42.042
How dare you.

00:16:42.126 --> 00:16:44.044
You're just a mere Cursed Spirit.

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:48.132
Maybe it came by its own will.

00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:53.762 line:20%
What's the point of killing me?

00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:57.016
Anyway, who's the opponent?

00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:59.977
Hey, tell me.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.981 line:20%
Who would tell you, you darn brat?

00:17:04.064 --> 00:17:07.776
Is it really okay for you to say that?

00:17:08.485 --> 00:17:09.987
You bastard…

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.073
Say it or I'll exorcise you.

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.992
Although I still will after you confess.

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:18.537
I didn't know Cursed Spirits could talk.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.581
It's so natural that I didn't realize it.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.009
-Flowers.
-It's so pretty.

00:17:34.094 --> 00:17:36.096
<i>This is sorcery, right?</i>

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.723
<i>It will reduce my fighting spirit.</i>

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.817
I'm okay! Go chase that guy!

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.154
Sorry, I lied! Help!

00:17:57.785 --> 00:17:58.952
What?

00:17:59.536 --> 00:18:02.915
<i>They escaped.
It's good in concealing its aura.</i>

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.294
<i>This one is creepier
than that volcano head.</i>

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:12.257
I'm really sorry about that…

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:15.094
Cursed Spirits of this caliber
are teaming up?

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:17.763
-This is getting exciting.
-…but you brought me here.

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:18.722
Yuji…

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:19.681
No.

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:23.519
I hope everyone gets strong enough
to deal with Cursed Spirits of that level.

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:26.105
To deal with that?

00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:29.108
It's better to have
a specific goal in mind, right?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.944
Man, I'm glad I brought you along!

00:18:32.027 --> 00:18:34.738
<i>I seriously have no idea what's going on.</i>

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:36.115
<i>Is this guy for real?</i>

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:40.619
Once the goal is set,
all you need to do is to achieve it.

00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.454
Let's speed up our schedule.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:47.126
For the next month, you'll be watching
a movie while fighting with me.

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.585
A fight with you?

00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:52.631
Will I still be alive one month later?

00:18:52.714 --> 00:18:54.800
After that,
you'll participate in real battles.

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.469
I'll let you complete a few big missions.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.972
Basics and applications.

00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:03.600
After you've mastered it,
let's show off at the exchange program!

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.018
Question, Mr. Gojo!

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.562
Yes, Yuji?

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:09.565
What's this exchange program?

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.816
What?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.693
<i>Didn't I tell you?</i>

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.286
He's late!

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.524
It's so peaceful.

00:19:56.737 --> 00:19:59.198
How's Jogo, Geto?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.366
On the brink of death.

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:05.662
Hanami went to save him,
so I think he should be fine.

00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:09.416
You're really irresponsible.
You instigated it, right?

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:12.961
Of course not. I tried to stop him.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.592
Speak of the devil.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.094
Jogo, Hanami.

00:20:21.178 --> 00:20:23.847
I'm glad you guys are safe.

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:26.850 line:20%
How do I look safe?

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.103
Be glad that this is all you got.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.399
You…

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.568
You should understand now.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:40.113 line:20%
<i>Satoru Gojo needs to be
at the right time and place.</i>

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:44.284 line:20%
<i>Seal him under the premise that we have
established corresponding advantages.</i>

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:47.996
It will be executed in Shibuya
on 31st October.

00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:50.332
I'll inform you of the details later.

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:53.252
Is that okay, Mahito?

00:20:53.335 --> 00:20:54.211
THE CLOUD GIANT

00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:57.214
No objections.

00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.174
Just act cunningly.

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:01.176
Like a curse,

00:21:01.802 --> 00:21:03.303 line:20%
and like a human.

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.398
JUJU STROLL

00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:41.985
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:43.320
What are you guys doing?

00:22:43.403 --> 00:22:44.446
Brazilian gymnastics.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.989
-Three, four.
-Three, four.

00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:47.783
I think we're done with the warm-ups.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.825
You're right.

00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:50.952
What?

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:54.664
What are you guys planning to do?

00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:55.665
What?

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:04.674
Geto!

00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:13.517
Mahito!

00:23:17.938 --> 00:23:20.357
Overhead…

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:33.954
These guys…

00:23:34.037 --> 00:23:35.789
I'll kill them later!
