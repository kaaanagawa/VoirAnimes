WEBVTT

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.010
Kugisaki, don't touch his blood.

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:12.929
I know--

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.434
Run.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:19.352
Run with your back against me.

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.818
Kugisaki, can you run faster?

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:27.902
I can't!

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:36.536
I'll have your back.

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.496
Thanks a lot.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.791
What?

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.343
<i>What terrifying speed.
He was carrying a person, too.</i>

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.432
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.059
<i>They are going to escape.</i>

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:00.351
<i>Forget it.</i>

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.034
Good. We're out of range, right?

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.621
Well done. You have my praise.

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:21.039
Whatever you say.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.041
Just kidding. Thank you.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.334
What?

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.884
<i>Did he take the shortest route
to ambush us?</i>

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.677
Itadori--

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.976
Kugisaki!

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.354
Don't worry.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.316
My brother's blood
has different properties than mine.

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:54.781
Even my blood is not lethal
unless you get it all over your body.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:58.118
But it's going to hurt like hell.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:02.288
Our cursed technique
is only about to begin.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.040
Rot Technique…

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.042
Decay.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.299
<i>What…</i>

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.685 line:20%
Membranes, wounds…

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.064 line:20%
If you're hit with our blood

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.984 line:20%
and one of us uses the cursed technique,

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:58.529
that part of your body
will start to decompose.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.200
That boy can last for 15 minutes at most.

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.453
And you, perhaps ten minutes?

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.249
You two will turn
into skeletons by morning.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.834
<i>If this is a cursed technique,</i>

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.128
<i>all I have to do is to undo it.</i>

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.130 line:20%
So it's really poison?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:19.008
Poison is the end result.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.137
After all, our cursed technique
is only decomposition.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.723
<i>My explanation
of the cursed technique is over.</i>

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.643
<i>They will die faster than my prediction.</i>

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.729
Now what will you do?

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.150
<i>Brother, these people are nothing special.</i>

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.987
<i>In the Meiji Era,</i>

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.448
<i>there was a girl who bore a child
born of Cursed Spirit and human.</i>

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.951
<i>Due to her unexplained pregnancy,</i>

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:47.745
<i>she was ostracized by her family.</i>

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.956
<i>She fled to a temple
run by a Jujutsu Sorcerer</i>

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.084
<i>with her baby's corpse in her arms.</i>

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:57.672
<i>But at that very moment,
she ran out of luck.</i>

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:59.841
<i>Noritoshi Kamo.</i>

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.010
<i>Knowledgeable about curses and Jujutsu,</i>

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.345
<i>he is known
as the evilest sorcerer in history,</i>

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.222
<i>and the disgrace of the Great Families.</i>

00:05:06.306 --> 00:05:08.141
<i>His immense curiosity</i>

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:11.477
<i>made him obsessed with children
born of both Cursed Spirit and human.</i>

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.897
<i>Nine pregnancies, nine abortions.</i>

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.444
<i>How did the process go?
What happened to those women?</i>

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.654
<i>All these records were erased.</i>

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.700
<i>Cursed Womb: Death Paintings 1 to 3.</i>

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.369
<i>They are classified
as Special Grade Cursed Relics.</i>

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.165
<i>Do their cursed energy originate
from their mother's grudge?</i>

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.207
<i>Or…</i>

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.585
<i>I don't remember anything about my mother.</i>

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.713
<i>I also have born no hatred</i>

00:05:38.796 --> 00:05:41.924
<i>towards humans or Jujutsu Sorcerers.</i>

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.343
<i>For 150 years,</i>

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.098
<i>we relied on each other
to endure the seal placed on us.</i>

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.350
We'll side with the Cursed Spirits.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.436
Will it be okay?

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.855
He looks quite suspicious, Choso.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.816
The future painted by this Cursed Spirit

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.360
is more beneficial to us.

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:03.905
That's all.

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.324
Don't be grateful to them
for our incarnation.

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:08.367
Brothers, listen carefully.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:10.870
Eso lives for Kechizu,

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.372
Kechizu lives for me,

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:15.875
and I live for Eso.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:20.379
<i>The three of us are one entity.</i>

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:22.256
<i>For my brothers,</i>

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.092
<i>if this is their wish,</i>

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.136
<i>then I'm willing to sacrifice my life.</i>

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.308
If this is too painful,
I can relieve your agony now.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:33.643
What?

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:38.147
So you win once your cursed technique
lands on your mark.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:39.899
But what a shame.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.569
That's a bad match against me!

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:45.404
<i>Straw Doll Technique…</i>

00:06:46.364 --> 00:06:47.406
<i>Resonance!</i>

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.371
Let's have a game of endurance, shall we?

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:55.873
You guys don't like pain, right?

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.877
Then start crying
and undo the cursed technique!

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.132
<i>A curse used to counter techniques?</i>

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:06.092 line:20%
<i>A game of endurance?</i>

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:09.971 line:20%
<i>If we don't undo it,
this situation will continue?</i>

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.057
<i>Straw Doll Technique: Resonance.</i>

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:18.771 line:20%
<i>It applies cursed energy to inflict damage</i>

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:21.732
<i>to an opponent's targeted body part.</i>

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.027 line:20%
<i>The effective range is wide,
and the ability difference</i>

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.988
<i>between the user and the target</i>

00:07:27.071 --> 00:07:29.991
<i>as well as the targeted body part
affects skill potency.</i>

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:34.829
<i>In Straw Doll Technique,
the value of blood isn't high.</i>

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.622
<i>However,</i>

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.584
<i>Resonance activates
on a connection to the target.</i>

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:44.005
<i>Now their blood and mine are tied together</i>

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:48.009
<i>thanks to the Rot Technique
they used on me.</i>

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.888 line:20%
<i>Luckily, it's also effective
on the younger brother.</i>

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.973 line:20%
<i>I'm going to die in the end anyway.</i>

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:57.477
<i>It's better to go on the offensive!</i>

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.563
<i>Although it is quite powerful,</i>

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:04.150
<i>it's still not enough to kill us
no matter how often she activates it.</i>

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:07.945
<i>As long as we endure,
you will be the first one to die.</i>

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:09.489
<i>When Decay is activated,</i>

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:14.160
<i>the pain from the Rot Technique
will make it difficult for you to move--</i>

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.500
<i>Why is he moving freely?</i>

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.837
Resonance.

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:34.722
<i>Itadori is the vessel of Ryomen Sukuna,
the King of Deadly Poisons.</i>

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.142
<i>Thus, he is immune to all kinds of poison.</i>

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:41.312
<i>Poison is the end result.</i>

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:45.816
<i>After all, our cursed technique
is only decomposition.</i>

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.194
<i>Although there is pain
caused by decomposition,</i>

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:50.821
<i>the end result of poison
is ineffective against him.</i>

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.990
<i>But mere pain…</i>

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.913
<i>will not stop…</i>

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:03.000
<i>Yuji Itadori!</i>

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:09.924 line:20%
Kechizu!

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:12.677
You're so noisy!

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.054 line:20%
-Resonance!
-What?

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.850
<i>They switched positions?</i>

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.269
<i>Is he making a dying woman</i>

00:09:21.352 --> 00:09:23.938
<i>attack my younger brother,
who's dying faster?</i>

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:26.315
<i>Do you think you can stop
my actions at any time?</i>

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.986 line:20%
Hey, you woman!

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.280
<i>Should I undo my cursed technique?</i>

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:34.699
<i>I can't save my brother if this continues.</i>

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.785
<i>If I activate Decay,
I can't use Wing King.</i>

00:09:37.868 --> 00:09:42.707
<i>But does that woman have enough energy
to kill my brother now?</i>

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.751
<i>Even if she gets in the way,</i>

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:50.548
<i>I won't get killed by this guy
before she dies.</i>

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:54.510 line:20%
<i>I will never undo the cursed technique!</i>

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.346
Eso…

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:01.350
<i>The three of us are one entity.</i>

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.239 line:20%
<i>I undid
the cursed technique instinctively.</i>

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:20.369
Wing King!

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.997
<i>What was that black light just now?</i>

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:07.792
<i>I'm sure that</i>

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:11.379
<i>I used my arm to block his fist
that was covered in cursed energy.</i>

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:15.716
<i>But before I knew it,
my entire arm was cut off.</i>

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.968 line:20%
Kechizu…

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.471
Don't die, Kechizu.

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:24.892
Eso!

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:32.233
I think I haven't shown you this trick.

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.322
Hairpin.

00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:45.162
Don't worry.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.083
I'll send your brother
to accompany you right away.

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.169
Kechizu…

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:57.007
<i>The three of us are one entity.</i>

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:00.052
I'm sorry, Choso.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.304
I was right by his side, and yet…

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.766 line:20%
<i>Why didn't he disappear?</i>

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.309 line:20%
<i>Is he still alive?</i>

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:08.477 line:20%
<i>No!</i>

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:11.480
<i>He's not a Cursed Spirit!
He has a physical body.</i>

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.278
It's dangerous!

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.946 line:20%
For god's sake.

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:20.823
What?

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.367
Mr. Sawamura!

00:12:23.451 --> 00:12:25.619
-Drive faster.
-What?

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:29.123
I'll kill you both
if you step on the brakes.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.083
Do you understand?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.219
Don't chase after me, Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:47.683
<i>I'll kill them both when I recover.
Especially that woman.</i>

00:12:47.766 --> 00:12:49.643
<i>I'm sorry, Kechizu.</i>

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.187
<i>I can't even grieve over you.</i>

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.398
<i>But I will take revenge.</i>

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.027 line:20%
What is that woman doing?

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.528
Kugisaki!

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:04.992
Don't rush me!

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.161
Straw Doll Technique…

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.289
Resonance!

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.510
<i>After using Black Flash,</i>

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:27.515
<i>a sorcerer will enter the zone,
similar to what athletes experience.</i>

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.728
Darn it!

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:36.023
<i>That wasn't just a counter technique?</i>

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.819
I'm sorry.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.508
It hurts.

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:09.014
Geto, stock.

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.850
-What's wrong, Choso?
-Hurry up.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.813 line:20%
Hey! Don't smash the chess piece!

00:14:15.896 --> 00:14:17.982 line:20%
My brothers died.

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.067
So you can sense this kind of thing?

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.986
What happened?

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:24.530
I can understand
if it's a fully fleshed Cursed Spirit,

00:14:24.613 --> 00:14:28.158
but I don't think they could be defeated
by a curse that swallowed one finger.

00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.703
-Wait a minute.
-I can't find one.

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.872
Why did you break it, anyway?

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.791
I got the report.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.335
Eso and Kechizu were killed by

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.254
Jujutsu High first-years,

00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:43.507 line:20%
<i>Yuji Itadori and his classmate.</i>

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:51.265
SUGINAMI 385
64-355

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:57.187
<i>The number you dialed
cannot be reached at the moment…</i>

00:14:57.271 --> 00:14:59.064
They still won't pick up!

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:01.442
<i>Where did those brats go?</i>

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:06.447
Kugisaki, are you okay?

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.741
Yes, I guess so.

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.784 line:20%
But it may leave scars.

00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:14.204
Is that old man okay? He just drove away.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:17.249
As for the poison…

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.543 line:20%
When we get back,
will Ms. Shoko still be awake?

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.003
Will she even be sober?

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.465 line:20%
Why are you fidgeting? It's gross.

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:27.384
I wonder if this is your first time

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.304
killing someone
instead of exorcising them.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.972
What about you?

00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:33.807
I did it once.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:38.270 line:20%
No, that would be misleading.
I killed three people.

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.440
You are doing much worse than me.

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.027
Frankly speaking, I don't feel anything.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.488 line:20%
This is normal
for a Jujutsu Sorcerer, right?

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.491 line:20%
Not to quote Fushiguro,

00:15:50.574 --> 00:15:53.744 line:20%
but there are only
so many people we can save.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.915
My opinion is, well…

00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:02.670
People who are not involved in my life
should not affect how I do things.

00:16:03.587 --> 00:16:04.672 line:20%
Am I cold?

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:10.302 line:20%
But there are also people like you
doing whatever they want.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.806
I'm not trying to comfort you,

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:17.101 line:20%
but we had no time to check if
they were Cursed Spirits or Curse Users.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.061 line:20%
Even if the opponent is a human,

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.314 line:20%
we're not capable of trapping
opponents of that level for long.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:23.691 line:20%
You know it, don't you?

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:29.029 line:20%
But he cried when his brother
died in front of him.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:31.657
I see.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:36.453
I'm so glad that you and I survived.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.788
I feel so relieved.

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:44.169
Even so, someone cried over a life I took.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:46.380
That's all.

00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:49.216
<i>I see.</i>

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:52.720
<i>Then that makes us accomplices.</i>

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.307
-Fushiguro?
-Fushiguro?

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.020
Hey. You guys are back.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.688
I'm glad you're all right.

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.690
That gave us a fright!

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.442
We thought you were dead.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:07.818
We're so relieved!

00:17:08.402 --> 00:17:10.112
Please lower down your voices.

00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:11.822 line:20%
My head hurts.

00:17:12.406 --> 00:17:14.700
Don't fall asleep with Sukuna's finger.

00:17:14.783 --> 00:17:15.826
It's too dangerous.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.704
How did you know about the finger?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:20.831
Do you have the energy to hear me out?

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:24.293
No. Anyway, contact Ms. Nitta first.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:27.838 line:20%
It must be sealed immediately
or Cursed Spirits will gather.

00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.923 line:20%
Shall I eat them instead?

00:17:30.007 --> 00:17:31.925
They are not leftovers.

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:34.636
We don't know
how many more fingers you can eat.

00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:36.346
Don't eat it.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.349
But take it
since you seem the least worn out.

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:41.852
Let me remind you again. Don't eat it.

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:45.355
<i>He talks to me like I'm a dog.</i>

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:50.277
What?

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.657 line:20%
We told you not to eat it!

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:56.992
Why is it my fault?

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.786
This guy is too much.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.789
He's not helpful at all this time.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:04.875
<i>The Sukuna in you
will tell us where they are</i>

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.336
<i>since he wants to regain his powers.</i>

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:10.631
Don't tell me Mr. Gojo spouts nonsense?

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:12.091
You just realized that?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.927
Hey, you guys!

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.471
-What have you guys been up to?
-Ms. Nitta.

00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:19.473
-She's mad.
-You didn't pick up the phone.

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:21.350 line:20%
Explain it to me!

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.812 line:20%
-Can't you contact me?
-All right, let's go back.

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:26.688
-Report, contact, discuss!
-I'm hungry.

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:29.108
-Are you listening?
-Is there a Rippa Sushi nearby?

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.318
-Answer me!
-Rippa Sushi in Shinkansen is good.

00:18:31.401 --> 00:18:32.361
You're so annoying.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.740
<i>Man! It wasn't just
a Cursed Spirit with a finger.</i>

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.867
<i>I was shocked
after investigating the remains!</i>

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:42.204
It turned out to be a vessel
of the Cursed Relic!

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.916
They defeated opponents equivalent
to a Special Grade.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.210
The first-years got it big.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:52.005
Is my coaching ability too good?

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.467
I don't want to waste my holiday
talking to you.

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:57.511
You want to ask about the party, right?

00:18:57.594 --> 00:18:59.221
<i>So did you find it?</i>

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.639
Not at all.

00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:02.891
Everyone's too busy, including me.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:05.644
Well? Should I ask the students?

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:09.231
<i>I can't drink,
so nonalcoholic drinks are fine with me.</i>

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:12.025
Please continue to search for it.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:16.196
UTAHIME IORI

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:20.576
<i>After all, I don't know
if anyone's eavesdropping on her.</i>

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:22.619
<i>I don't want to think about</i>

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:24.663
<i>the possibility of a student
being the mole.</i>

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:27.166
It's so annoying.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.170
Well then, I leave the rest to you, Mei.

00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:38.135 line:20%
SATORU GOJO, 10 MILLION YEN

CASH CARD ATM

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:43.140
<i>Don't tell Itadori
about the fingers resonating.</i>

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:45.601
Are you sure about that?

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.852
I'm quite sure.

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:48.145
The case is closed.

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:53.525 line:20%
Probably only Ms. Nitta and us
would notice this.

00:19:54.735 --> 00:19:58.447 line:20%
<i>Itadori only became
Sukuna's vessel by chance.</i>

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:07.164 line:20%
In the first place,
he swallowed the finger to save me.

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.667 line:20%
But he won't be happy
with that explanation.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:12.669
So don't tell him.

00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:14.588
I won't tell him.

00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:16.256
As a lady, I'm considerate.

00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:18.675
This is all your fault!

00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:20.928 line:20%
Because you ate me,

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:24.973
my scattered soul is awakened.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.685
Do you want to save
as many people as possible?

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:29.895 line:20%
Brat!

00:20:29.978 --> 00:20:32.898 line:20%
Those people die because of you!

00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:35.442 line:20%
Hey, don't tell Fushiguro about this.

00:20:36.151 --> 00:20:40.239
What if the person you saved
takes someone else's life later?

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:43.242
Don't you dare.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:56.838
Leaf mustard.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.967
What's wrong? Your movements seem dull.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.093
Did you become weak?

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:02.594
Shut up!

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:05.097
My body's just weak after resting.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:09.184
Speaking of which, have you heard
about the first-year students?

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:10.102
Yes.

00:21:10.185 --> 00:21:13.605
They exorcised
three Special Grade equivalents, right?

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:14.856
Salmon.

00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.193
Well then…

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.488
We can't lose to them.

00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.991
-Salted fish roe!
-Yes!

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:26.034 line:20%
What?

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:29.830
Was that your full strength?

00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:31.999
If it wasn't, then it's not training!

00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:32.916
Kelp.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.423
<i>Special Grades are anomalies

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:43.802 line:20%
I believe that Grade 1 Sorcerers
uphold the standards

00:21:43.885 --> 00:21:48.432 line:20%
of the strongest sorcerers,
and are suitable leaders of our society.

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:51.727
The level of danger,
confidentiality, and involvement…

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.438
It is incomparable below Semi-Grade 1.

00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:57.441 line:20%
And yet, what did you say just now?

00:21:57.524 --> 00:21:59.943
Maki Zenin, Panda…

00:22:00.027 --> 00:22:02.946
Megumi Fushiguro, Nobara Kugisaki,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.950
and my brother, Yuji Itadori,

00:22:07.034 --> 00:22:09.453
in the name of Aoi Todo…

00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:11.955
<i>And in the name of Mei Mei…</i>

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:15.000
<i>…we recommend them
to be promoted to Grade 1 Sorcerers.</i>

00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:25.010
Don't you think you bought too much?

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:26.762
Half of it belongs to you.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.181
My things are in this single bag!

00:22:29.264 --> 00:22:30.432
Oh, god!

00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.477
What?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.729
If you dare drop any of those bags,

00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:37.481
I will kill you.

00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:39.399
Yes, madam.

00:22:39.483 --> 00:22:40.484
What?

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:50.535
I told you,
I would kill you if you dropped any of it!

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:52.704
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.957
-You should take at least one bag.
-How will you pay me if it breaks?

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:57.459
I'm Fushiguro.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:00.170
Yes, okay.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.923
I got it. I'll hang up now.

00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.258
What's wrong?

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:08.220
Mr. Gojo wants to see us.

00:23:08.303 --> 00:23:10.097
What? Why?

00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:11.848
It's a new mission.

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:13.517
And a confidential one to boot.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:14.601
What?

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:16.978
We just finished up one.

00:23:17.062 --> 00:23:18.021
Isn't this fine?

00:23:18.605 --> 00:23:21.316
Mr. Gojo just said that
it's a confidential mission.

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:22.901 line:20%
It must be interesting.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:24.903
He says that often.

00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:26.905 line:20%
He always talks about it.

00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:29.783
Oh, well!

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:32.953
Let's go.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.794 line:20%
