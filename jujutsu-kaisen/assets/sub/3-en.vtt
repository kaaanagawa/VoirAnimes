00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.713
Satoru, take him to the dorm.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:08.091
Also, explain the various
security measures to him.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.217
What?

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:11.970
You've passed.

00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.180
Welcome to Jujutsu High School.

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:16.808
Fushiguro!

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.852
You definitely look much better this time.

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:21.146
There are plenty of empty rooms.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:23.565
Isn't it better
when the place is more lively?

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:26.484
-I think it's good--
-Just classes and missions are sufficient.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.527
What a pain…

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.363
Oh, wow! Your room looks really tidy!

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.992
-Like I said, you're a bother!
-Oh, god!

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.244
But isn't this fine?

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.455
Anyway, we're going out tomorrow!

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:42.041
We'll be meeting
the third first-year student.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:51.718
<i>The Shibuya-Shinagawa train
will be arriving on Platform 1 soon.</i>

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.306
<i>For your own safety,
please stand behind the yellow line.</i>

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.308
<i>Saori…</i>

00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.187
<i>I'm here.</i>

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.943
<i>I'm in Tokyo.</i>

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.823
There are only three first-year students.
Isn't that too few?

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:18.453
Well, have you ever seen a man
who could see a curse before?

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.954
Well…

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.955
No.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.459 line:20%
And that's why
there are very few Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.295
By the way,
I thought I was the third student.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:30.465
I heard that her school transfer
was decided way back.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:32.967
<i>It's a special school after all.</i>

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.386
<i>She must have had a reason.</i>

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.224
Sorry to keep you waiting! What?

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.768
So your school uniform came in time.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.645
Yes, it fits me perfectly!

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:45.939
But it looks
slightly different from Fushiguro's.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:47.774
It even has a hood.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.069
The uniform can be altered upon request.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:51.986
What?

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.614
I didn't ask for that.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:57.742
That's because
I made a custom request for you.

00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.119
I see.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.079
Oh, well, it's fine.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.624
Be careful. This is Mr. Gojo's habit.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.002
By the way,
why are we meeting in Harajuku?

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.088
<i>She said she wanted to meet here.</i>

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.507
<i>I want popcorn!</i>

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:15.677
Hello. Are you working now?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.428
No, I'm not.

00:02:17.512 --> 00:02:20.098
I'm looking for a model.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.016
That's my job.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.768
Are you interested in becoming one?

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:25.311
I'm in a hurry.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.480
Let's just have a talk!

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.192
Hey, you.

00:02:31.276 --> 00:02:32.569
What about me?

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:34.863
<i>"What about me?"</i>

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.617
I'm asking about the modeling job.
What do you think about me?

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:42.370
Oh, you know, I'm in a hurry.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.667
What the heck?
Don't run away. Make it clear!

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.713
-Are we going to talk to <i>that </i>now?
-Excuse me, please forgive me!

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:53.631
I'm getting a little embarrassed.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:55.884
The same goes for you too.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.844
Hey, over here!

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.930
Oh, my! What's with
the guy with the blindfold?

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.227
Let's do the introduction again.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.771
My name is Nobara Kugisaki.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:11.900
Cheer up, boys. Here comes a girl.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:47.912
Stare…

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.124 line:20%
The name's Yuji Itadori. I'm from Sendai.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:52.667 line:20%
I'm Megumi Fushiguro.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.296
<i>How crude.</i>

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.257
<i>He's definitely that kid
who used to eat his own boogers.</i>

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.342
<i>Judging by his name, he sounds like</i>

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.095
<i>someone full of himself.
I can't deal with boys like him.</i>

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.890
<i>He's the kind that will ignite a fire
on oil-drenched seagulls.</i>

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.684
Man.

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.603
I've got a real mess on my hands.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.315
She's sighing after seeing our faces.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.108
Are we headed somewhere after this?

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.070
It's rare for the three
first-year students to gather.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.115
And two of them just came to Tokyo.

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.533 line:20%
Of course, we're going to…

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:27.118 line:20%
do some sightseeing in Tokyo.

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:30.288 line:20%
-Tokyo!
-Tokyo!

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.373
-We love Tokyo!
-What?

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.417
I want to go to Tokyo Disneyland!

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.377
You dumbass! Tokyo Disneyland's in Chiba!

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.089
-Let's go to Chinatown, Mr. Gojo.
-Chinatown is in Yokohama!

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:44.052
Isn't Yokohama in Tokyo?
Don't you know? Look at the map!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.388 line:20%
-What? Don't be ridiculous.
-Allow me to announce the destination.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.391
<i>It's Roppongi!</i>

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.894
-Roppongi.
-Roppongi.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.231
There's a curse here, isn't there?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.275
-You liar!
-You liar!

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:00.735
This is Roppongi, right?

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.528
How dare you mock countryside folks!

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.323
<i>There's a big cemetery nearby.</i>

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:09.035
<i>Add dilapidated buildings to the mix,
and curses start to appear.</i>

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.746
Isn't it easier for them
to appear in cemeteries?

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.540
The problem is not the cemetery.

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:18.920
It's the heart of those
who think the cemetery is terrible.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:21.547
Oh, just like that time in school.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.550
Wait, this guy doesn't even know that?

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:26.010
Actually…

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.557
He ate the Special Grade Cursed Relic?

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.726
It's so disgusting!

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.144
How unhygienic!

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.562
No way!

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:37.772
What did you say?

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:38.815
I agree with that.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:41.442
I want to know everyone's skill level.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:44.070
This will serve as a practical test.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:48.116
Nobara and Yuji.
Get rid of the curse in this building.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.117
What?

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:53.329 line:20%
What? Didn't you say that
a curse can only be exorcised by a curse?

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.581
I don't know how to cast a curse.

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.835
You're already half a curse.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.087
You have cursed energy in your body.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.091
However, you can't
just control curses easily.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.509
So use this instead.

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:10.638
This is a Cursed Tool
known as Slaughter Demon.

00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:12.390
It's a weapon with cursed energy.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.892
It works on curses too.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:16.561
How lame!

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.732
-Oh, also…
-What?

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.110
You can't release Sukuna.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.614
<i>Letting him out
will get rid of the curse immediately,</i>

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:31.200
but it will implicate
the humans nearby as well.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.703
Got it. I won't let him out.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:36.789
Hurry up!

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:37.832
Okay.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.041
Have a safe trip.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.889
Should I follow them?

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:56.184
Don't force it, you just recovered.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.478
<i>But I think we need
to keep an eye on Itadori.</i>

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.104
<i>True.</i>

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:04.567
-<i>But it's Nobara we're testing this time.</i>
-What?

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.110
It's depressing.

00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:09.572
Why are we still fighting curses in Tokyo?

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:10.490
What?

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.533
Aren't you here to get rid of curses?

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.035
This is a waste of time.

00:08:14.118 --> 00:08:15.453
Let's split up.

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:18.206
I'll start from the top
and work my way down.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:19.540
You start from the bottom.

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:22.543
Let's finish this up quick
and head to Ginza for sushi.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:25.546
Wait a minute. Let's be serious.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.632
Curses are dangerous.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.930
I don't want a newbie
to comment on my work!

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.306
Just hurry up and go!

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:40.102
I don't get your attitude at all!

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.063
That's why you're not popular with girls!

00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:45.024
How did you know that?

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.527
Are you so popular that you can say that?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.778
Darn it!

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.531 line:20%
What?

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:02.875
Here is your receipt…

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:06.087
<i>A curse has appeared.</i>

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:28.734
All right.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.112
I can move well.

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:36.325
Yuji's quite the crazy person.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.868
<i>Even if they look horrendous,</i>

00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.204
<i>or if they take after human forms,</i>

00:09:40.288 --> 00:09:42.915
<i>as long as they're trying to kill him,</i>

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.459
<i>he will destroy it without hesitation.</i>

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:51.382
Unlike you, he wasn't exposed to curses
at a young age.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:55.386
He's a boy who lived
a normal high school life.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:00.099
<i>Even with talent,
there are Jujutsu Sorcerers</i>

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.311
<i>unable to conquer their fear
and disgust of destroying these monsters.</i>

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.354
I'm sure you've seen
your fair share, right?

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:10.943
<i>I want to confirm her insanity today.</i>

00:10:12.486 --> 00:10:14.697
Hey, that curse over there.

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.788
I'm talking to you,
the dummy in the middle.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.957
Do you think you can hide from me?

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.379
If you don't come over, I'll destroy you.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.424
But Kugisaki is experienced, right?

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.092
How will this help?

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:38.304
A curse is born from people's hearts.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:42.266
<i>It also grows stronger
in proportion to our population.</i>

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.778
Okay.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:03.079
<i>Can Nobara understand this?</i>

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:09.585
<i>The curse level between
the countryside and Tokyo is different.</i>

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:13.422
KUGISAKI RESIDENCE

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.513
<i>A curse is born from people's hearts.</i>

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:21.430
GO BACK TO TOKYO

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:25.017
<i>It also grows stronger
in proportion to our population.</i>

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:30.356
<i>The curse level between
the countryside and Tokyo is different.</i>

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:40.616
I suggest you take those out.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.707
Since my curse flows into them.

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.633
<i>All done.</i>

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.230
<i>There's a child.</i>

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:15.443
<i>He probably sneaked in here to play
and got caught by the curse.</i>

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.948
Come on, it's fine now.

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:22.950
Come out.

00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:25.911
What?

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:34.044
So it's true that kids
won't go near pretty girls.

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.254
I'll call Itadori.

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:36.338
Wait!

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.341 line:20%
Don't leave me.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:59.987
<i>Is it using him as a hostage?</i>

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.158
<i>This curse has intelligence.</i>

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:05.743
<i>Even if there are levels,</i>

00:13:05.826 --> 00:13:08.454
<i>they are not based
solely on their curse level.</i>

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:09.371
What?

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:10.539
"Deviousness."

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:14.960
Beasts with intelligence
may occasionally set a cruel scale.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:19.215
<i>With life on a scale, that is.</i>

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.175 line:20%
Darn it.

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:23.177
Darn it!

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.430
<i>This curse is nothing to me.</i>

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.099
<i>It's a Grade 4. Or even a Grade 3.</i>

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:30.392
<i>The lowest of the lowest!</i>

00:13:31.727 --> 00:13:37.358
<i>It knows that,
and that's why it's taking hostages.</i>

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.402
<i>I need to calm down.</i>

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:44.865
<i>If I die, that child will die too.</i>

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.494
<i>Even if the child dies first, I won't die.</i>

00:13:50.412 --> 00:13:52.248
<i>Think reasonably.</i>

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:54.792
<i>Even if it's just me…</i>

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:57.461
<i>I guess it's worth it
to save a life, right?</i>

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.218
I'm unarmed.

00:14:04.843 --> 00:14:06.512
Let him go.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.520
<i>I'm such an idiot.</i>

00:14:15.062 --> 00:14:17.773
<i>See? It's not letting him go.</i>

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:25.698
I wanted to meet Saori for the last time.

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:31.787
Wait, I missed?

00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:46.343
Are you okay?

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.720
Yes.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:51.765
It's running away!

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:54.518
I'm not letting you run!
Itadori, give that hand to me!

00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:55.436
What?

00:14:57.521 --> 00:14:58.397
What?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.024
-I'll exorcise it.
-Don't panic.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.360
A voodoo doll?

00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:04.445
It's too dark.

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:09.658 line:20%
Straw Doll Technique…

00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:12.745
<i>Resonance!</i>

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:24.465
Nice. She is crazy.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:31.138
We won.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.941
DUE TO CORROSION AND POTENTIAL DANGER,
THIS BRIDGE IS OUT OF SERVICE

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.823
<i>During my first year in elementary school,</i>

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.911
<i>Saori moved to our village from Tokyo.</i>

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:00.084
What?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.927
<i>Saori looked as cute as a doll,</i>

00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:13.555
<i>and was gentle like the Virgin Mary.</i>

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.935
STICKER BOOK

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:26.819
<i>However, she was ostracized
by the villagers.</i>

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:32.992
<i>They said she mocked us countryside folks.</i>

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.412
<i>They were so delusional.</i>

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.414
<i>And so…</i>

00:16:42.501 --> 00:16:44.211
<i>They chased Saori out of the village.</i>

00:16:44.294 --> 00:16:47.423
PROPERTY FOR SALE

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.967
<i>They are all disgusting.</i>

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.427
GARBAGE
GO BACK TO TOKYO

00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:57.683
<i>Saori treated me to handmade snacks
I had never even heard of,</i>

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:02.813
<i>smiled and said to me,
"The ones from the shops taste better."</i>

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:11.030
<i>If I stayed in that village, I would have…</i>

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:14.950
Didn't I tell you?

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.411
It's dangerous to travel alone,
so take it seriously.

00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:20.247
You didn't say
it was dangerous to go alone!

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.957
Didn't I say that?

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:23.667
Anyway, what did you eat growing up

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:25.878
to break through
a wall with your bare hands?

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:28.255
It's because there are
no steel reinforcement bars!

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:30.966
Even without those,
a normal person couldn't have done it!

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:33.927
What do you mean by "normal person"?

00:17:34.678 --> 00:17:38.015
By the way, I've been asked before…

00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.350
But why did you come
to Jujutsu High School?

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:41.852
Why, you ask me?

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.857 line:20%
Because I hate the countryside
and I want to live in Tokyo!

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.484
What?

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:54.948
This is the only way to get to Tokyo
without worrying about the cost.

00:17:55.032 --> 00:17:57.618
You would actually risk your life
for that reason?

00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:02.081
Of course.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.165
What?

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.212
I live for myself.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:15.344
<i>If I stayed in that village,
I would be as good as dead.</i>

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:29.149
<i>Saori, I'm in Tokyo.</i>

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.322
<i>If we meet again,</i>

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:40.160
<i>be sure to take me
to the shop you mentioned.</i>

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:48.544
I'm thankful to you.

00:18:48.627 --> 00:18:51.755
Even if I died or survived alone,

00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.841
I would never have a bright future.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:55.843
Thank you.

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:57.803
Well…

00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:00.973
It's not like having a serious reason
makes it sound more remarkable.

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:03.725
All right! Since I’ve thanked you,
we're even now!

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.644
I don't owe you anything!

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.354
What's wrong with her?

00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.358
My house is just up ahead. Thank you!

00:19:14.444 --> 00:19:17.489
Do you know that I get grumpy
when I'm hungry?

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.825
Is there any time where you're not grumpy?

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.912
-Good work, you guys!
-What?

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:25.747
The child has reached home safely.

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.376
Let's go eat for real now.

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:33.005
-Steak!
-Sushi!

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:35.841
Just leave it to me!

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:36.967
What about you, Megumi?

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:40.470
What?

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:42.556
-Well then, let's go.
-Hey.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:46.351
<i>Hey.</i>

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.937
<i>I forgot the biggest gain of the day.</i>

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.356
You, help me get my luggage.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.274
What?

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.194
Why should I? I thought we're even now.

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:58.197
It was my curse that defeated it.
Is there any problem?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.407
You don't know
what I'm capable of, do you?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.868
You eat gross stuff
and have nothing but muscles.

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.369
It's more than that!

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.829
Right, Fushiguro?

00:20:06.997 --> 00:20:08.790
What's wrong, Fushiguro?

00:20:08.874 --> 00:20:09.708
Nothing.

00:20:09.791 --> 00:20:11.668
He's angry because he didn't get to play.

00:20:11.752 --> 00:20:14.171
How childish!

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:27.851
<i>Record, July 2018,
Eishu Detention Center, West Tokyo City.</i>

00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:33.357
<i>Above the stadium.</i>

00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:36.610
Hey.

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:39.363
What's that?

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:41.615
Let me see.

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:45.410
<i>Special Grade Imaginary Cursed Spirit,
name unidentified.</i>

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:50.415
<i>Several non-sorcerers
witnessed the Cursed Womb.</i>

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.418
That one. It looks like an egg.

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.045
Like I said, where is it?

00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:01.134
<i>In response to this emergency,
three first-year students were dispatched.</i>

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.388
<i>One casualty reported.</i>

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.148
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.650
I'll use paper, Itadori.

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.653
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:22:43.737 --> 00:22:44.780
All right!

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:47.574
Are we eating sushi?
Let's go to the usual place in Ginza.

00:22:47.657 --> 00:22:49.785
Ginza, all right!

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:51.286
I want to have sushi train.

00:22:51.369 --> 00:22:52.287
What?

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.122
You're hopeless, Itadori.

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.791
Say something too, Fushiguro!

00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.918
I would like to eat something good, too.

00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.294
Since Mr. Gojo is paying.

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:01.713
Instant yakisoba
and yakisoba are different,

00:23:01.797 --> 00:23:03.715
and so are sushi and sushi train!

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.425
I just want to eat sushi.

00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.928
Sushi is food
while sushi train is an entertainment!

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:10.180
Like the difference
between theme parks and TDL!

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:12.599
Also, Kugisaki,
you said you came from the boonies!

00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:14.434
-Have you ever had sushi train?
-What…

00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.478
My favorite is Sushi Go.

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:18.480
But for starters, I'd go with Rippa Sushi.

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:20.232
You're so knowledgeable, Mr. Gojo.

00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:21.441
We haven't decided yet.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.568
Kugisaki, listen up.

00:23:23.652 --> 00:23:24.945
At Rippa Sushi,

00:23:25.028 --> 00:23:27.948
the sushi will be delivered
on the bullet train.

00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:29.199
<i>What?</i>

00:23:29.282 --> 00:23:32.119
Driver, it's her first time
eating rotation sushi.

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:35.872 line:20%
Head to the Rippa Sushi outlet with a huge
parking lot along the national highway!
