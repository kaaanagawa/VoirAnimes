WEBVTT

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.443
Don't look up without my permission.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.320
It makes me sick, brat.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.741
Then come on down.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.951
I'll look down on you.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.847
You look rather mad.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.809
Of course, I was killed by you.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:26.312
Have you forgotten
that I've healed your hands?

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.149
But then you took my heart out,
didn't you?

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.069
Is this hell?

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.448
I don't like the idea that
I'm stuck with you even after I'm dead.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:39.951
But that's fine.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:41.327
I'll make you cry!

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.211
Grit your teeth!

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.180
<i>He was aiming for the ground
from the beginning.</i>

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.515
You've been tricked!

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:03.975
<i>I did it!</i>

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:05.935
What?

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.521
You're so boring.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.069
I thought I had that one in the bag.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.447
Darn it.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.115
This isn't hell.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.576
It's my Innate Domain.

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.536 line:20%
Innate Domain?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.705 line:20%
I think Fushiguro mentioned this before.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:28.291
Think of this place
as somewhere inside my mind.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.669
-This means we’re not dead yet.
-What?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:34.047 line:20%
As long as you agree to my terms,

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.674 line:20%
I'll heal your heart
and bring you back to life.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.384
You talk like you're so big.

00:03:38.468 --> 00:03:42.013
You've been putting on airs,
but you just don't want to die either!

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:44.432 line:20%
Circumstances have changed.

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:45.725
Soon,

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:48.519
<i>you'll be able to witness
something interesting.</i>

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:52.232
I have two conditions.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.109
First, if I recite the chant "Enchain,"

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:57.528
you must lend me your body for one minute.

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:00.782
Second, you must forget
about this agreement.

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:01.866
No way.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.827
I don't know what your motive is,
but it's too suspicious!

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.205
After going through all that,
I finally understand.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:11.501
You're evil.
I'll never lend you my body again.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:16.798
Then I promise you, I won't kill
or hurt anyone within that one minute.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:18.967
This is so annoying.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.551
Who would believe that?

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:23.680
<i>There's no need to believe my words.</i>

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.390
<i>This is a Binding Vow.</i>

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:27.016
<i>In other words, an oath.</i>

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.644
<i>If I don't keep my promise,
I'll be punished.</i>

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.565
<i>If you take excess advantage
of our relationship,</i>

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:38.736
<i>you'll have to pay the price.
You should have experienced it before.</i>

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.781
But nothing happened to you!

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:42.907
What?

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:46.995
Oh, I wanted to take over your body
that time, too.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.540
<i>And you only did it because
that Jujutsu Sorcerer told you to do so.</i>

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.548
<i>A Binding Vow with mutual interests
is one of the important creeds in sorcery.</i>

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.721
I see. Move aside.
I'll accept your conditions.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:13.396
I don't know what you're up to,

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.357 line:20%
but it's all for the sake of
coming back to life!

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.487
As if I'll say that.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.781
Revive me with no conditions.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.576
I died because of you in the first place.

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:28.953
Let's do this, then.

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:32.582
Let's have a fight, and if you win,
I'll revive you unconditionally.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.877
If I win, I'll use
my Binding Vow to resurrect.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.962
Fine by me. I'll beat you to--

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:46.429
I…

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.514
I have a horrible personality, right?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.432
I know.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.684
I'm going to give you
a good slap later, Ijichi.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.644
A "good slap"?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.147
I'm not fit to be a teacher.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.734
But despite so,
why am I a teacher in a high school?

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:01.110
Ask me.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.154
Why?

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.573
I have a dream.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.575
A dream, you say?

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:08.826
That's right.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.120
As you can see from what happened to Yuji,

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.790
the higher-ups are the evil den
of the world of sorcery.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:17.335
They are all a bunch of selfish,
hereditary, arrogant,

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:18.544
and ordinary fools.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:21.297
It's like rotten oranges on sale.

00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.176
I'm going to reset
this rotten sorcery world.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:30.640
It's easy to just kill the higher-ups.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.434
But a new group of people
will replace them eventually.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:35.144
It makes no difference.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:38.606
And no one would be
willing to join my cause.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.568
<i>That's why I chose education.</i>

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.614
<i>I want to nurture strong
and intelligent comrades.</i>

00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:51.702
That is why I entrust my tasks
to my students at times.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.914
-They are my lashings of love.
<i>-Weren't you just trying to skip work?</i>

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:56.582
All of them are outstanding.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:00.253
<i>Especially the third-year Hakari
and second-year Okkotsu.</i>

00:07:00.336 --> 00:07:03.089
<i>They will grow to be as strong as me.</i>

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.175
Yuji was supposed to be
one of them as well.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.972
Hey, you two.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:12.056
-What?
-What?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.560
I'm about to start. Are you guys
going to watch from there?

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.146
What?

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.857
Wow, I'm naked.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.862
-Mr. Gojo, he's alive…
-Shut up, Ijichi!

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:27.363
What a shame.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.449
Excuse me, but I'm embarrassed.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.366
Who are you?

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.284
Yuji.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:32.201
What?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.119
GET DRESSED FIRST

00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.704
Welcome back.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.748
Hey! I'm back.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.924
I have to amend the report.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.593
No, you don't have to.

00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:49.594
What?

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:51.345
We need some time for Yuji

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:54.724
to gain strength
before he's targeted again.

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:59.103
Shoko, please state in the report
that Yuji is dead for now.

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.062
What?

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:02.899
Then are you going to
hide Itadori forever?

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:03.816
No.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.152
I'll let him return
before the exchange program.

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:07.069
Why?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.529
The reason is simple.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:13.493
<i>It's a sin to rob
the youth off of young people.</i>

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:16.245
Will everyone be shocked?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.165
It's the same for everyone.

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.049
<i>I'm going to quit my job now.</i>

00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.093
<i>I've been a responsible person
since I was young.</i>

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:35.139
<i>I've saved up all my wages
to send my four stepsisters to school.</i>

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.808
<i>But even I can't fight
against my survival instincts!</i>

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:40.144
<i>If I get closer to that table, I'll die.</i>

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.146
Satoru Gojo.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.942
Is it impossible for us
to defeat him together?

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.902
He'll either escape easily,

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:50.571
or exorcise all of you, at worst.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:55.743
Instead of killing him, I would suggest
you find a way to seal him.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.538
Seal? With what?

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:02.458 line:20%
We can use a Special Grade Cursed Relic
known as the Prison Realm.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.336
Prison Realm?

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:07.922
Table five doesn't order anything at all.

00:09:08.005 --> 00:09:11.467
Can anyone go and check it out?
There's only one person at that table.

00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.177
I'm sorry, Manager.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.429
-I'm going to quit my job!
-What?

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.890
Hey, wait!

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:21.352 line:20%
Do you have that taboo object with you?

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:24.105
What? The air-conditioner
is turned on, right?

00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:27.733
Jogo, don't get too excited.
It's getting hot in here.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:32.822
Sir, have you decided what to order--

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.747
Don't create a scene.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:43.666
I'm sure this is fine.

00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:47.378
What?

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.806
Luckily, I didn't choose
a high-class restaurant.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.028 line:20%
Geto, how many fingers of Sukuna
are equal to my strength?

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:15.448
As an overestimation,
around eight or nine?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.410
That's more than enough.
Hand me the Prison Realm.

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.911
I'm adding it to my collection.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.873 line:20%
In return…

00:10:24.665 --> 00:10:26.417 line:20%
I'll kill Satoru Gojo.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:28.377
Help--

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:41.724
When we arrived at the scene,
your son had already passed away.

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:47.480
To be honest, I was hesitant
to save the people there.

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:50.483
But my comrades said otherwise.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.527
<i>Although we didn't make it,</i>

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:58.074
<i>he insisted on bringing his body back
even after his death was confirmed.</i>

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:01.243
Please.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:06.582
TADASHI OKAZAKI

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.214
So I brought this back.

00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:17.051
TADASHI OKAZAKI

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.803
I'm extremely sorry that

00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.430
I'm unable to save Tadashi.

00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:26.268
It's okay. Don't apologize.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.687
I'm the only one…

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.233
who's sad about his death.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.827
You're too slow, Megumi.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:43.869
Seaweed.

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.037
What were you doing?

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.372
It's not important.

00:11:47.915 --> 00:11:49.959
-Zenin.
-Yes?

00:11:50.459 --> 00:11:53.754
As a Jujutsu Sorcerer,
what kind of people do you want to save?

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:54.880
What?

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.467
I'm not interested in the people I save.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.844
I shouldn't have asked you.

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:00.761
What?

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.346
Fushiguro!

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.766
It's not the time for interviews!

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.230
I'm sick of my school uniform!
Let me buy some cute sportswear!

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.732
Here it comes!

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:17.027
What are they doing?

00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:19.155
-Falling practice.
-Mustard.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.240
You two are weak at fighting close-range.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:22.950
First of all…

00:12:24.785 --> 00:12:26.871
Try to take one point from us.

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:28.539
Then we'll talk later.

00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:34.128
You should do a lot better than the others
in close-range combat, Yuji.

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:35.963
What you need to learn now is

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.798
to control your cursed energy,

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:41.218
and some basic knowledge of curse.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:42.386
SMILING

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.721
What's wrong?

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:45.848
Oh, I just thought that

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.185
you're the best person
to train me, so I'm happy.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.230
<i>I'm weak, and couldn't save anyone.</i>

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.400
<i>Not only that, I nearly killed Fushiguro.</i>

00:12:56.484 --> 00:13:00.571
<i>I'm too ashamed to meet them.</i>

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:03.532
I want to be stronger.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:07.661 line:20%
Teach me how to become the strongest.

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:13.417
You've got a keen eye.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.795
But you said
you're the strongest, Mr. Gojo.

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:21.008
All right. Please look at
the two juice cans over there.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.305
Wow!

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:30.059
I used cursed energy on this can
and cursed technique on this one.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.102
I see. I don't understand.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.063
Well, let's see.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:36.190
<i>Let's compare cursed energy to electricity</i>

00:13:36.273 --> 00:13:38.984
<i>and cursed techniques
to electrical appliances.</i>

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:42.112
<i>Electricity alone has limited uses, right?</i>

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:47.201
<i>So electricity is charged into electrical
appliances for various purposes.</i>

00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:50.955
<i>This can was blasted by cursed energy</i>

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.415
<i>and this can was twisted</i>

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.418
<i>by infusing cursed energy
into a cursed technique.</i>

00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:01.090
So that means I'm going to learn
a lot of cool techniques!

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:03.425
No, you can't use curse.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.177
What?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.681
Let's not talk about basic Shikigami
or barrier techniques.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.474
Basically, cursed techniques are

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:13.185
engraved on a Jujutsu Sorcerer's body
when he was born.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.688
-What?
-Thus, it's said that…

00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:19.108
80% of a Jujutsu Sorcerer's strength
comes from their innate talent.

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:22.236
Are you okay?

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:23.404
Well…

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:27.575
I just thought I could have skills
like thunder, fire, or power bomb.

00:14:27.658 --> 00:14:30.494
You should be able to perform
a power bomb. Are you Onita?

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.539 line:20%
Forget about it then.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.501 line:20%
I wanted to use Spirit Gun, Bankai,
Rasengan, or Dodonpa…

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.087
-I thought I could use them…
<i>-You just can't use it now.</i>

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.424
<i>One day, Sukuna's techniques
will be engraved into your body.</i>

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.510
-I wanted to use Kamehameha…
-Let's put aside what you can't do.

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:48.220
I'll further develop your strengths

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.347
and add cursed energy
to your martial arts.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:51.932
Ignore useless curse techniques.

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:54.768
I'm scared of people like you
bulldozing through with basics!

00:14:54.852 --> 00:14:56.020
-What?
-As I said earlier,

00:14:56.103 --> 00:14:58.689
you have an impressive talent
for physical combat.

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.735
But I'm already good at it!

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:03.944
Get up, will you?

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:06.530
<i>At that time, I mastered
the trick without knowing.</i>

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:13.579
Well then, let's try it. Hit here.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:15.497
I bet you can't do it.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.541
I don't care if you get hurt.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.001
Just hurry up already.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.674
There's no cursed energy in it.

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:26.926
Why?

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:29.678
The source of cursed energy
is negative emotions.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:31.347
When you said "that time,"

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.974
you were full of anger and fear, right?

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:38.938 line:20%
Oh, do we have to be angry
in order to use cursed energy?

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.608
Right, Fushiguro always looks like
he's about to snap.

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:44.109
Divine Dog!

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:46.737
You're wrong.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.073
What is it?

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:51.533
-I feel annoyed all of a sudden.
-What?

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.535
-No, it's not because of you.
-Salmon roe.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.538
The event is only a month and a half away.
Let's not waste time.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:15:58.958
Let's continue.
Try out this long one here.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.754
This feels surprisingly nice to hold.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.299
Everyone undergoes training to draw

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.468
cursed energy
from a single spark of emotion.

00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.137
<i>When you're too emotional…</i>

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:13.222
I'm mad!

00:16:13.305 --> 00:16:15.683
<i>…you should avoid wasting cursed energy.</i>

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.603
There are many ways to learn,

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.272
but I'll let you do one
that's really tiring.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.233
What is it?

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.527
Watching movies.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.028
Watching movies?

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:29.530
That's right.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:33.158
It ranges from classic masterpieces
to C-class horror, even artistic French!

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.661
As long as you're awake,
you have to keep watching it.

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:37.746
Of course, it's not that easy.

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.251
You have to watch it with this guy.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.586
What's with that disgustingly cute doll?

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.630
Does this look cute?

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.674
It's a Cursed Corpse
made by the principal.

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:51.093
Oh, I knew it!
Looks like something he would make.

00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:59.268
So? I don't understand the point of it.

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.770
Don't rush. It's starting soon.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.234
If that doesn't receive
a constant flow of cursed energy,

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.570
it will wake up and attack you, like now.

00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:12.239
It hurts!

00:17:12.322 --> 00:17:13.574
Like I said,

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:16.326
there are a variety of movies.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.912
It will make you anxious, angry, excited.

00:17:18.996 --> 00:17:21.498
Some will make you cry, laugh,
or just plain disgusted!

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.585
First, try to sit through an entire movie

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:27.004
without waking the doll up
and hurting yourself.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.799
This training helps you maintain
a constant flow of cursed energy

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:32.426
regardless of what you're feeling.

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:34.470
You can't emit too much
or too little power.

00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:43.937
I've set the required amount of energy
to the bare minimum you are able to emit.

00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:48.484
But the required flow
will increase slowly, so don't slack off.

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:51.320
I can't slack off even if I want to.

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.239
Which one do you want to watch first?
I recommend this one.

00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:57.076
The heroine's a nasty girl,
but she gets a gaudy death.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:58.786
That's a huge spoiler.

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.246
Let's see.
We should watch an action movie--

00:18:02.831 --> 00:18:04.541
Jeez!

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:07.711
Come on! You have to keep the flow stable
even if you're irritated.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.298
How to carry a Cursed Tool?

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:14.760
I agree to using special weapons
to enhance close-range combat.

00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:18.555
But I would like to keep myself
hands-free to use techniques.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.266
It also uses up time to sheathe a knife.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:25.813
You carry multiple Cursed Tools,
right, Zenin?

00:18:25.896 --> 00:18:27.189
How do you manage them?

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:28.899
I let Panda carry them.

00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:31.235
<i>Once again, I shouldn't have asked her.</i>

00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:35.864
There are Jujutsu Sorcerers that
tame familiars to store weapons for them.

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:38.575
That's impossible to learn.
It's a rare ability, too.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.953
It also takes time to tame it.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:42.663
Let me know if you find one.

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.456
A year's supply of Karpas.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.334
<i>I don't understand. Back then…</i>

00:18:50.337 --> 00:18:51.755
<i>Why did you escape?</i>

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.925
It's a waste of your talent.

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:58.929
<i>He thinks that I have the potential to
defeat that Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.932
<i>Is that what he meant?</i>

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.230
Tuna…

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.148
What?

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:10.065
What's wrong?

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:12.568
Zenin.

00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:15.571
I think I might be able to do something.

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:21.577
Urahara!

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.537
Where's Urahara? Is it underground?

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:29.543
<i>Red and blue wire, which one should I cut?</i>

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:34.798
<i>There was a garbage collection point
near my old address.</i>

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:37.634
<i>Hey, what are you talking about?</i>

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:40.804
<i>We throw plastic waste into the red bin,
combustibles into the blue.</i>

00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:43.974
<i>I thought to myself,
"Shouldn't it be the other way round?"</i>

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:46.310
<i>That's right, it's usually red.</i>

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:49.313
<i>I'll believe you.</i>

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:07.956
Don't do it when I'm drinking cola!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.208
Don't drink, then.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.002
You always have snacks and cola
while watching movies!

00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.337
You're right.

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:18.717
Well then, I have something to do,
so keep working hard.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.136
Can I really grow stronger with this?

00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.432
Oh, right.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:28.393
Have you talked to Sukuna
while you're dead?

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.020
Talk?

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.734
Did he offer you any conditions
or contracts to fix your heart?

00:20:35.817 --> 00:20:37.236
Yes…

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:39.446
I think he said something.

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:42.699
I can't really remember.

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:44.868
Is that so?

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:52.668
We still have time before
our appointment with the principal.

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:54.378
Do you want to take a short detour?

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:57.631
No, I should be early once in a while.

00:21:01.927 --> 00:21:02.803 line:20%
Stop the car.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:04.638 line:20%
What? Right here?

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:07.140
-You can go first.
-What?

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:09.434
Is this some kind of test?

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.853
Are you going to beat me up if I leave?

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.689
Who do you think I am?

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.440
Okay, I'll leave then.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:24.700
Well then…

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:35.252 line:20%
Who are you?

00:23:06.593 --> 00:23:08.553
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:13.058
<i>"Satoru Gojo's Go-Go-Gojo!"</i>

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:17.562 line:20%
Today, we're at my alma mater,
Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School.

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:18.563 line:20%
What?

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.273 line:20%
And here's a student in trouble.

00:23:20.357 --> 00:23:21.650 line:20%
Is he a freshman?

00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:24.820 line:20%
He can't seem to extract cursed energy.
Let's give him some advice.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:28.406
You're walking down a narrow road.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.867
There's a row of male students
in front of you.

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:32.702
They didn't notice you.

00:23:32.786 --> 00:23:34.371
You feel like killing them, right?

00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:35.997
-So--
-Shut up.
