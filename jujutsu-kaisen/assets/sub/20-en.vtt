00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.305
<i>When I was in third grade,</i>

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.142 line:20%
<i>I beat up a high school student
who was being arrogant.</i>

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.143 line:20%
<i>WRITING, MATHEMATICS</i>

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:25.734
<i>He may be older than me,
but arrogance is arrogance.</i>

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.653
<i>When others look down on me…</i>

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:34.534
<i>and I can feel that they
are looking down on me,</i>

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.912
<i>the bell that indicates
the start of a fight starts ringing.</i>

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.707
<i>It's nothing interesting, really.</i>

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.586 line:20%
<i>Beating up a boring guy
is still going to be boring.</i>

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:48.882 line:20%
What?

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.303
What kind of woman…

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.513
do you like?

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.433
Who are you?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.562
<i>I had a feeling that…</i>

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.647
<i>I wouldn't feel bored anymore.</i>

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:50.795
It's time to unleash my cursed technique.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.754
What?

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.381
Didn't you use it before?

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:57.552
However, I don't have time
to explain it in detail now.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.680
I can only tell you one thing…

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.348
Don't stop.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.434
Believe in me!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.728
Only two things, right?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.274
<i>Let me review its moves.</i>

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.527
<i>Roots emerge from the ground.</i>

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:18.072
<i>I believe that the smaller the scale,</i>

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.074
<i>the stronger and faster it would be.</i>

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:21.951
<i>Wooden Ball.</i>

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.121
<i>Each Wooden Ball can launch
one or two attacks.</i>

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.915
<i>Then it will disappear.</i>

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.959
<i>I need to watch the time gap
since it can be controlled midair.</i>

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:31.461
<i>Cursed Bud.</i>

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.963
<i>I think Fushiguro got hit by that.</i>

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.382
<i>Will it be over
if they plant it into someone?</i>

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.219
<i>If so, I hope there's a limit
to how many it can use.</i>

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.887
<i>Flower Field.</i>

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.097
<i>It can distract his opponents.</i>

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.433
<i>But my injury is making me focus better.</i>

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.227
<i>I don't need to be too wary of that.</i>

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.730
<i>Not to forget the left arm it revealed.</i>

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.236
<i>Also, the possibility that
everything could be a disguise!</i>

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.488
<i>But regardless of its cursed technique,</i>

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.032
<i>I'll just prevent it from using it.</i>

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.369
<i>Considering this
is an emergency situation,</i>

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:07.497
<i>my IQ of 530,000…</i>

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:14.087
<i>and my CPU brain has concluded
that the outcome should be…</i>

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.304
<i>Why? Because I'm not alone.</i>

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.892
<i>Because you're here!</i>

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.270
What?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.194
Todo!

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:45.868
Todo!

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.290
First one down.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.467
What…

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:02.677
What?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.761
Todo!

00:05:03.845 --> 00:05:05.388
I see.

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.056
It's so simple.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.185
Therefore, it's a troublesome
cursed technique.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:16.232
Yes, my cursed technique allows me
to trade places with someone else.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:17.692
Boogie Woogie!

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:20.862 line:20%
Todo.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.324 line:20%
Eliminate the opponent first
before it adjusts to it.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:33.333
By the way,
clapping is the way to activate it!

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:49.057
<i>Their physical differences…</i>

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.350
<i>feel more significant
after trading places.</i>

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:59.025 line:20%
<i>Am I the object of the trade,
or is it Sukuna's vessel?</i>

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:02.070 line:20%
<i>When he claps his hand,
I'm forced to choose either one.</i>

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.821 line:20%
<i>It slows down my judgment.</i>

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.412 line:20%
<i>Not good. This is…</i>

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:31.432
<i>I can't escape!</i>

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.273 line:20%
<i>It's coming again!</i>

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.696 line:20%
<i>Continuous use of Black Flash
isn't amazing at all.</i>

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:52.286 line:20%
It is hard to use it more than twice

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.456 line:20%
unless unleashed consecutively
on the same day.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.585
<i>The reason behind the first success
might be one's luck or capability.</i>

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.337
<i>After using Black Flash,</i>

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.467
<i>a sorcerer will enter the zone,
similar to what athletes experience.</i>

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:12.348
The thinking process revolving around
sorcery becomes as easy as breathing.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:15.518
You feel like
you're the center of everything,

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.311
and that you're omnipotent.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.981
I guess it can be described like this?

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.484
My record, you ask?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:28.030
Four times.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:30.992
It was just pure luck.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.708
Black Flash!

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.376
<i>Brother.</i>

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.129 line:20%
<i>You always give me this premonition.</i>

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:52.263
Black Flash.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.519
Black Flash.

00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:01.022 line:20%
<i>Three times in a row.</i>

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.274
Don't get ahead of yourself!

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:06.986
<i>Trading places?</i>

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.113 line:20%
<i>I should be careful of…</i>

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.032
<i>Sukuna's…</i>

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.243
<i>They didn't change places!</i>

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:23.252
Clapping my hands doesn't mean
that I'll activate the cursed technique.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:27.006
It's simple, but you fell for it.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:29.425
<i>It's the same as before.</i>

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:33.221
<i>I have a feeling that
I wouldn't feel bored anymore!</i>

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.894
<i>Black Flash.</i>

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.480
<i>It attacked right after the switch.</i>

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:27.858
<i>Looks like it's getting used to
Todo's cursed technique.</i>

00:09:28.484 --> 00:09:31.988
<i>But the continuous Black Flash
just now was effective.</i>

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:35.116
<i>Both of us can exorcise it!</i>

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.246
<i>This is the first time in my life
I've suffered such a serious injury.</i>

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.124
<i>Even so…</i>

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:48.629
<i>The thrill of fighting
has not disappeared!</i>

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:09.233
<i>The explanation of his
cursed technique seems phony.</i>

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:13.529
<i>Can he trade other people's places
besides himself?</i>

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:14.864
Todo!

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.783
<i>He tried to protect me…</i>

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.536
<i>Don't worry, brother.</i>

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:25.041
<i>If I defend with my body
and cursed energy,</i>

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:27.460
<i>this level of Cursed Buds…</i>

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.254
<i>I'll deflect them all.</i>

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.970
Are you sure?

00:10:40.931 --> 00:10:43.309
Takada?

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:48.731
Do you remember Fushiguro's wound?

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.483
Of course!

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:53.736
My opponent is shooting
Cursed Buds at me now.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:54.862
That's why I…

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.197
However,

00:10:56.697 --> 00:11:00.117
the buds inside Fushiguro
grew a little, right?

00:11:03.954 --> 00:11:07.208
Did it grow because it absorbed his blood?

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.210
It could be.

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:11.879
But his opponent was a Cursed Spirit.

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:15.049
What is the most possible reason?

00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:21.347
Cursed energy.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.848
TOOK PLACE FOR 0.01 SECONDS

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.274
<i>He withdrew his cursed energy
at the last moment!</i>

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.526
<i>Did he find out about it?</i>

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.821
<i>The stronger the protective cursed energy,</i>

00:11:36.904 --> 00:11:39.198
<i>the bigger the Cursed Buds will grow.</i>

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:42.368
Is the NHE coming soon?

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:44.370 line:20%
NHE, NATIONAL HANDSHAKE EVENT

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:46.789
I must express my gratitude to her.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.457
Right?

00:11:58.008 --> 00:11:59.927
<i>Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.266
<i>You should have noticed
that my explanation was incomplete.</i>

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:10.646
<i>But you still need
to consider one more thing.</i>

00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:13.566 line:20%
<i>That is the target of Boogie Woogie.</i>

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.780
<i>Can I only switch the positions
of living creatures within my range?</i>

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:25.369
<i>My cursed technique works on anything,
including Cursed Corpses!</i>

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.329
<i>So the answer is…</i>

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:31.125
<i>it works on anything
with enough cursed energy!</i>

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:36.714 line:20%
<i>Special Grade Cursed Spirit,
have you noticed?</i>

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.427
<i>We're back to the same place.</i>

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.597
<i>That thing is sleeping inside!</i>

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.481
Maki's Special Grade Cursed Tool
is under the river.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.067
The tree branches on its face
are particularly fragile.

00:13:00.404 --> 00:13:01.739
The river?

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:05.284
What did I switch positions with?

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:09.121
<i>Special Grade Cursed Tool.</i>

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.213
<i>Playful Cloud!</i>

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.933
<i>I imbued my cursed energy
on this Special Grade Cursed Tool,</i>

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:30.809
<i>but I still can't exorcise it.</i>

00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:31.894
What?

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.243
Plants cannot breed cursed energy.

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:51.497
My left hand can absorb
life from other plants

00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:54.625
and convert it into cursed energy.

00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:59.380
The cursed energy won't recharge my body.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:02.508
However, it will flow into this flower.

00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.594
I didn't want to use this, if possible.

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.104
Todo!

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:16.480
Don't come here, brother!

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.774
This output of cursed energy
is extraordinary.

00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:23.612
It's easy for you to avoid it
using your cursed technique.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:26.407
In that case, what should I do?

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:29.159 line:20%
Domain--

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:32.997
The Veil…

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:02.276
<i>I see.</i>

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:06.030
<i>I was wondering how can he be
so loud without loudspeakers.</i>

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:09.366
<i>This old man is a loudspeaker himself.</i>

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.371
<i>His cursed technique amplifies
the music he plays and launches it.</i>

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:17.625
<i>A predictable mid-range fighter.</i>

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.544
<i>He obviously doesn't want me
to go near him.</i>

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:25.215
I'll make a wallet then.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:27.927
A wallet filled with an old man's smell.

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:35.184
Understood.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.603
Go and meet with Shoko, Nishimiya.

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:43.025
It's okay, Mei Mei will look after Miwa.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.322
<i>Luckily, reception is still
working on phones.</i>

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:51.200
<i>This is normal
due to the nature of the Veil.</i>

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.452 line:20%
Someone in Jujutsu High School…

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.330 line:20%
is colluding with
Cursed Users or Cursed Spirits.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.833
<i>Looks like it's not a misunderstanding.</i>

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:02.670
What?

00:16:06.256 --> 00:16:09.051
I thought I got you.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.303
<i>A human?</i>

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.013
<i>Is he a Curse User?</i>

00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:17.309
This is why…

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:22.606
Looks pretty good, right?

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:26.402
Juzo made this for me.

00:16:27.403 --> 00:16:29.154
Didn't you see him just now?

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:34.660
You are weak,
so let the katana support you.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.286
That's what he said.

00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:42.584
What can you give me, miss?

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.921
-You're not popular with girls, right?
-What?

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:49.425
We've only just met,
and you keep talking about yourself.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.260
I'm charging you money.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:55.472
Are you qualified to charge people
for being their listener?

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:59.226
-You guys!
-Shut up! Don't argue with me!

00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:00.144
What?

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.271
Gosh!

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:06.400
There are so many girls! I'm so popular!

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.319
Are you listening to us?

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:11.280
I'll be the support.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:13.532
Be careful not to get shot by mistake.

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:15.492
You should be careful!

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.501
The Veil is lifted?

00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:29.214
Really? It's not even 30 minutes.

00:17:29.298 --> 00:17:30.716
I'm running!

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:35.262
What's wrong with him?

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:41.060
Hey!

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:46.607
The dazzling clothing rack
is right in front of my eyes.

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.778
Now then…

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:52.696
Where should I start?

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.493
Is that…

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:05.292
<i>Seems like this is as far as we get.</i>

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:06.752
What?

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:08.295
Mr. Gojo?

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:18.555
<i>Yuji's level…</i>

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:21.558
<i>He has greatly improved.</i>

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.895
<i>I see. It must be Aoi.</i>

00:18:25.395 --> 00:18:27.898
<i>He really works well with Yuji.</i>

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.818
<i>Looks like they are fighting
a Special Grade.</i>

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.569
<i>I shouldn't worry about them.</i>

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:36.198
<i>In that case, my priority would be…</i>

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:39.660
You.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:43.247
Clothing rack!

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.124 line:20%
Don't kill him!

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:57.469
I have many questions to ask him.

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.305
Don't let him die.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.974
Come on, heal him.

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:10.649
<i>The Curse User who attacked
Utahime has disappeared.</i>

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.986
<i>Were they planning to escape all along?</i>

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.864
<i>Is that the only one left?</i>

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.116
<i>That one is good at escaping, too.</i>

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.703
<i>This place is quite far away from Yuji.</i>

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.788
<i>I have no choice.</i>

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:27.457
Let's be a little violent.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.961
Cursed Technique Lapse, Blue.

00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:33.714
Cursed Technique Reversal, Red.

00:19:37.718 --> 00:19:38.969
I'm withdrawing.

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:42.639
I'm not conceited enough to believe
that I can take on Satoru Gojo.

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.891
Are you serious?

00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:46.518 line:20%
What are you trying to do?

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.146
Wait a minute, brother!

00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.231
Todo, why are you stopping me?

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:54.902
Don't get any closer.

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.157
You'll be swept into it.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.162
<i>Hollow…</i>

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.750
<i>Purple.</i>

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:38.946
He's still beyond common sense, as always.

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.280
Gosh…

00:20:41.156 --> 00:20:44.493
I can't even tell if the Cursed Spirit
was exorcised or not.

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:47.246
It hurts!

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:48.872
It hurts so much!

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.040
Shut up!

00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:51.583
All right!

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.627
Everything's resolved!

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.006
<i>Of course, it's not that simple.</i>

00:21:07.015 --> 00:21:09.059
I wonder if Hanami is okay.

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:12.479
Mission accomplished.

00:22:46.448 --> 00:22:48.366
<i>-Juju Stroll.
-Salmon.</i>

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.993
ARE YOU A DOG OR A CAT PERSON?

00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:51.620 line:20%
I'm a dog person.

00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:54.664 line:20%
No, maybe I'm a cat person.

00:22:55.165 --> 00:22:57.834 line:20%
Wait a minute.
I'll choose dog if it's a large one.

00:22:58.752 --> 00:22:59.586 line:20%
Dogs.

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:01.379 line:20%
I think dogs.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.632 line:20%
What? I'm definitely a cat person.

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.175 line:20%
Salmon.

00:23:05.258 --> 00:23:09.262 line:20%
Of course, I'm a panda person!
Do you want me to kill you?

00:23:10.847 --> 00:23:16.895
Does everyone dislike me?

00:23:16.978 --> 00:23:19.397
No. It's just that
there are only two options.

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.857
Ignore him.

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:27.364 line:20%
