WEBVTT

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:08.508
Our window confirmed
the existence of the Cursed Womb

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:10.135
approximately three hours ago.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.304
When the evacuation rate reached 90%,

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.558
we sealed off the facility
upon evaluation of the scene.

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:20.937
<i>Residents within a radius of 500 meters
have also been evacuated.</i>

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.940
I have a question, Mr. Ijichi.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.608
What is a "window"?

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:30.697
A window is an authorized combat personnel
who can confirm curses by sight.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.949
However, they are not Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.617
Oh, I see.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.785
Allow me to continue.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.122
<i>Inside Dorm 2 of this detention center,</i>

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:44.252
<i>there are five prisoners left
with the Cursed Womb.</i>

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:47.547
If the Cursed Womb manages to mutate,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.426 line:20%
we predict that it will transform
into a Special Grade Cursed Spirit.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.178
<i>-Special Grade…
-Special Grade…</i>

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:58.016
Hey, I still don't really get
all this "Special Grade" stuff.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.642
Well then…

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.437 line:20%
Let me explain it
so that fools can understand.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.397 line:20%
First, Grade 4 Curses.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.191 line:20%
A wooden bat will suffice.

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:09.319 line:20%
Grade 3 Curses.
You're probably safe with a gun.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.780 line:20%
Grade 2 Curses.
You'll barely make it with a shotgun.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.657 line:20%
Grade 1 Curses. You won't feel safe
even with a military tank.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.659 line:20%
And then we have the Special Grade Curses,

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:20.038
which you'll probably require
rapid carpet bombing.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.498
That's very dangerous!

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.877
Usually, they dispatch Jujutsu Sorcerers
with an equal level to the Cursed Spirit.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:28.963
In today's case,
it would have been someone like Mr. Gojo.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:30.173
I see.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.092
So where's Mr. Gojo?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.303
-He's on a business trip.
-What?

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.305
In the first place, someone of his caliber

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.724
wasn't supposed to be
wasting time in a high school.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.976
Don't expect me to bring souvenirs.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.147
Unfortunately, we're always
understaffed in this line of business.

00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:49.943
Sorcerers often have to manage tasks
way beyond their capabilities.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:55.281
However, this is an emergency case.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.367
"Fighting is strictly forbidden."

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.911
If you encounter
a Special Grade Cursed Spirit,

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.038
your only choices are to escape or to die.

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.043
Please heed your fears.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:12.799
Don't forget that your mission
is to confirm and rescue any survivors.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.218
Excuse me, about Tadashi…

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.762
You can't do this! Please stand back!

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:18.847
Tadashi…

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.516
Is my son, Tadashi, all right?

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.978
-Calm down, it's dangerous here.
-Let go of me.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.647
-Please stand back!
-She’s one of the victims' guardians.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.691
Please go back.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:33.862
It is suspected that someone
has spread poison within the facility.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:37.448
No further information can be disclosed
for the time being.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:38.950
How could it be?

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.579
Why?

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.541
Why is this happening?

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:50.295
Fushiguro. Kugisaki.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.338
Let's rescue them.

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.965
Of course.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.600
DORM 2

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.729 line:20%
Please be careful.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.608
I'm putting up the Veil.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:38.194
"Emerge from darkness,
that which is darker than black."

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.697
"Purify this impurity."

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.368
What?

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.872
It's turning into nighttime!

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:51.040
That's the Veil.

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:53.293
We're very close
to residential areas this time,

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.920
so it's a barrier to conceal us
from the outside world.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:56.963
This is awesome!

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:58.214
How ignorant.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.717
Divine Dogs.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.474
As soon as the curse approaches,
it will let us know.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.059
Oh, I see!

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:13.563
What a good boy! We'll be counting on you.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:17.942
Let's go.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:22.405
Wait!

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:27.452
What is that?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.163
What's going on?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:33.583
Isn't this supposed to be
a dormitory with two floors?

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.919
Calm down! This is a duplex building!

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.212
<i>No, it's not.</i>

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.674
<i>This is an Innate Domain
created by the curse.</i>

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.510
<i>This is my first time seeing
a domain so huge.</i>

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:46.220
Where's the door?

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.097
-What?
-What?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.058
The door has disappeared!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.352
-Why? Didn't we just enter from there?
-That's right!

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.814
<i>-Oh, no, what should we do?</i>
-It will be fine.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:59.442
This dog can remember
the scent of the entrance.

00:05:59.525 --> 00:06:01.360
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my!

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.571
Good boy! Let me feed you some jerky!

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.990
Give me all the jerkies here!

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.408
Come on! Be serious!

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:10.203
-Fushiguro, you're so reliable!
-What?

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:13.748
With your help, we can save the survivors
as well as ourselves!

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:18.252
Let's move.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:50.910
How terrible…

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.830
I guess it's safe to say
that there are three people.

00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:56.666 line:20%
TADASHI OKAZAKI

00:06:58.417 --> 00:06:59.710
<i>Tadashi…</i>

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.296
<i>Is my son, Tadashi, all right?</i>

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:05.716
I'm taking this body back.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.051
What?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.803
He is that woman's son.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:09.929
But…

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:11.556
His face is still recognizable.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.016
Telling her that he's dead
without showing the body…

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.310
Of course, his mother couldn't accept it.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.441
We have to confirm the status
of the remaining two people,

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.025
so leave that body here.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:26.863
You're kidding!
The path we came from disappeared!

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.739
There's no chance of coming back later!

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:32.368
I'm not saying we're coming back!
I'm saying we're leaving him here!

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.246
I have no intention

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.499
of bringing back a corpse of someone
I never intended to save!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.795
You didn't intend to save them?
What do you mean?

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.797
This is a juvenile detention center.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.551
Jujutsu Sorcerers receives information
on the crime scene in advance.

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:51.304
<i>Tadashi Okazaki…</i>

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.097
<i>He was driving without a license</i>

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.058
<i>and hit a young girl
who was on her way home from school.</i>

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.644
And this is his second offense.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:05.776
You've always wanted to save civilians
and point them to the right death.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.740
But what if the person you saved
takes someone else's life later?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.994
Then why did you save me?

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.957
Stop it already! Jeez!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.169
What are you two doing? Are you fools?

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.005
Consider the time and occasion--

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.634
Kugisaki?

00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:32.887
<i>Impossible! Did the Divine Dog
not detect the scent of the curse?</i>

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.184
-Itadori!
-What?

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:42.271
Run! We'll find Kugisaki later…

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.986
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.905
<i>This is the Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:52.365
<i>I can't move.</i>

00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:53.741
<i>Move!</i>

00:08:53.824 --> 00:08:56.744
<i>Come on, move!</i>

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.330
Save others.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.093
Itadori…

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:15.596
What?

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.687
Goodness. Where am I?

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.273
It's dark and I can't see anything.

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:28.651
<i>I can smell a curse!</i>

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:32.446
<i>What's with the amount of curses?</i>

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.327
Nue!

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:51.966
<i>Please don't die, Itadori and Kugisaki!</i>

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:56.012
There's no escaping anymore
since I'm this close.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.891
Hey, Sukuna. You'll die if I die, right?

00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:02.935
Help me if you don't want that!

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.395
I refuse.

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.897 line:20%
Even if I die in your body,

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.401 line:20%
I still have 18 souls left.

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:16.073
But what makes me angry
is that I can't control this body.

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:20.494
Feel free to swap if you want to, but…

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:24.332 line:20%
Instead of killing the Cursed Spirits,
I'll kill that kid first.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.375
<i>Next, I'll kill that woman.</i>

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.087
<i>She's full of spirit,
so I think I'll have fun with her.</i>

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.465 line:20%
I won't let you do that.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:34.050
Guessed so.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:38.554 line:20%
But if you keep talking to me,
your buddy's going to die.

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.355
<i>It's not using sorcery.</i>

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.400
<i>It's just using cursed energy!</i>

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.156
Fushiguro!

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.492
Fushiguro!

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:02.411
Take Kugisaki out of here.

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:06.040
I'll hold it down until you guys leave.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:09.251
After you're out,
find some way to send me a signal.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.628
After that…

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.631
I'll change to Sukuna.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:15.424
It's impossible for you to win!

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.551
How are you going to fight it
with bare hands?

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.928
Look closely.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.891
He's enjoying it.
He's totally underestimating us.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.685
I can still buy time.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.853
You can't!

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.313
Fushiguro.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:31.941
Please.

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.695
Divine Dogs!

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:41.283
Find Kugisaki!

00:11:44.787 --> 00:11:46.956
This is the last one.

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:52.586
I should have brought a lot more.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:04.849
Is it easier to move around
in just your undergarment?

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.642
<i>But what should I do?</i>

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:09.687
<i>I don't know
how to use cursed energy at all.</i>

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.481
<i>Forget it. The important thing now
is to buy some time--</i>

00:12:18.946 --> 00:12:21.824
<i>What was that?
Some kind of cursed energy barrier?</i>

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.866
<i>This seriously hurts.</i>

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.953
<i>It feels terrible. Why would I…</i>

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:11.749
<i>If I hadn't picked up the finger…</i>

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.168
<i>If I hadn't eaten it…</i>

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.755
<i>Back then…</i>

00:13:17.838 --> 00:13:20.341
<i>Stop! Don't think about it!</i>

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:23.219
<i>No.</i>

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.387
<i>I want to run away.</i>

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:27.681
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:32.311
<i>Even if I die here,</i>

00:13:32.394 --> 00:13:34.730
<i>is it considered a justified death?</i>

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:43.322
Stop thinking about it!

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.242
<i>Save others.</i>

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.203
<i>Was I…</i>

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.122
<i>really this weak?</i>

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:57.878
I remember your faces.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.381
I will curse you!

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:16.105
We're getting out, Kugisaki!

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.899
I hate frogs.

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.109
Well, sorry about that!

00:14:27.908 --> 00:14:29.326
I overestimated myself.

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:32.580
I thought I was strong.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:37.167
I thought I was strong enough
to choose my own death.

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.253
But in reality, I'm not.

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:43.424
I'm too weak!

00:14:44.675 --> 00:14:47.428
I'm just too weak.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:51.432
I don't want to die!

00:14:51.515 --> 00:14:55.185
I don't want to! But…

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:58.272
I still have to die.

00:14:58.939 --> 00:15:02.484
<i>It's not about having a justified death.</i>

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.028
<i>Don't be naive!</i>

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.740
<i>No Jujutsu Sorcerer
can die without remorse.</i>

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:14.038
<i>Even so, you have to convince yourself
that it's justified.</i>

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:18.876
<i>Curses emerge from the negative
emotions of human beings.</i>

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:21.629
<i>If so, I'll use this hatred,</i>

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.465
<i>fear,</i>

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:26.550
<i>and regret.</i>

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.470
<i>I'll release them all…</i>

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:32.556
<i>into this fist of mine!</i>

00:15:44.902 --> 00:15:47.154
Darn it.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:52.409
<i>That howl…</i>

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.792
<i>Was that Fushiguro's signal?</i>

00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:10.803
This brat is really getting on my nerves.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.393
This brat is really getting on my nerves.

00:16:17.476 --> 00:16:20.854
He's totally looking down on me.

00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:25.818
Wait a minute. Let me think about it.

00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:29.738
I need to figure out a way
to make him regret it.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.074
<i>Right.</i>

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.575
<i>If I go after the other kid,</i>

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.328
<i>he'll switch back
right before I get to him.</i>

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:42.543
<i>That means "this" should
put him in a tough spot.</i>

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:44.753
<i>I'll put you guys back to where you were.</i>

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:48.132
Hey. Let's go take down the kids.

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:50.009
Follow me.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:16:58.934
You fool.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.986
Oh, no. I helped him heal his hand.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:12.698
You don't want to go for a walk?

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:17.244
Well, Cursed Spirits usually
only loiter around their birthplaces.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.663
That's all good. If that's the case…

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:23.709
Die here!

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:27.588
Hey, what's wrong?

00:17:28.172 --> 00:17:30.257
This is not all you're capable of, right?

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:36.805
That's right. Come on, you can do it!

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:42.561
What?

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.399
You might be a Cursed Spirit,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.277
but you still miss your limb?

00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.588
Please extend the evacuation zone
to ten kilometers.

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:10.964
What will you do, Fushiguro?

00:18:11.548 --> 00:18:14.259
I'll be here waiting
for Itadori to come back.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:15.594
I see.

00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:18.931
I'll send Kugisaki to the hospital,

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:21.183
and return here as soon as possible.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.392
It's fine.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:24.812
It's not like
you can do anything, Mr. Ijichi.

00:18:25.687 --> 00:18:30.609
If possible, please assign
a Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer over here.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.986
Although, I don't think there's any.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.321
I'll try my best.

00:18:34.404 --> 00:18:35.614
I'm leaving.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:46.917
<i>If something happens to him…</i>

00:18:48.043 --> 00:18:49.670
I don't want him to die.

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:52.256
It is personal.
Please do something about this.

00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:57.094
<i>…I am obligated to deal with him.</i>

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.099
Hey, did you know?

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:07.104
We're classified as
Special Grade Curse Spirits.

00:19:07.187 --> 00:19:10.274
Both you and I, I mean.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.830
Nice going, Special Grade Curse!

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:26.290
Keep it up.

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.546
You look happy.

00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:34.173 line:20%
Shall I compliment you?

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:38.218
But unlike humans,
it's not difficult for Cursed Spirits

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:41.680
to regenerate with cursed energy.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.685
<i>You and this brat…</i>

00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:52.566
You guys really don't understand
anything about curses.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.611
This is a good opportunity.
Let me teach you…

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.864
what real sorcery is.

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:02.784
Domain Expansion.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:13.420
Malevolent Shrine.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:22.804
I wanted to cut you into three pieces.

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:25.015
I guess you're really weak.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:29.144
Oh, yes, there's this too.

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.563
I'm taking this with me.

00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.991
It's over.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:47.829
This is pissing me off.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:50.249
Just come out now
if you're going to switch places.

00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:56.171
What's wrong, brat?

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:38.398
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:40.901
Yes, I understand.

00:22:40.984 --> 00:22:43.403
Please take care of it. Yes.

00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.781
-Stare…
-Stare…

00:22:46.406 --> 00:22:47.407
What's wrong?

00:22:47.491 --> 00:22:49.910
So you bow
while talking on the phone, Mr. Ijichi.

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:56.083
When I'm about to make a call,
I'll adjust my mood accordingly

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.918
to make it an immersive experience.

00:22:58.001 --> 00:22:59.086
I can understand that.

00:22:59.169 --> 00:23:00.962
I've hurt my neck several times

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:04.049
while trying to remove ingrown hair
during depilation.

00:23:04.132 --> 00:23:06.301
Of course, my pores were hurt too.

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:07.928
Is that the same thing?

00:23:08.011 --> 00:23:11.556
Fushiguro gets agitated on the phone too.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.559
That's not about the phone call,
that's because it's Mr. Gojo.

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:18.188 line:20%
Itadori likes to walk around
while he's on the phone.

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.606
Speaking of phone calls,

00:23:19.689 --> 00:23:21.900
can you guys sandwich
your phone on your shoulder

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:23.693
while making a call?
