WEBVTT

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.880
According to the sorcery law,
Yuji Itadori,

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:08.883
as a Cursed Spirit, you will be exorcised!

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.762
Wait! There's nothing wrong with me!

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.473
More importantly,
both of us are pretty beat up.

00:00:15.557 --> 00:00:16.850
Let's go to the hospital.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.896
<i>I can't tell whether Itadori
or the Cursed Spirit is talking now.</i>

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.315
<i>Darn! What should I do?</i>

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.401
What's going on?

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.318
What?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:29.779
Mr. Gojo! Why are you here?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.739
Hey there.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.158
I wasn't planning on coming.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.243
Oh, my. You're all roughed up.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.371
I'm going to show it
to the second-year students.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:39.998
Look over here.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:41.916
The higher-ups wouldn't stop nagging

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.294
about the loss of a Special Grade Curse.

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:47.172
I just popped by real quick
after some sightseeing.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.965
So did you find it?

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.926
-Excuse me.
-What?

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.929
Sorry, but I ate it.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:57.932
Are you serious?

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:58.933
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:00.935
What?

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.314
What?

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.691
I see.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.572
Really, it's combined with you.
That's hilarious.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.449
Is there anything wrong with your body?

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:15.784
Not really.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.535
Can you switch with Sukuna?

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.620
Sukuna?

00:01:18.703 --> 00:01:20.413
The Cursed Spirit you ate.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.625
Well, I guess so.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:25.835
All right, give us ten seconds.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.129
Come back to us after ten seconds.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.631
But…

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:33.343
Don't worry. I'm invincible.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:34.636
Megumi.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.095
Hold on to this.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.305
What's this?

00:01:37.388 --> 00:01:39.098
It's <i>kikufuku </i>from Kikusuian.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.309
<i>It's a Sendai delicacy.</i>

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.770
<i>I especially recommend
the bean whipped cream!</i>

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.980
<i>I can't believe he went shopping
for souvenirs</i>

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:47.607
<i>at a time when lives are at stake!</i>

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.067
It's not a souvenir.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.821
I'm going to eat it on the way back home
while I'm on the bullet train.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:53.905
Behind you!

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.074
<i>Kikufuku</i> is different
from other souvenirs.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.746
What?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.587
Besides, the whipped cream
inside is exquisite.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.220
My student is here,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.888
so let me show off a little.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.688
<i>He's very fast? Wait.</i>

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.987
For god's sake…

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.241
No matter which era,
Jujutsu Sorcerers are a pain in the ass!

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.920
But that doesn't mean much to me.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:55.508
Seven, eight, nine.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.260
It's almost done.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.640
<i>Darn it. I can't possess him again.</i>

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:09.981
<i>Who the heck is this Itadori kid?</i>

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.567
Are you okay?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.152
I can't believe it.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.279
You can really control it.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:20.199
But it's so annoying,
I can hear his voice.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.244
And it's a miracle he's only doing that.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.629
What did you do?

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.714
I put him to sleep.

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:39.761
If he isn't possessed by Sukuna
when he wakes up,

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:41.971
then he could be a vessel.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.515
All right, here's a question!

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.434
What should we do with him?

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.231
Even if he's a vessel,

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:54.442
according to the sorcery law,
Itadori is subjected to death.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:55.944
But…

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:58.696
I don't want him to die.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.990
Are those your personal feelings?

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.993
It is personal.
Please do something about this.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.664
Since my precious student is asking,

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:09.624
leave it to me!

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.126
<i>So let me repeat myself.</i>

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.337
You're going to be executed.

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.508
The memories
and current events don't match.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:20.551
Don't get me wrong. I tried my best.

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:24.013
It's the same death sentence,
but I got your sentence suspended.

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:27.934
Suspended? I guess it means
I won't be executed immediately.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:31.145
Yes, I'll explain it from the beginning.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.524
This is the same
as the cursed object you ate.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.234
There are 20 of them in total,

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.903
and 6 of them are in our hands.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.739
Twenty? So that includes
his hands and legs?

00:04:41.823 --> 00:04:45.785
No, Sukuna has four hands.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.210
As you can see, it can't be destroyed.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.379
That's how powerful this curse is.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.048
The curse is getting stronger every day.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:02.302
The existing Jujutsu Sorcerers
and their seals can't keep up.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.429
-That's where you come in.
-What?

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.057
<i>As long as you die,
the curse inside you will die too.</i>

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.602
<i>Our elders are very timid,</i>

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.188
<i>and they are demanding
that they want you killed now.</i>

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.567
But won't that be a waste?

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.901
A waste?

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:23.573
We may not find another vessel
that can withstand Sukuna's curse.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.867
So I gave them a suggestion.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:32.081
<i>Since you have to die, why don't
we let you absorb all of Sukuna first?</i>

00:05:32.957 --> 00:05:34.709
The higher-ups agreed.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:38.254
You have two choices now.

00:05:38.337 --> 00:05:40.214
Either you die now,

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:45.178
or die after finding
and absorbing all of Sukuna's parts.

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:18.396
SUGISAWA HOSPITAL

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.904
Itadori.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.118
How's Iguchi doing?

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:40.501
The doctor said he's fine,
but he hasn't regained consciousness yet.

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:43.296
It's my fault.

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.508
It's all because I asked him
to go to the school at night.

00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:52.388
You probably won't believe me,

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:55.975
but there were strange
monsters attacking us.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.644
I got caught too.

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.271
I believe you.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:02.940
They were not monsters,
but Cursed Spirits.

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:05.902
What?

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.988
That finger is called
a Special Grade Cursed Relic.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.366
It's capable of attracting other
Cursed Spirits and making them stronger.

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:15.411
So the both of you did nothing wrong.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.664
It's my fault since I picked it up.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.337
I'm sorry. But it will be fine.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:27.924
The person who can cure
Iguchi will be here tomorrow.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:30.051
Itadori…

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:31.886
I'm sorry, Sasaki.

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.013
I need to go somewhere else.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.734 line:20%
STOP

00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.236 line:20%
Who passed away?

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:51.280 line:20%
My grandpa, but he's like a father to me.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.326 line:20%
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
We came at a bad time.

00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:00.039 line:20%
So have you made your decision?

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:05.545
Is it common to have
casualties from curses?

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:09.298
This is a very special case.

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:12.218
But it's not rare
to see curses bring damage.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.721
It’s lucky for someone to die
a normal death after encountering a curse.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:23.729
<i>It's also lucky to find bodies
that have been torn apart.</i>

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:34.115
You will witness terrible scenes
while searching for Sukuna.

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:38.244
I can't guarantee you won't
end up that way yourself, either.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:41.872
Well, pick your poison.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.759
<i>You're strong enough to save others.</i>

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:03.102
When all parts of Sukuna have disappeared,

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:05.396
will there be fewer people…

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.233
suffering from curses?

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.194
Of course.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.413
Do you still have that finger?

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:30.546
Now that I look at it,
it's actually disgusting.

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:41.682
<i>This is the second one, so one-tenth.</i>

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.434
<i>What will happen?</i>

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:52.818
SECULAR NAME

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.541
It tastes so awful that it's funny.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.794
<i>I'm sure now.</i>

00:11:09.877 --> 00:11:11.671
<i>It's not just physical endurance,</i>

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.340
<i>he can even maintain his consciousness
when facing Sukuna.</i>

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.593
<i>He's a once-in-a-millennium genius.</i>

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:19.345
What's wrong?

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:21.430
Oh, nothing.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:25.518
Can I assume that you're ready for this?

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.354
Not at all.

00:11:28.437 --> 00:11:31.524
I'm still thinking about
why I'm going to be executed.

00:11:31.607 --> 00:11:34.777
But I just can't ignore the curses.

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:38.614
That last request is so troublesome.

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:42.618
I'll eat every part of Sukuna.

00:11:42.701 --> 00:11:44.286
I don't care what happens after.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:48.124
I'm destined to die, right?

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:51.836
Good. I don't dislike people like you.

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:54.338
Looks like a fun hell is waiting for you.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:56.882
Pack up your stuff today.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.384
Where are we going?

00:11:58.884 --> 00:11:59.760
Tokyo.

00:11:59.844 --> 00:12:02.138
Fushiguro! You look great!

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.973
You think so after seeing this?

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:08.644
You'll be transferring
to the Jujutsu Sorcerers' school I attend.

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:09.895
What?

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:14.400
<i>Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School.</i>

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:15.943
By the way…

00:12:16.026 --> 00:12:18.112
You're the third first-year student.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:19.488
There are very few students!

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:31.375
I'm leaving, Grandpa.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:34.003
ITADORI FAMILY GRAVE

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:39.341
It's deep in the mountains.
Is this really Tokyo?

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.844
Even the outskirts of Tokyo
look like this.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.220
Where's Fushiguro?

00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.848
<i>He just got his wounds treated
by a Jujutsu Sorcerer,</i>

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.141
<i>so he's in deep sleep now.</i>

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.645
<i>Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School.</i>

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:55.649
<i>It's one of the two sorcery
educational institutions in Japan.</i>

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:59.195
<i>On the surface,
it's known as a private religious school.</i>

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:05.159
<i>Many Jujutsu Sorcerers use this place
as a base after graduation.</i>

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:08.621
It's not just about education,
but mediation and support in missions too.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:10.706
It's a cornerstone
in the world of sorcery.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:15.544
Anyway, you'll be having an interview
with the principal later.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.004
The principal?

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:20.591
Your admission will be denied
if you screw up, so do your best.

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:21.675
What?

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:24.053
If so, will I be executed immediately?

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:27.932
What? Aren't you the chief?

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.728
Any hierarchy
other than strength is boring.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.482
Sorry, Mr. Gojo. He appears sometimes.

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:39.235
Your body has gotten interesting.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.820
-I still owe you a favor.
-Hey, not again!

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:46.200
Once I take over this kid's body,
I'll kill you first.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.703
It's an honor to be targeted by Sukuna.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:52.122
Is he famous?

00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:53.999
Ryomen Sukuna.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:58.003
He's a fictional supernatural being
with four hands and two faces.

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:00.839
But he's a real human being that existed.

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.300
It's just that it was
over a thousand years ago.

00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:06.136
When sorcery once flourished,

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.639
<i>Jujutsu Sorcerers
gathered to challenge him</i>

00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:10.182
<i>but they failed miserably.</i>

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:15.271
<i>He's known as Ryomen Sukuna,
and we couldn't even destroy his grave wax</i>

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.856
<i>that was handed down
after his death as cursed objects.</i>

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.818
<i>Without a doubt, he's the king of curses.</i>

00:14:22.152 --> 00:14:23.946
Who's stronger, him or you?

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.073
Well…

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:30.327
If Sukuna gains back all his power,
it's a bit hard to deal with him.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:31.912
Will you lose?

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.248
I'll win.

00:14:42.339 --> 00:14:44.300
-You're late, Satoru!
-What?

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.302
You're eight minutes late.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:49.555
Not enough to chastise you for,

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:53.267
but I remember telling you
to fix your tardiness.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.437
<i>There's an old man making cute dolls!</i>

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.857
If it's not enough to chastise me for,
then please don't do so.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.069
You're just making dolls, anyway.
Can't you wait for eight minutes?

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:06.655
He is the principal, Mr. Masamichi Yaga.

00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:08.866
Is that him?

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:10.534
My name is Yuji Itadori!

00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.661
I'm into girls like Jennifer Lawrence.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.580
-Pleased to meet you!
-Why are you here?

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:17.917
For the interview.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.002
I'm asking why
you're in Jujutsu High School.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.504
To learn about curses?

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.214
I mean after that.

00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:28.052
After learning about curses
and having the power to exorcise them,

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:30.679
what are you going to do?

00:15:31.221 --> 00:15:32.973
"What," you ask…

00:15:34.016 --> 00:15:36.310
I want to take back Sukuna's fingers.

00:15:36.393 --> 00:15:38.312
It would be dangerous to just leave them.

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:39.563
Why?

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.400
Crimes, accidents, and diseases.

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:48.030
It's natural to hear
people you don't know die every day.

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:49.657
It's beginning.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.994
So if it's curse-related,
you find the need to intervene?

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:56.330
It's someone's last request.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.499
Who cares about the details?

00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:00.501
I just want to save people.

00:16:00.584 --> 00:16:02.461
Last request?

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:07.716
So you're going to fight curses
just because people told you to?

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:10.219
You fail!

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:18.602
That's not a doll?

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:21.480
It's a Cursed Corpse. They are dolls…

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:24.608
with my curse in them!

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.573
<i>What a heavy punch!</i>

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.245
Is that really a doll?

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:41.041
Human nature surfaces
during desperate situations.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.629
I'll keep attacking you
until I hear the answers I want.

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:49.508
In the first place,
it wasn't just anyone's last request.

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.970
It came from my family member!

00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:03.439
Darn, where is it?

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:10.279
Oh, god.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:13.032
Even family members
are considered as "someone else."

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:23.542
<i>Right, it's a doll.
It doesn't get hurt or scared.</i>

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:26.503
A Jujutsu Sorcerer
is always dealing with death.

00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.213
Not just your own death.

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.216
There are times where you have
to tear apart the flesh of a curse

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.969
while the dead
are barely out of your field of vision.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.388
It's an unpleasant job.

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:40.893
It requires some insanity
and high motivation.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:43.353
And you’re doing it
because someone else told you to?

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.772
What a joke!

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:49.068
I could have understood if you told me
you wanted to delay your death sentence.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.403
-Are you kidding me? I--
-Let me ask you.

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.822
If you're killed by a curse,

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.200 line:20%
are you going to blame it on your grandpa?

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:00.120
You…

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.581
Your words are so harsh.

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:05.084
Education is about poking where it hurts.

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.420
I don't think…

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:19.765
I can't tell what you're thinking of
when you're on the brink of death.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.102
But I'm sure of this.

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:27.981
If this continues, you might end up
cursing your beloved grandpa later.

00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:31.235
No Jujutsu Sorcerer
can die without remorse.

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:33.487
Let me ask you again,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.533
why did you come to Jujutsu High School?

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.913
<i>Ever since I was a kid,
I've been good at sports and fighting.</i>

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:48.335
<i>But I never felt like
I was the only one who could do that.</i>

00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:58.137
I'm the only one who can consume Sukuna.

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.472
Even if I can avoid my death sentence…

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.599
If I run away from my duty,

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:07.354
<i>I'll eat, take a bath, and read comics.</i>

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.774
<i>But when I space out…</i>

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:17.364
<i>I'll get depressed thinking that
someone's dead now because of Sukuna.</i>

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:20.826
<i>Am I supposed to convince myself
that it doesn't concern me</i>

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:23.078
<i>and that it's not my fault?</i>

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.457
I'm not doing that!

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.711
I don't know what will happen when I die,

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:33.297 line:20%
but I don't want
to regret the way I lived.

00:19:36.592 --> 00:19:39.720
Satoru, take him to the dorm.

00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:43.056
Also, explain the various
security measures to him.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.224
What?

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.019
You've passed.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.188
Welcome to Jujutsu High School.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:57.821
I'm sorry. I forgot to dispel it.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:02.326
Wow! It's so spacious!

00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.494
The second
and third-year students are out now.

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:07.164
-Hello! Is anyone here?
-But I'm sure we'll see each other.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:08.874
There are not many people anyway.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:12.502
But you don't have to fight, you know?

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.297
Fushiguro and I
will find the fingers of Sukuna.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.674
You just need to wait here.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.927
No. I promised, so I'll do it.

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.013
<i>But it will be funny if I laze around…</i>

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.765
Good work.

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:28.852
<i>…while waiting for Fushiguro to give me
the fingers while he's beaten up.</i>

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.312
<i>You're right.</i>

00:20:30.812 --> 00:20:35.150
But, well, there's no way
you're not getting into fights.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.319
Hey! Were you testing me?

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:43.325
If it was that easy,
we would have found them all by now.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:50.332
<i>Some have strong auras, some are quiet,
and some are possessed by spirits.</i>

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:55.587
It's going to be a real pain in the ass
to find them.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.714
But we have you now.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:00.717
The Sukuna in you
will tell us where they are

00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:03.136
since he wants to regain his powers.

00:21:03.804 --> 00:21:06.306
<i>You're both a vessel and a detector,</i>

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.100
<i>and that makes you a radar.</i>

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:11.186
So it's not going to work
if you're not in the field with us.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.897
Do you think he's such a nice guy?

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:17.567
I think it's possible to build
a win-win relationship with him.

00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.946
-You're next door.
-Fushiguro!

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:23.031
You definitely look much better this time.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.284
There are plenty of empty rooms.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:27.703
Isn't it better
when the place is more lively?

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:30.622
-I think it's good--
-Just classes and missions are sufficient.

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.665
What a pain…

00:21:31.748 --> 00:21:34.501
Oh, wow! Your room looks really tidy!

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:38.130
-Like I said, you're a bother!
-Oh, god!

00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:40.299
But isn't this fine?

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.592
Anyway, we're going out tomorrow!

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:46.596
We'll be meeting
the third first-year student.

00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:55.897
<i>The train to Tokyo has arrived.
Please stand behind the yellow line.</i>

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:01.695
It took four hours just to reach Morioka.

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:04.865
It's finally time to say goodbye
to the boonies!

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:10.537
I'll reach Tokyo this afternoon.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.664
What if I get discovered
by a talent scout?

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:14.875
By Stardust Promotion, maybe.
