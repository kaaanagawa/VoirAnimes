00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.248 line:20%
I got you!

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.548
<i>What?</i>

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.051
<i>What's in the blood that he vomited?</i>

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.054
<i>Toxin?</i>

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.391 line:20%
What is this? You're strong.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.477
It's not fun at all.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:05.482
Straw Doll Technique…

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.025
Resonance!

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:27.712
Just how many are there?

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.299
We should treat it
like a game of whack-a-mole.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:35.553
Yes, just continue to exorcise it.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.722
Don't leave any behind.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.141
The opponent probably won't retaliate.

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.729
There are restrictions, but the wider
the range of the cursed technique,

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.482
the weaker the user's attack ability?

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.984
It's just hypothetical.

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.613
<i>I was worried about the range
of the cursed technique,</i>

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.032
<i>the number of victims, and the barrier.</i>

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.160
<i>All of these will affect the user
in a subtractive way.</i>

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.703
<i>We're lucky.</i>

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.706
<i>We should be able to exorcise it quickly.</i>

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.711 line:20%
<i>In that case, what comes after
might be the real threat.</i>

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.304
Kugisaki!

00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:20.306
I'm fine.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.560
You continue on with the whack-a-mole.

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:27.605 line:20%
Darn it!

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.816 line:20%
Why is she always being taken away?

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.110
<i>What was that anyway?</i>

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.739
<i>Was it a mole, or that thing?</i>

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:38.950
<i>It's neither of them!</i>

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.244
Kugisaki?

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.330
-What? Is it my older brother?
-What?

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.834
-Hey!
-Let me join in!

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:49.711
What?

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.714
It ran away?

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.717
-Should I leave it?
-Hurry up! Chase after it!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.721
Kugisaki and that guy left the barrier.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:03.725
She might run into someone
more troublesome than expected.

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.144
On the contrary,
it's a lot easier over here.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:07.729
I can handle it by myself.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:10.231 line:20%
Prioritize Kugisaki. Hurry!

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.775
If the situation worsens,

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.737
you have to come out too.

00:03:24.662 --> 00:03:26.915
Darn it! Don't touch me!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.173
I see. It's a girl.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.341
Oh, my.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.593
I apologize.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:44.307
-Gross!
-Both of our errand…

00:03:45.683 --> 00:03:50.146
doesn't include killing sorcerers.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.608
If you retreat, I will spare your life…

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.611
Young lady.

00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.112
Errand?

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.405
What?

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.116
I thought we're both here
for the same reason.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:06.162 line:20%
<i>Is he a Cursed Spirit, or a Curse User?</i>

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.122 line:20%
<i>Speaking of which, what is this scent?</i>

00:04:22.637 --> 00:04:24.013
The last one!

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.435
The way to go around
behind them is too simple.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.440
I told you,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:36.192
it's too simple.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.784
Did I exorcise all of them?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.746 line:20%
<i>I don't have to worry
about Tsumiki for now.</i>

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.207
<i>What's left is…</i>

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:01.968
<i>It's still alive?</i>

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.971
<i>That wasn't the main body?</i>

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.016
<i>The barrier is still active.
What's going on?</i>

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:16.774
<i>Never assume that a Cursed Spirit
has a logical modus operandi.</i>

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.695
<i>Even so, there's something
that I don't understand.</i>

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:27.994
<i>Why didn't it start to kill
the marked humans until recently?</i>

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.748
<i>The first cursed death victim
was killed in June.</i>

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:34.459 line:20%
<i>June?</i>

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.966 line:20%
<i>Our goal is to…</i>

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.428
recover Sukuna's finger.

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.733 line:20%
<i>Things that have an immense presence…</i>

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.111 line:20%
<i>Things that are hiding…</i>

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.281 line:20%
<i>Things that have been
absorbed by Cursed Spirits…</i>

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.242
<i>They are all resonating.</i>

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.454
<i>After being swallowed
by the Cursed Spirit,</i>

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.165
<i>the power of Sukuna's finger,
which was suppressed…</i>

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:42.670
<i>Its cursed energy was released
after obtaining Itadori's vessel in June.</i>

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:46.799
<i>Although they look the same,</i>

00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:50.761
<i>compared to the one
at the detention center…</i>

00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.394
<i>It's much stronger!</i>

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:09.655
Nue.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:18.122
All right, I won again this time.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.250
This is rare.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:23.836
I'm surprised you want me
to train with you.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.714
Are you feeling anxious
because of Yuji's growth?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.676
Well, you can't solve anything
without making sacrifices.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.222
You despise my help so much?

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:41.187
Megumi, I believe your strength
and potential are not weaker than Yuji.

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.649
It's just that your mental aspect
is holding you back.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:49.028 line:20%
Megumi, you don't know
how to bring out your best, right?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.239 line:20%
What?

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:54.283
Are you saying that I'm not doing my best?

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.411
No, I mean you don't know
how to try your best.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:09:00.248
For example during the baseball game,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.708
<i>why did you make a sacrifice bunt?</i>

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:10.883
You wanted Nobara to enter the base,
even though you'll get tagged out?

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.135
How admirable.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.557
<i>But if it's me or Yuji,
we will aim for a home run at any time.</i>

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:22.520
I'm not saying that a bunt is not good.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:26.941
As baseball is a team sport,
everyone has their own task.

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:30.236
But being a Jujutsu Sorcerer
is an individual job.

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.030
It's important to work
with other Jujutsu Sorcerers, too.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.574
You're right.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:37.868
But no matter how many allies you have,

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.080 line:20%
you always die alone.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:46.168
You're only trying to judge
and match those around you

00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:50.965
instead of picturing
a stronger future version of yourself.

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.968
Is it because you have
an ace up your sleeve?

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:58.389
You think that at worst,
everything will be solved after you die.

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:03.894
Forget about me,
you won't even reach Nanami's level.

00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:08.149
To die and then win,
and to die victoriously…

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.072
They are two completely
different things, Megumi.

00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:20.036
<i>Give it your all, and be more greedy.</i>

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:31.881
<i>How long have I been unconscious?</i>

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.759
<i>Was Divine Dog destroyed?</i>

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.011
<i>No, was my cursed technique dispelled?</i>

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.602
<i>I guess this is the end for me.</i>

00:10:47.104 --> 00:10:51.025 line:20%
Furube, yurayura…

00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.116
It's a waste of your talent.

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:04.205
Forget it.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:11.253
<i>A Jujutsu Sorcerer's growth
never comes easy.</i>

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.173
Back then…

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.008
<i>Why did you escape?</i>

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:20.346
Bring out the full potential
of the shadow.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.974
Don't think about the specifics for now.

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:28.479
Release it while coagulating
your cursed energy.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.527
Imagine a future version of myself
that has surpassed my limits!

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:36.404
I'll show it to you!

00:11:36.987 --> 00:11:38.364
<i>With a firm base,</i>

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.283
<i>good sense, and imagination,</i>

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:45.204
<i>humans can change
with the slightest of events.</i>

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.332 line:20%
Domain Expansion.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:56.298
Chimera Shadow Garden.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:03.180
<i>Although it's incomplete and ugly,</i>

00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:05.975
<i>it's enough for now!</i>

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.201 line:20%
<i>Be free…</i>

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.163 line:20%
<i>to expand!</i>

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:32.293
<i>Expand the interpretation of…</i>

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.338
<i>the cursed technique!</i>

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:05.743
<i>Divine Dog's claws
were capable of harming that guy.</i>

00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:12.416
<i>Of course,
it can penetrate you if you relax.</i>

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:25.930
I'm so tired.

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.520
Where are the two of them?

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.191
Great.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.693
This is great.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:58.712
Do you know the basis

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.131
for human interaction?

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.758
I don't.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:09.723
"I won't kill you,
so please don't kill me either."

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:12.601
You can replace the word "kill"
with something else.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:16.355
In short, never cross any line
that violates someone else's dignity.

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:20.401
Through this process,
mutual existence is realized.

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:24.989
Breaking that rule, or acting arrogant
thinking that you have no need for it…

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:28.325 line:20%
You must feel great.

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:33.080
If you do that to me again,
I'm going to kill you.

00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:36.041
What have we done to you?

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:39.545
Use your brain.
Or else, you can go and die.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:40.546
Hey!

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:45.050
I must make it clear
to Ikezawa and the gang today.

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:48.095
I'm not their errand boy.

00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:49.889
All the best, Aida.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.058 line:20%
But I may be the next target.

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:55.311 line:20%
Please don't do your best, Aida.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.021
Hey, you fatty!

00:14:57.104 --> 00:14:58.564
I will change my line.

00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:01.817
I'll ask them to make you
run errands from today!

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:03.777
Are you going to betray your friend?

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.029
Shut up!

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:06.655
Megumi.

00:15:10.534 --> 00:15:13.954
Wait. Isn't that Ikezawa
and the rest lying over there?

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.041
Didn't you promise not to fight again?

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.960
Stop acting like my guardian.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:23.464
<i>I hate bad guys.</i>

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.720
<i>They use poor imagination and sensibility</i>

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.097 line:20%
<i>to live a good life for themselves.</i>

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.808
<i>I'm not good at dealing with kind people.</i>

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.895
<i>They forgive those bad guys…</i>

00:15:39.313 --> 00:15:41.941
<i>to make themselves seem virtuous.</i>

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:45.903
<i>It makes me sick.</i>

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.406
<i>Tsumiki is the typical kind person.</i>

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:52.493
It's gross.

00:15:56.705 --> 00:16:00.125
Sorry, I didn't expect it to spill.

00:16:01.585 --> 00:16:03.212
<i>When I was in first grade,</i>

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.674
<i>my father and Tsumiki's mother,</i>

00:16:07.174 --> 00:16:09.802
<i>our only family members,
fell in love with each other.</i>

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.137
<i>And then they went missing.</i>

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.100
<i>A white-haired stranger said this.</i>

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:22.064
Your father came from the Zenin family,
a well-known sorcerer clan.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.900
But he's a bad guy,
even I don't want to go near him.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:27.653
You're born after he ran away from home.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:29.780
Megumi.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.325
You're your father's
biggest bargaining chip

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.494
to go against the Zenin family.

00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.705
Are you mad?

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.583
<i>I solved the mystery
behind the missing money.</i>

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.712
<i>It seems that I was sold
to that Zenin family.</i>

00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.297
<i>-Yes, I'm mad.</i>
-What?

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:49.967
<i>-Especially at your insensible attitude.</i>
-What?

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:55.097
<i>He was the one who helped
to solve the issue with the Zenin family.</i>

00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:58.934
<i>I was to work as a Jujutsu Sorcerer
in the future as a guarantee,</i>

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:03.605 line:20%
<i>in exchange for monetary support
from the school.</i>

00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:08.235
<i>What's the deal with Jujutsu Sorcerers?</i>

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:09.611
<i>How stupid.</i>

00:17:09.695 --> 00:17:12.281
<i>Who do you want me to help?</i>

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.492
Tsumiki, what are you doing?

00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:17.286
Hello, Megumi!

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.495
Nothing.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:23.292
Wait. Have you made up your mind
about the bravery test?

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.128
I don't want to go but I'm worried,
so I'll come along.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.008
<i>Tsumiki was cursed right after
I reached third year in middle school.</i>

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:34.219
<i>The origin and identity
of the curse were unknown.</i>

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:37.056
<i>There were others who got cursed
similarly across the nation.</i>

00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:41.435
<i>The only thing we know
is that we know nothing.</i>

00:17:41.518 --> 00:17:43.520
<i>Tsumiki has been unconscious
since that day.</i>

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:47.107
If I have the ability to curse someone,

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:49.568
I would rather think about those
who are dear to me.

00:17:50.235 --> 00:17:52.571
<i>She always smiles and patronizes others.</i>

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:56.325
Being unable to forgive people
is not a bad thing.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.494
That's part of your gentleness.
Right, Megumi?

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:01.872
<i>She even acknowledged my nature.</i>

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:05.167
<i>Even if Tsumiki is such a person,</i>

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.961
<i>she still gets angry when I hurt someone.</i>

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.964
<i>I used to think that she's annoying.</i>

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:14.343
<i>I thought she's just a hypocrite.</i>

00:18:15.886 --> 00:18:19.598
<i>But now, I realize that I was wrong.</i>

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.185
<i>Just like how I choose who to help,</i>

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:26.271
<i>she was choosing to worry about me.</i>

00:18:26.939 --> 00:18:30.109
<i>I'm sorry, I was too naive.</i>

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:31.860
<i>I will apologize.</i>

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.365
<i>Wake up, my stupid sister.</i>

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:40.953
Darn it. My head hurts so much.

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:45.624
<i>The Yasohachi Bridge curse
is just on top of the bridge.</i>

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.045
<i>It didn't lift the curse
that made her unconscious, right?</i>

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:57.177
What's left is to let Itadori know
about this finger…

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.891 line:20%
FUSHIGURO FELL ASLEEP

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:07.896
<i>A strong presence appeared suddenly.</i>

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.983
<i>Did Sukuna's finger leave the barrier?</i>

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:15.445
<i>If the one who eliminates
the vessel is a Jujutsu Sorcerer,</i>

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:17.906
<i>then they are quite good.</i>

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.450
<i>Even if they defeated the finger</i>

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:23.495
<i>or the Special Grade Cursed Spirit,</i>

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.373 line:20%
<i>they couldn't have won unscathed.</i>

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:28.458 line:20%
<i>Are they all right?</i>

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:35.507
I slipped up. Please forget what I said.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.967
Stop right there!

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.970
<i>Is he going to get the finger?</i>

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:43.015
How dare you escape
with such a scornful method?

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.517
Do you think you can
get rid of me like this?

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:50.939
I feel inferior about my back,
so I'm warning you.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:52.482
If you look at my back,

00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:53.942
-I'm going to kill--
-What?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:55.444
Kugisaki.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.945
Oh, it's my older brother.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.448
You…

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:04.578
You saw it, didn't you?

00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:08.332 line:20%
-Who is this? I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry, brother! I didn't mean to!

00:20:08.415 --> 00:20:11.752
I'm going to kill you!

00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:18.717
Then why do you dress like this?

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.802
So that's where
the strange smell came from.

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:23.013 line:20%
Otherwise, it will feel stuffy.

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:26.892
Rot Technique, Maximum…

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:30.979
Wing King!

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:35.859
I'm going to kill you.

00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:07.951
<i>-Juju Stroll.
-Juju Stroll.</i>

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.708
Mr. Gojo! Kugisaki!

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:17.252
Shut up.

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.838
It's so hot right now, I can't move.

00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:21.965
A girl approached Fushiguro!

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:25.052 line:20%
Formation B!

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:26.136 line:20%
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:30.474
-Fushiguro!
-Fushiguro!

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:32.225
Who is that girl?

00:22:32.309 --> 00:22:34.603
Did you forget the night
we drank together?

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:36.813
You said you're happiest
when you're with me.

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:38.774
-Is it a lie?
-You didn't forget, did you?

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:42.486
-Remember!
-Seriously, what's wrong with you guys?

00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:47.240
Please don't touch him casually,
you sly cats!

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:53.163
Megumi is going to practice violin
with me later.

00:22:54.081 --> 00:22:55.916
Let's go back, Megumi.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.920
Today, you must master
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:03.048
It's okay. Don't mind them.
Please go ahead.

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:04.800
The station is just right ahead.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:06.301
Thank you.

00:23:06.384 --> 00:23:07.302
-What?
-What?

00:23:07.844 --> 00:23:10.138
So what were you guys up to?

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:13.058
Can you not humiliate me?

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:17.813
Explain it to me!

00:23:19.981 --> 00:23:20.816
It hurts!
