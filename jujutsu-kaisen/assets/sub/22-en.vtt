00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.753
<i>Hey, are you listening?</i>

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.383
I told you,
the auto-lock door is not functioning!

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.468
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.388
I told you last week.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:17.600
Why do you think
I pay such a high management fee?

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.977
What?

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.396
Stop messing with me.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:23.398
Come over and check right now!

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.651
Do you hear me?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.361
I'm going to kill you!

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.416
<i>June in Morioka, Taichi Kanada.</i>

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:09.546
<i>August in Yokohama, Osamu Shimada.</i>

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.550
<i>September in Nagoya, Hiroshi Yamato.</i>

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:17.637
<i>Their cause of death is the same.</i>

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:22.934
<i>They were killed by a Cursed Spirit
at their apartment entrance.</i>

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.271 line:20%
And they complained about the same thing

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:29.107
to the management
weeks before their death.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:33.153 line:20%
"The auto-lock door is not functioning."

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.949 line:20%
But the other residents
did not have the same problem.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.743
The dates and locations are different.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.829
Could this be done
by the same Cursed Spirit?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:44.414
Hey.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:46.916
Is the Cursed Spirit related
to the auto-lock doors?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.586
Can Cursed Spirits
get caught by the door sensor?

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.921
I remember that
they are invisible on camera.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.007
It's not the sensor.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.428
It seems like the door operator system
was affected by the Cursed Spirit.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.263
I see.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.852
We can't determine if the incidents were

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:09.314
done by the same Cursed Spirit
based on the residuals

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:11.608
since the incidents happened a while back.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:15.612
So I looked for similarities
that connect the three cases.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:20.074
They all attended
the same junior high for two years.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:24.037
That means they were cursed back then,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.748
and it took all these years to manifest?

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.832
Oh, wow!

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.627
Yes, that's possible.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.087
That's why we're going
to their junior high

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:36.841 line:20%
to speak to the victims'
common acquaintance.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:41.512
I hope you all can discover
something as Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.432
You're amazing, Kugisaki!

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.184
Of course.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.189

MORISHITA'S FUNERAL, 11:00 A.M.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.651
Funeral?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.654
Is that where the acquaintance lives?

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:01.157
It is, but…

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:04.661
<i>What a headache.</i>

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.664
<i>He died the same way as the other three.</i>

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.875
<i>He's living with his parents</i>

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.919
<i>and does not have an auto-lock door,</i>

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:15.588
<i>but he's also killed
at the front entrance.</i>

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:19.050
<i>It seems that when he returned home alone,</i>

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.761
<i>he told his family the door wouldn't open</i>

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:24.055
<i>even though it was unlocked.</i>

SAITAMA URAMI EAST JUNIOR HIGH

00:04:27.392 --> 00:04:29.477
I talked to his parents,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.064
but they were unsure of his relationship
with the other three victims.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.858
That's our only lead!

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:36.901
Don't mind.

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.320
There must be some hints in this school.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.489
I hope so.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.200
Anyway, I have an appointment
with a teacher.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.494
-I'll leave it to you guys.
-Understood.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:47.620
What?

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.791
They are bad students for sure.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.960
-Let's beat them up to reform them.
-Why?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:56.337
-What?
-What?

00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:58.756
What?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.011
Good day to you!

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.931
What? They are quite sensible to me.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.852
My strong aura cannot be suppressed.

00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:13.271
We haven't seen you
since graduation, Fushiguro!

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.522
-What?
-What?

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:21.696
This was my junior high.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.449
This is shocking too,
but that's not the point!

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:28.328
-Look over here!
-What have you done during junior high?

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.830
No, it's faster to ask them directly.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.708
Hey, Idiot A and Idiot B,
what did he do to you?

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.251
We…

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:39.130
Actually, half of the delinquents
around here

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:41.466
were beaten up by Fushiguro before.

00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:42.508
-What?
-What?

00:05:43.217 --> 00:05:44.469
-What?
-What?

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.474
I beat them up.

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:51.476
Why do you keep stuttering?

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.811
-Look here!
-What did you do?

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.563
Just what did you do?

00:05:55.646 --> 00:05:56.481 line:20%
Hey!

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:57.482
-What?
-What?

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.900
Who are you guys?

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.985
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.780
Who are you then?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.866
He must be a staff here.
Why are you so fierce?

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.743
We have permission to enter the school.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:12.080
Oh, it's you guys.

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.790
You all look so young.

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:17.043
Please wear the visitor pass
around your neck.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:18.211
Wait.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:20.254
Are you Fushiguro?

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:22.507
Hello.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.801
-He remembers you.
-He remembers you.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.345
Has he been in this school
for a long time?

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:28.554
I guess so.

00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.932
Mr. Takeda is a permanent staff.

00:06:31.015 --> 00:06:32.850
I'll leave the rest to you, then!

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.769
<i>She's neglecting her work duties.</i>

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.523
<i>Kanada, Shimada, Yamato,</i>

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.025
<i>and now Morishita?</i>

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:44.362
I'm surprised to hear about their passing,

00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:48.199
but I can't believe that they have
graduated for almost 20 years.

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:51.994
I still remember them
as if it were just yesterday.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.749
They were not on par with you,
but they were all troublemakers.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.292
What do you want to know?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.922
Were there any strange or bad rumors?
Do they mingle with bad people?

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.508
-A troublemaker.
-A troublemaker.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.261
Or did they do anything
that would incur bad karma?

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:10.471
Bad rumors?

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:14.851
They were troublemakers, but no more
than your average junior high student.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.854
Wait. Bad karma…

00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:19.730
Could it be that?

00:07:20.314 --> 00:07:22.483
Bungee jumping from Yasohachi Bridge.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:24.694
A and B, you're still here?

00:07:24.777 --> 00:07:26.737
Yasohachi Bridge?

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.489
A place known for suicides.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.200
It's a famous local hotspot
for paranormal activities.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.910
Right.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:37.081
It's popular among delinquents
to bungee jump from it.

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.960
-It's the so-called bravery test.
-Which tribe do they belong to?

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:43.463
There are many people dumber than me.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:45.131
How do they get the ropes?

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:47.341
We won't do such a thing.

00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:51.304
I only heard it from people
of my parents' generation.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:52.346
One day,

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.059
the four of them skipped school.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.730
It's nothing unusual,

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.857
but after contacting their family,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.110
<i>it turned out that
they didn't go home the night before.</i>

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.030
<i>It was quite a fuss back then.</i>

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:13.409
<i>Later, they were found lying
under the bridge.</i>

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.286
They were scolded badly,

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:19.457
but they insisted that
they don't remember anything.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.753
I think we're in the right direction.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.672
I have been to Yasohachi Bridge.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:27.798
To do a bungee jump?

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.217
Oh, god!

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.136
Paranormal hotspots
accumulate curses easily,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.721
just like schools.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:37.391
So people from Jujutsu High
regularly patrol those places.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.269
There was nothing special back then.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:44.482
It was just a famous bridge
that everyone uses regularly.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:47.068
We should go and check it out.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.778
Yes.

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.363
Fushiguro.

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:53.824
Sorry, but I have something to ask you.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.326
What is it?

00:08:55.409 --> 00:08:59.121
She took care of me
when she was in school.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.250
How is Tsumiki doing?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:04.752
She's doing well.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:06.754
Who is Tsumiki?

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:08.506
My sister.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:09.465
What?

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:12.218
You never tell us anything about yourself!

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.761
That's right!

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.515
Why don't they…

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.434
destroy these cursed relics?

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.270
It's because they can't do it.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.230
Not with Special Grades, that is.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.526
They can only halt its life stream
and preserve its existence

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:31.112
with a binding to stop it
from causing more damage.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:33.197
<i>Sukuna's fingers are harmful too, right?</i>

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:34.949
<i>That's an exception.</i>

00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.662
<i>After becoming a cursed object,
it is divided into 20 parts.</i>

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:43.040
<i>It's a monster that can
still attract curses after all this time.</i>

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:46.043
That's why Sukuna chooses its vessel.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.712
I see.

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:51.424 line:20%
So I can choose anyone?

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:55.553
Hey, you…

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.431
Is it money you want?

00:09:58.514 --> 00:10:00.808 line:20%
I don't have much money,

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.935 line:20%
but I can take a loan--

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.938
It's okay.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.899
He still can't see me in this situation.

00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.568
He's really lacking talent.

00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.321
Here, open your mouth.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.424
We're here.

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:36.594 line:20%
<i>Koinokuchi Canyon, Yasohachi Bridge.</i>

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:40.139 line:20%
<i>I'll cast the Veil immediately
once a Curse Spirit is confirmed.</i>

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:42.642
Got it!

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.647
Hey, sorry to disturb you
although you just woke up.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.233
Can you run some errands for me?

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:04.872
Come on, we can't even
find a trace of the curse.

00:11:05.873 --> 00:11:06.749 line:20%
SPICY COD ROE

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:10.127
I don't feel any residuals or aura.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:11.796
Really?

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.381
Then we might have been wrong.

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:14.799
Let's start over again.

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.176
I think we better not waste too much time.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:18.469
Why not?

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:21.806
That's a famous paranormal hotspot, right?

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:24.683
Someone else could be cursed too.

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:28.312
Furthermore, the death rate
is 100% as it stands.

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:31.023
We can't afford to lose any more lives.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:32.817
That's right.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.068
Aha!

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.320
Bungee jumping
used to be famous there, right?

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:38.823
So wouldn't jumping down be the key?

00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:41.534
Did she just say, "Aha"?

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:43.285
Yes, she did!

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.830
Itadori has tried that.

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:46.831
What?

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:53.087
Wait! Did you jump
using that vinyl string?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.217
SCREAMING

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.803 line:20%
I found you! That's great!

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:02.638
Fushiguro!

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.807
Who's that again?

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.684
Fushiguro's junior, right?

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:09.019
-You kept teasing him earlier.
-Oh, right!

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:11.689
You guys were talking about
Yasohachi Bridge.

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:13.524
I'm glad I found you guys.

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:15.526
Fujinuma?

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:17.820
She's my ex-classmate.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.655
She's my sister.

00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:24.034
Great. You still remember me.

00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:28.539
I told her about Fushiguro yesterday.

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:32.751
My neighbor, Morishita,
had a funeral at their house.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:39.550
My brother said that
you're investigating Yasohachi Bridge.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:43.053
I wonder if these
two things are connected?

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.141
What do you mean?

00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:50.853
I mean Morishita's death and that bridge…

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:53.814
-It's unrelated. We're just…
-I…

00:12:54.398 --> 00:12:55.858
I have been to that bridge.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:59.069 line:20%
I went there at night
during my sophomore year.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.071
Oh, my…

00:13:01.155 --> 00:13:04.992
Did any strange things happen
in your house recently?

00:13:05.075 --> 00:13:08.787
For example, a strange feeling that
only you experience at home.

00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:15.794
My family runs a local specialty store.

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:21.800
<i>But when I go back alone,
the automatic doors are wide open.</i>

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:26.889
<i>My parents said it was just a coincidence,</i>

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.601
<i>but there's definitely something there.</i>

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:32.770
I'm scared.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:37.483
At this moment, I heard about
Fushiguro investigating this incident.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.319
I recalled the incident
at Yasohachi Bridge.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:43.447
When did the automatic door
incident start?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:47.201
Exactly a week ago.
It happens every other day.

00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.328
<i>It took at least two weeks</i>

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:54.083
<i>for the four victims to die
after the abnormalities started.</i>

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:56.085
<i>There's still some time.</i>

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:59.880
You didn't go
to Yasohachi Bridge alone, right?

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.840
Do you recall who else was there?

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:06.470
-So those two incidents are related?
-They are related to automatic doors.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:09.932
But it has nothing to do
with Morishita's death.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:14.103
I'm writing a university report,
so I asked them to help me.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.272
It's titled,
"The Impact of Paranormal Hotspots

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.607
on Electromagnetic Waves
and Electronic Products."

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.442
It's lame, right?

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:23.112
But I want to hear from
as many people as possible.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.781
I hope you can tell me who went with you.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.285
<i>Since I lied, I must save her.</i>

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:35.541
I went there with two seniors in the club.

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.835
By the way, Fushiguro,

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.296
Tsumiki was there too at that time.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:44.300
<i>-Tsumiki?
-Fushiguro's sister!</i>

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:49.555
Really? I'll go ask Tsumiki, then.

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:53.475
Well then, I'll send them home first.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:56.145
Please take over from here.

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:58.147
Is there something wrong?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.150
I can't let you two
go back with a bicycle.

00:15:09.366 --> 00:15:10.576
Fushiguro.

00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:13.329
Fushiguro!

00:15:15.623 --> 00:15:17.333
Fushiguro, snap out of it.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.293
Confirm her safety first.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:24.465
I'm fine.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:26.800
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.185
I understand the situation.

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.270
You need protection for Tsumiki, right?

00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:43.025
However, only Grade 2
Jujutsu Sorcerers are available now.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.610
Grade 2?

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:48.697
<i>If the threat is greater than expected,</i>

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.617
<i>then we need to reexamine
the level of the curse.</i>

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:58.248
You're probably assigned this task
due to Itadori's growth.

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.460
If the threat continues to rise,

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.004
even Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerers
will not suffice.

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:06.507
<i>It's equally dangerous for all of you.</i>

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.176
<i>I would recommend that you retreat first.</i>

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.513
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.224
<i>Should I go back on my own first?</i>

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:19.186
<i>No, this task is dangerous
even if the three of us work together.</i>

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:21.397
<i>I can't leave it to the two of them.</i>

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.650
<i>Mr. Gojo will return next week.</i>

00:16:25.192 --> 00:16:26.902
<i>Until then…</i>

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:30.447
<i>No, I can't afford to wait anymore!</i>

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.117
<i>If the Cursed Spirit
does not attack proactively</i>

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.996
<i>and only activates its cursed technique
within its marks,</i>

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:39.373
<i>then it's useless to stay by her side.</i>

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:41.750
<i>I have to exorcise it now!</i>

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:44.837
Why were you talking to Mr. Ijichi?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.922
Is your sister all right?

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.008
She's fine.

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:52.136
The mission is getting more dangerous now.

00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:54.930
Other Jujutsu Sorcerers
will be taking over.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.932
You guys can go home.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.562
Wait. Why? We can go home first?

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.022
What about you?

00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.691
I'll say goodbye to Mr. Takeda
before returning.

00:17:05.774 --> 00:17:06.775
Come on. Hurry up.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.371
<i>Hello. Is this Ms. Nitta?</i>

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.415
<i>I have something to ask you.</i>

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:23.834
<i>It should be the sequence.</i>

00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:28.589
<i>Fujinuma didn't walk on the bridge.</i>

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.717
<i>The bravery test was done
under the bridge.</i>

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.887
<i>Itadori went under the bridge too.</i>

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.473
<i>Jumping off the bridge
probably doesn't count.</i>

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.600
<i>If the Cursed Spirit is within a barrier,</i>

00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:41.351
<i>then the sequence will be important.</i>

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.687
<i>It needs to be at night, under the bridge,</i>

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.439
<i>and one more condition…</i>

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.609
<i>It's impossible to cast a domain</i>

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:51.612
<i>using expanded
and sustained cursed technique.</i>

00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:56.158
<i>Which means, this domain
is similar to the unfinished one</i>

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:58.118
<i>back at the detention center.</i>

00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.038
<i>But this time, it's helpful.</i>

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.958
<i>I don't need a Veil.</i>

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:10.964
You never tell us anything about yourself.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:12.716
That's right.

00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.261
You're so out of your wits that

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.013
you didn't notice us at all.

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:21.225
You don't have to tell us
about everything,

00:18:21.308 --> 00:18:22.726
but at least rely on us.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.978
We're friends, right?

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.364
Tsumiki…

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:39.451
She is currently in a coma.

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:46.625 line:20%
The Yasohachi Bridge curse
will only appear in front of the cursed.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.505
<i>Since she can't speak,</i>

00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:55.092
<i>there's no way to know
when she'll be killed.</i>

00:18:57.845 --> 00:18:59.847
So I want to exorcise it right away.

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.392
But it's true that the mission
is more dangerous now.

00:19:03.475 --> 00:19:06.019
All right, we got it.

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:08.689
Just make it clear at the beginning.

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:17.865
<i>If the Cursed Spirit is within a barrier,
then the sequence will be important.</i>

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:20.701
<i>It needs to be at night, under the bridge,</i>

00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:22.619
<i>and one more condition…</i>

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.332
<i>There may be a river under the canyon.</i>

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:36.550
<i>The act of crossing a river or a barrier…</i>

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:40.929
<i>has significant meaning in sorcery.</i>

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.860
There it is.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:59.156
Seems like it will be worth exorcising.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.671 line:20%
What is this?

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:16.673
Someone's here first.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:17.674
What?

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:20.177
Fushiguro, that's unrelated
to the curse, right?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.678
Yes.

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:25.849
Then both of you focus on that one.

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.228
Let me handle this one.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.149 line:20%
What? Are you willing to play with me?

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.535
<i>-Juju Stroll.
-Juju Stroll.</i>

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.246
Someone, help! I got robbed!

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.171
I run a Chinese restaurant.

00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:21.423
I'll treat everyone to a meal as thanks.

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:22.716
You don't have to!

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:26.178
Really? Thank you for your kindness!

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.765
<i>This restaurant has been passed down
for four generations.</i>

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:33.852
It was supposed to close
during my father's generation,

00:22:34.436 --> 00:22:37.981
but I insisted on
inheriting the restaurant.

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:44.321
I want to pass on the restaurant
and the taste of our food.

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:47.365
-Such a good story.
-Such a good story.

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:49.284
Thank you for waiting.

00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:52.621
This is our signature dish,
fried dumplings set meal.

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.331
-I'm digging in!
-I'm digging in!

00:22:55.248 --> 00:22:57.209
Thanks for the hospitality.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.216
Guys.

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:08.386
What do you think about fried dumplings
with cabbage fillings?

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.680
Well said, Fushiguro!

00:23:10.764 --> 00:23:14.351
Although she's a really nice person…

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.481
But I think fried dumplings are considered
a vegetable dish, not a meat dish.

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.565
Are you serious?
