WEBVTT

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.047
This is pissing me off.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.425
Just come out now
if you're going to switch places.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.139
What's wrong, brat?

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.748
<i>The Innate Domain is sealed, and
the Special Grade Cursed Spirit is dead.</i>

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.294
<i>What's left is
for Itadori to return safely…</i>

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:51.593
Sorry, but he's not coming back.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.804
Don't be so scared.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.433
I'm in a good mood right now,
so let's chat.

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:05.440
This must be the price he's paying
for using me without any restraint.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:08.443
He seems to be having
some trouble switching back.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.696
But, well…

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.656
It is only a matter of time.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:18.870
So…

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.623
I thought about what I could do now.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.758
What are you…

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.267
I'm going to take him hostage.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.602
Hostage?

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:46.022
That's right.
I can still live without this,

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.690
but not the brat.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.986
If he switches with me, he'll die.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.072
And also…

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.200
I'm doing this to make doubly sure.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.746
<i>Sukuna's finger.</i>

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.958
<i>That Special Grade Cursed Spirit inside
must have had it.</i>

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.130
Okay, I'm finally free.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:13.216
You can start to panic,
I'm going to kill you.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.635
There's no reason.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.432
Our roles have reversed,
compared to that time.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:02.575 line:20%
<i>Only the inequality of reality
can equally exist.</i>

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.340
You don't seem to understand.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:18.925
That guy…

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:21.177
Itadori will be back.

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.888
Even at the cost of his life.

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:25.682
That's how he is.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.392
You're flattering him too much.

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:31.521
He's just a moron
who's a little stronger than most people.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:37.110
He was trembling
with the fear of dying earlier…

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.446
<i>while talking pretentiously to himself.</i>

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.949
I'm sure that

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.535
he doesn't have
the guts to commit suicide.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.454
<i>His hand has regenerated.</i>

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.881
<i>He can use the Reverse Cursed Technique.</i>

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.884
<i>Sukuna has completely possessed him.</i>

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:05.471
<i>Even if he can live without a heart,
he should be able to receive damage.</i>

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:09.559
<i>I have to restore Itadori's heart
before he comes back.</i>

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:13.187
<i>I have to convince him that he won't win
with a body that doesn't have a heart.</i>

00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:17.025
<i>Can I do that?</i>

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.571
<i>I couldn't even move
in front of a Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:28.202
<i>It's not a matter
of whether I can do it or not.</i>

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.704
<i>I have to do it!</i>

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.336
I finally managed to come out.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.047
Let's make full use of this place!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.473
How interesting.

00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:53.269
You're using a Shikigami,
so why would you come at me personally?

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.402
More!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.654
More.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.283
More!

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:11.954 line:20%
Put more curse into it…

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.124
and come at me.

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:20.004
<i>Great Serpent!</i>

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:27.720
All together now!

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.776
See? I told you.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.987
Let's make full use of this place!

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:11.264
<i>He's not even casting sorcery.</i>

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:15.476
<i>His strength and agility
are on a totally different level!</i>

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.353
Nice technique!

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.199
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.163
<i>I used Shikigami once
to leave the Innate Domain.</i>

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:39.667
<i>White Divine Dog
and Great Serpent were destroyed.</i>

00:07:40.168 --> 00:07:43.296
<i>On top of that, Nue is at its limit.</i>

00:07:44.422 --> 00:07:47.133
<i>It's better to dispel it
before it's destroyed.</i>

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.054
I see.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:56.434
So you use shadows
as a medium for your Shikigami?

00:07:56.517 --> 00:07:59.353
<i>It doesn't matter if he finds out now.</i>

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:01.481
So what?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:05.985
<i>It's not a common curse technique
that uses charms,</i>

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:07.945
<i>so it can be used in a lot of situations.</i>

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.949
I don't understand. Back then…

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.910
<i>Why did you escape?</i>

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.165
It's a waste of your talent.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:21.626
Forget it.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.755
In any case, I won't heal myself
with an attack like that.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:27.715
<i>He's seen through me.</i>

00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.301
You're risking your life
over such a foolish motive.

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:33.554
This brat doesn't even deserve it.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.060
<i>Then why did you save me?</i>

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:47.527
<i>Only the inequality of reality
can equally exist.</i>

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:52.907
If I have the ability to curse someone,

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.660
I would rather think about those
who are dear to me.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:08:59.497
<i>She's indisputably kind.</i>

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.585
<i>She deserved to have a happy life
more than anyone else.</i>

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.172
<i>Despite so, Tsumiki was cursed.</i>

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:15.513
<i>My father, who named me "Megumi"
even though he didn't know my gender,</i>

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:18.975
<i>is still living his life
brazenly somewhere.</i>

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:26.107
<i>Karma is not something
that happens automatically.</i>

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:31.237
<i>Evil people can only
be punished under the law.</i>

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:37.577
<i>Jujutsu Sorcerers act
as one of the gears in karma.</i>

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.086
<i>To ensure more good people
can enjoy equality…</i>

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.470
<i>I will save people unfairly.</i>

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:01.976
Brilliant.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:03.853
This is brilliant.

00:10:03.936 --> 00:10:08.357
So you're just getting fired up.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.026
I see.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.694
Well…

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:12.987
In that case,

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:16.782 line:20%
show me what you're made of,
Megumi Fushiguro!

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:24.373 line:20%
<i>Furube, yurayura.</i>

00:10:30.588 --> 00:10:32.256
Just to make it clear…

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:38.971
<i>I didn't have a logical reason
to save you back then.</i>

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:43.643
<i>Even if it's dangerous, I didn't want
to see a good person like you die.</i>

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:49.899
<i>I had my doubts, but I eventually
heeded my selfish emotions.</i>

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.902
But that's all right.

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:55.655
I'm no hero.

00:10:58.074 --> 00:10:59.533
I'm a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:06.123
So I've never regretted saving you.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.963
Is that so?

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:15.925
You are really smart, Fushiguro.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:18.135
You probably think way more than I do.

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:21.180
I think that what you believe in is right,

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.724
but I don't think I'm wrong either.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:28.687
Oh, man.

00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.773
Sorry, but it's almost time.

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:34.068
You, Kugisaki, and Mr. Gojo…

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.654
I guess I don't need
to worry about you guys.

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.825
Live a long life, you hear me?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.203
Hey, what's going on?

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:31.917
Was it really necessary
to lose a valuable finger

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:33.836
just to confirm Sukuna's strength?

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:38.549
Well, we won't get anywhere
with a half-hearted test.

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:40.968
We did gain something from that.

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.888
I hope you're not making excuses.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:50.561
Shut up! I can't understand a single word.

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:56.192
I can't understand it, but the words
speak directly into my brain.

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:57.735
It's so gross!

00:13:00.112 --> 00:13:02.323
CAFE RESTAURANT RISE

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.658
Welcome!

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.369
Table for one, sir?

00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:10.915
Yes, one.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.803
I told them to choose
between escape and death

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:26.597
when they encounter an enemy.

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:31.560
I've made sure to tell them not to fight.

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.688
That was intentional, right?

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:35.648
What?

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:37.441
What do you mean by that?

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:39.485
They were up against
a Special Grade Curse,

00:13:39.568 --> 00:13:41.904
and had to rescue
five people with unclear status.

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.532
There's no way they would get
the first-years to do this.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:49.036
And I was the one who forcibly granted

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:51.455
an indefinite postponement
on Yuji's death sentence.

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:53.415
The higher-ups were unhappy,

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.834
so they used a Special Grade Curse
while I was away…

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.463
to get rid of him silently.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:04.009
Even if the other two died,
it would have served to spite me.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:06.387
That's killing two birds
with one stone, isn't it?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.472
No, but…

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.724
When I sent them over,
I really didn't expect it

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.018
to turn into
a Special Grade Cursed Spirit.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.604
It's troublesome
to find the one behind this.

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:19.233
Let's just…

00:14:20.317 --> 00:14:22.736
kill all the higher-ups, shall we?

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:28.450
It's rare to see you get so emotional.

00:14:29.243 --> 00:14:31.453
Good work today, Ms. Ieiri!

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:35.708
You really like him.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:40.504
I'm a nice guy
who's always thinking about the students.

00:14:41.005 --> 00:14:43.299
Don't bully Ijichi too much.

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:46.719
It's not easy for him to get caught
between us and the chief.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:48.345
<i>-Speak more…</i>
-I'm not interested

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:50.556
<i>-Speak more!</i>
-in a man's pain and suffering.

00:14:50.639 --> 00:14:51.765
Is that so?

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:54.018
So is he the one?

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:58.480
Sukuna's vessel.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.942
I'm free to tear him apart, right?

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.403
Make good use of him.

00:15:04.486 --> 00:15:05.905
Oh, I will.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.407 line:20%
Who do you think I am?

00:15:13.537 --> 00:15:15.706
"Live long," he says?

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:19.418
How can he say that when he's dead?

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:23.088
Is this your first time
experiencing a friend's death?

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.549
It's a first for my classmate.

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:27.843
I see.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.845
Yet you look surprisingly calm.

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:31.513
You too.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:35.184
Of course.
I've only known him for two weeks.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:41.690
I'm not so weak that
I'll cry over a man's death.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:44.944
Darn it.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.539
It's so hot.

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:03.212
You're right. I wonder when we'll get
to wear our summer uniforms.

00:16:11.762 --> 00:16:13.514
What's going on?

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:17.977
Your face looks even worse
than usual, Megumi!

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.645
Are you mourning?

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.189
Zenin.

00:16:22.272 --> 00:16:25.192
-Don't call me by my last name!
-Maki!

00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.819
I'm talking here!

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:29.822
Don't you know why they look so depressed?

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.198
What do you mean?

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.492
Someone really died yesterday!

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:35.703
It was one of the first-year boys!

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:36.704
Bonito flakes.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:39.707
Say it earlier!

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.043
That would make me
a heartless witch, wouldn't it?

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:44.461
But that's who you are!

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.713
Tuna mayonnaise.

00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:48.757
-You're wrong! I can be considerate, okay?
-Who are they?

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:50.801
They are the second-year students.

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:54.471
Be gentle with your juniors.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:57.307
How is pampering considered being gentle?

00:16:57.391 --> 00:17:01.353
Zenin is the best student
when it comes to using Cursed Tools.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:02.730
Salted salmon roe.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.732
This is Inumaki, a Cursed Speech Sorcerer.

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.359
His vocabulary is limited
to <i>onigiri</i> filling ingredients.

00:17:07.443 --> 00:17:11.280
But you're gentler when you're with Yuta.

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.364
This is Panda.

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.201
We still have one more senior, Okkotsu.

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:19.204
He's the only one I respect, but…

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.166
He's currently overseas.

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:24.877
So you're just going to say
<i>that's</i> Panda, and nothing else?

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:28.172
My apologies.

00:17:28.255 --> 00:17:30.090
Sorry to disturb your mourning.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:32.301
Please forgive us!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.679
Actually, we hoped
that you two will attend

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:37.765
the Kyoto Sister-School Goodwill Event.

00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:41.101
Kyoto Sister-School Goodwill Event?

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:43.187
What's that?

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.774
It's an exchange
with another sorcery school in Kyoto.

00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.903
But isn't that for
second and third-year students?

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:54.323
Those good-for-nothing third-years
are suspended from school.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:55.949
So you guys have to come.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.120
So what's the exchange for?
Playing <i>Super Smash Bros</i>?

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:02.372
I won't lose
if they're playing the Wii version.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:04.249
I'll trash them with my Meteor Smash.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.293
Then three of us will play together.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:11.006
In the goodwill event, the principals
of the Tokyo and Kyoto High School

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.510
<i>will propose their own methods of dueling.</i>

00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:17.513
<i>Each method takes one day,
so that's two days in total.</i>

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.890
And that's the official consensus.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:23.477
We have group battles on the first day,
and individual battles on the second.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.853
It's always been like this.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.105
Salmon.

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:29.149
Group battles and individual battles?

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.736 line:20%
So Jujutsu Sorcerers
are going to fight one another?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.866 line:20%
Yes. It's a sorcery battle
without any rules, except you can't kill.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.829
In order not to get killed,
we'll provide intensive training.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:47.376
Wait, do you guys actually
have time for this?

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:49.878
I thought Jujutsu Sorcerers
are always understaffed.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:54.049
That's a good question.
The answer is yes, for now.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.261
<i>Human depression often accumulates
from late winter to early spring,</i>

00:18:57.344 --> 00:19:00.472
<i>and then erupts in early summer,
which in turn transforms into curses.</i>

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.099
<i>That's when we're the busiest.</i>

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.560
We're mostly busy all year long,

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.937
but things should be settling down soon.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.230
I see.

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.898
So you guys are coming, right?

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.067
Your classmate's dead, after all.

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.527
-I'll do it!
-I'll do it!

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.528
I…

00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:15.988
I…

00:19:16.655 --> 00:19:20.200
<i>I want to be strong,
and I'll do anything for it.</i>

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:24.454
But if the training and the games
turn out to be meaningless,

00:19:24.538 --> 00:19:25.664
I'm leaving immediately.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:26.832
Me too.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.503
That's the arrogant spirit we need.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:32.796
Bonito flakes.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.215 line:20%
CAFE RESTAURANT RISE

00:19:35.299 --> 00:19:37.551 line:20%
<i>That means, your boss…</i>

00:19:37.634 --> 00:19:41.555
wants to subvert the position
of humans and curses.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.765
Am I right?

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:46.143
Well, you got the gist of it.

00:19:46.226 --> 00:19:48.312
But there's something different.

00:19:48.812 --> 00:19:51.231 line:20%
Humans are full of lies.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:53.609
Beneath the emotions
and actions they show,

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.903
there's always something hidden in them.

00:19:57.029 --> 00:20:01.200
<i>But negative emotions
like hate and murder…</i>

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:03.619
<i>They are the irrefutable truth.</i>

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:07.456
We, the curses born
from these negative emotions,

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.792
are the only real, pure humans!

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.128
The fake ones should just disappear.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.257
And yet, you guys
are being wiped out right now.

00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.052
That's why I'm here to ask you…

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.930
How can we win
against the Jujutsu Sorcerers?

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:25.098
Before the war begins,

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:28.477
you need to fulfill two conditions
in order to beat them.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.604
What are the two conditions?

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.108
First, the one known
as the strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer…

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:38.779
<i>We must ensure that Satoru Gojo
is unable to fight.</i>

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:40.447
<i>Secondly,</i>

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:45.118
<i>you have to make Ryomen Sukuna
and Yuji Itadori your ally.</i>

00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:52.125 line:20%
Wait. Isn't that Yuji Itadori brat dead?

00:20:52.918 --> 00:20:53.877
I wonder…

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.837
<i>Who knows?</i>

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.971
<i>Don't look up without my permission.</i>

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:05.180
It makes me sick…

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.224
Brat.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:43.403
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Salmon.</i>

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:45.280
It stinks.

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.574
It doesn't stink.

00:22:48.283 --> 00:22:49.409
It stinks.

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:51.411
It doesn't stink!

00:22:51.495 --> 00:22:55.999
Why are you treating me like an animal?

00:22:56.083 --> 00:22:57.417
It's because you're a panda.

00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:58.710
Mustard.

00:22:58.794 --> 00:23:00.462
It smells like a wild animal.

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:03.173
I asked it to take a bath, but it refused.

00:23:03.256 --> 00:23:05.509
I don't want to get wet.

00:23:05.592 --> 00:23:08.845
But I don't sweat, unlike you guys.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:11.181
And I use deodorant every day.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:14.392
So I don't stink.

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.776
And that's what happened.
Come over and take a sniff.

00:23:23.276 --> 00:23:27.155
-Sniff…
-Sniff…

00:23:27.239 --> 00:23:30.867
-Sniff…
-Sniff…

00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:36.039 line:20%
It doesn't stink,
but it smells like the sun.

00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:40.085
<i>-The sun?
-The sun?</i>
