WEBVTT

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:10.635
I did nothing in the end.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.680
Will I be scolded?

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:28.445
You worked too hard compared to me.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.032
Oh, man.

00:00:37.954 --> 00:00:39.706
So pitiful.

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.923 line:20%
Shall I let you rest easy now?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.635
Good job.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.306
You're just a human. Don't act recklessly.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:57.891
I'll kill you.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:01.394
You're so annoying.
I just want to help him.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.897
Curses can't understand my kindness?

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.782
So where are the goods?

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.701
I got them.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.539
<i>Special Grade Cursed Relic, Ryomen Sukuna.</i>

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.125
<i>Jujutsu High School has six fingers.</i>

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:28.588
<i>Another Special Grade Cursed Relic,
Cursed Womb, Death Paintings.</i>

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:31.257
<i>Number one to three.</i>

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.178
<i>Most of the shrines in Jujutsu High School</i>

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.388
<i>are just disguises.</i>

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:41.601
<i>The setting changes every day
according to Tengen's barrier techniques.</i>

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:44.979
<i>Among thousands of doors,</i>

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:46.606
<i>only one leads to the vault</i>

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.861
<i>where highly dangerous cursed objects
like Sukuna's fingers are kept.</i>

00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:02.539
Only Tengen knows which door
leads to the vault on that day.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.415
No one should hinder you.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.376
Who is Tengen?

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.170
A Jujutsu Sorcerer with immortality
as his cursed technique.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.213
Immortality?

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.549
Compared to Satoru Gojo, who is stronger?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.926
He has eternal life,
but he will continue to age.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.929
Just treat him like a tree.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.807
Besides opening the barrier,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.851
he hardly interferes with the world.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:24.644
You don't have to bother about him.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.940
When we let Jujutsu High School
collect the finger back then,

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:34.195 line:20%
<i>I placed a talisman created by
Mahito's cursed energy on it first.</i>

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.614
<i>I placed it
on the first layer of the seal.</i>

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.449
<i>It won't peel off.</i>

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.077
You can find it easily.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:42.787
Are there any guards?

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.541
From the entrance to the vault,
there are two followers of Tengen.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.792
They are small fries.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.419
Forget them.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.379
Before the Veil is lifted,

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:55.884
I hope you can eliminate Jujutsu Sorcerers
who are on standby as quietly as possible.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.552
I want to ease Hanami's burden.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:58.553
Sure.

00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:02.974
Why don't we seal Satoru Gojo
inside the Veil?

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.979
<i>I don't want him to focus on Mahito,
which is our main goal.</i>

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:16.112 line:20%
Besides, I can't test the Veil
if he doesn't use his full strength.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.656
Trapping the students is the easiest way.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.118
Everyone except Sukuna's vessel
can be killed?

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:24.495
Yes, but I don't recommend it.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:25.747
What?

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:32.253
<i>Sukuna's behavior is quite different
from what I imagined.</i>

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.465
<i>This is just my guess,</i>

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:41.512 line:20%
<i>but I'm afraid some students there
might be landmines for Sukuna.</i>

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:44.641
If we step on the landmines,

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:48.394
the worst-case scenario is that
this mission will be in vain.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.689
Can't we just kidnap Itadori first?

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.399
He's quite useful anyway.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.276
No way. Itadori…

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.654
Sukuna himself is a time-bomb,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.740
for us and Jujutsu High School.

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:10.041
<i>I want to wait until the chaos
worsens to provoke him.</i>

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.588
<i>October 31st, Shibuya.</i>

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.883
<i>In order to seal Satoru Gojo,</i>

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.803
<i>we must keep the things
that are useful first.</i>

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.435
A few Curse Users will tag along.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.480
You can abandon Juzo Kumiya.

00:04:32.563 --> 00:04:35.608
He's not the kind
who will follow through with the plan.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.402
He'll hinder us in the future.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:42.573
Someone else will observe
the test results of the Veil.

00:04:42.657 --> 00:04:44.200
Get along well with them.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.912
He asked us to get along well, Jogo.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.831
I won't be going anyway.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:56.087
Come on. Wake up, Hanami.

00:04:56.587 --> 00:04:57.714
Let's go back.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.133
-Mahito.
-What?

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.888 line:20%
It's stressful for curses
to quell their killing intent.

00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:13.062
You're sounding more like a Cursed Spirit.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.154 line:20%
KYOTO JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.948 line:20%
<i>Next up will be casualties.</i>

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.744 line:20%
Three Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerers,
one Semi-Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:53.371
five supervisors,

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:55.081
and two treasury guards.

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:57.083
They are the Jujutsu Sorcerers on standby

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:01.170
working separately
under Mr. Gojo and Principal Yaga.

00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:03.923
Although we're still waiting
for Ms. Ieiri's report,

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:05.758
we're positive that it's done by

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:08.594
the Cursed Spirit that
Mr. Nanami encountered previously.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:09.679
Damn it.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:14.809
Should we let the students and other
Jujutsu Sorcerers know about this?

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:17.103
No.

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:19.647
Limit this news among the superiors.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.065
I don't want the Curse Users

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.318
to know about the missing
Special Grade Cursed Relics.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.571
Did the Curse User say anything?

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.864
Well…

00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:30.241
Although he can't keep a secret,

00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:34.078
he didn't provide any useful information.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.498
Regarding this attack,

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:42.211
he said he was just following his orders.

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:46.007
I just wanted to make a clothing rack.

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:50.261
I don't know the monk's name.

00:07:50.344 --> 00:07:52.472
<i>I don't even know its gender.</i>

00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:54.932
<i>It's a kid with a bob cut and white hair.</i>

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.937
A monk child with an unknown gender
and a bob cut?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.023
Any clues?

00:08:02.106 --> 00:08:03.357
No.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.109
I guess he made it up.

00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:07.487
Do we have anyone
skilled at making people confess?

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.658
Why were curses and outsiders able to
sneak past Master Tengen's barrier?

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.244
I believe it's due
to that Special Grade Cursed Spirit

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.121
who fought with the students.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.665
<i>That Cursed Spirit has a special aura.</i>

00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:24.128
<i>It's a Cursed Spirit,
but close to a spirit.</i>

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.840
<i>According to Aoi, that guy seems
to be able to submerge into plants.</i>

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.512
Master Tengen's barrier
is ineffective against plants, right?

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:37.433
His barrier was designed
to hide rather than protect.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.269
It will be weak once infiltrated.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:48.694
<i>Are they afraid that Sukuna's finger
will strengthen Yuji's potential?</i>

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:51.822
<i>Or did they do that
to strengthen themselves?</i>

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.409
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.497
Anyway, let's be glad
that the students are safe.

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:04.961
But the Sister-School
Goodwill Event must be canceled.

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:08.506
Wait a minute. It's not for us to decide.

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:09.715
-What?
-What?

00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:15.221
When did you become
good friends with that gorilla?

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.766
No, we're not really good friends, but…

00:09:18.849 --> 00:09:24.188
Although I do have some memories of it,
it felt like I wasn't exactly myself.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.399
What are you talking about?
Were you drunk?

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:30.528
Do you think I can drink
in that situation?

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:31.988
That's shocking.

00:09:32.488 --> 00:09:37.034
Fortunately, Fushiguro's injuries
were not serious.

00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:38.828
He can even eat pizza.

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:43.958
No, please bring food
that are easy to digest.

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:46.919
Don't complain.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.799
At that time, it seemed better that
my cursed energy was almost used up.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.928
After the roots were removed,
Ms. Ieiri was able to treat my wounds.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.013
Is that so?

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.514
So things like that can happen.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.891
Didn't you fight with that Cursed Spirit?

00:10:01.767 --> 00:10:02.935
Itadori.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.270
What?

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.897
You've gotten stronger.

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:09.400
Back then…

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:15.114
<i>We talked about our own truths.</i>

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:19.243
We both might have been right.

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:23.164
But on the other hand, we're both wrong.

00:10:23.247 --> 00:10:24.332
What?

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:26.584
Some questions have no answers, right?

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:28.002
Don't think too much.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.170
You'll get bald.

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.547
That's right. There's no answer at all.

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:34.425
Now it all depends on
whether or not we can accept it.

00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:38.220
You can't accept it
when you have no sense of self.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.681
A weak Jujutsu Sorcerer
has no sense of self.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.518
I'll get stronger too.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.480
I will surpass you soon.

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:52.443
You are still the same.

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:55.196
Don't talk among yourselves.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.157 line:20%
This is what I expect
from my brother's friends.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:04.413
Where are you going, brother?

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.082
I'm very grateful to you,

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:07.667
but please let me go!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.252
I was feeling abnormal at that time!

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:12.046
What are you talking about?

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.965
You were like that since middle school!

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:18.803
We're not from the same middle school!

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:22.640
CURSE

00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:25.142
<i>Hello, I'm the useless Miwa.</i>

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.895
<i>I said I'm useless,</i>

00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:31.899
<i>but I don't think I'm </i>that <i>useless.</i>

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:35.945
<i>But when a Special Grade
Cursed Spirit attacked us</i>

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.614
<i>and everyone was fighting hard,</i>

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.951
<i>I was sound asleep.</i>

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.744
<i>So I can't say anything.</i>

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:46.747
<i>Also…</i>

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.166
<i>Who broke my katana?</i>

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.085
<i>Mai's sister?</i>

00:11:51.627 --> 00:11:55.131
<i>Many things have happened, and I thought
the Goodwill Event would be canceled.</i>

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:57.883
<i>However, after a day off,</i>

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.886
<i>we're now…</i>

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.013
The game starts now!

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.765
<i>…playing baseball!</i>

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.149 line:20%
ONE DAY AGO

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:14.150 line:20%
<i>So…</i>

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:17.278
Many things happened,
and some people died.

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:20.156
What do you want to do?
Continue the Goodwill Event?

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:24.160
When you put it like that…

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.161
Of course…

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.164
We should continue.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.459
<i>Todo…</i>

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:33.461
Why?

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:38.674
First, mourning is only for those
close to the people who have passed away.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:41.093
That's not our concern.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.888
Second, since people have died,

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:47.641
all the more reason
we should get stronger.

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.978
Strength is built based on
the accumulation of results.

00:12:51.061 --> 00:12:53.481
Either suffer the defeat
or taste the victory.

00:12:53.564 --> 00:12:55.733
That is how we grow.

00:12:55.816 --> 00:12:59.737
Results are important
since they are physical proof!

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.574
I didn't expect Senior Todo
to be so serious.

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.618
He's seriously crazy.

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:09.205
Third, the feeling of
not finishing up things in school

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.290
will make you regret it for a lifetime.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.125
How old are you?

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.960
I don't really mind.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:16.378
We will win anyway.

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.380
It's ridiculous, but it makes sense.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.007
You should just rest, Kamo.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.383
I have no objection.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:22.468
Salmon.

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:24.887
Do we decide the individual battles
by drawing lots?

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.180
What?

00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:28.265
There are no individual battles this year.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.562 line:20%
The principals of both schools
will propose their own methods of dueling.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:36.815 line:20%
Each method takes one day,
so that's two days in total.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.901
And that's the official consensus.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.446
We have group battles on the first day,
and individual battles on the second.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.781
It's always been like this.

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:44.907
Salmon.

00:13:47.618 --> 00:13:51.038
I hate to follow a fixed routine.

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:54.792
Every year, the team events
are put in a box and opened on the day.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.591 line:20%
When Principal Gakuganji held the meeting,

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.594 line:20%
he only confirmed
what was needed for the day.

00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:07.304
BASEBALL

00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:09.557
What?

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.141 line:20%
-What?
-Oh, my!

00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.060 line:20%
-Baseball?
-You're here too?

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.354
What's this, Yaga?

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:18.315
No, I'm sure that
I wrote "individual battles."

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:21.068
Wait a minute, Satoru!

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.363
CURSE

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.574 line:20%
KASUMI MIWA, SECOND BASEMAN

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:32.329
It's a pop fly!

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:35.708
Nishimiya, don't run first!

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.544
Out.

00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:39.837
Why?

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.214
Just say it if you don't know the rules!

00:14:42.298 --> 00:14:44.842 line:20%
I know the rules!
I run when I hit the ball, right?

00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:48.470
Sacrifice fly? What's that?

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.014
A new torture method?

00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:51.515
You simpleminded fool!

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:54.602 line:20%
NORITOSHI KAMO, THIRD BASEMAN

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:56.854 line:20%
I heard that you repelled
the Special Grade.

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:57.897 line:20%
What?

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.109 line:20%
No, it's all thanks to Todo and Mr. Gojo.

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.611 line:20%
Are you playing with no helmet?

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.616
Itadori, why do you want
to be a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.951
At first, it just happened.

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:15.581
I'm afraid of loneliness,
and I want to help many people.

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:19.251 line:20%
When I die, I hope many people
will come and pay their last respects.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.257
<i>If Mother is not here,
I don't want to be a Jujutsu Sorcerer!</i>

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.887
You're talented, Noritoshi.

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:32.389
You can help many people.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.810
The more people you help,
the more people will acknowledge you.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:40.856
This way, all kinds of people
will come to help you.

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:43.567
You won't be alone anymore.

00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:46.904
When you become a great Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:50.407
come and pick me up.

00:15:53.953 --> 00:15:55.079 line:20%
I see.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:58.248
This is a good reason.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:01.001
Strike! Batter out, change!

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:03.504
Kamo, the ball is not going to hit itself!

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.215
TEAM KYOTO: 0

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.718 line:20%
They call me Tohoku's Maakun!

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.054
Tohoku's Maakun
is Masahiro Tanaka himself.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.640
-Maakun is a pitcher!
-Bonito flakes!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.727
What?

00:16:20.938 --> 00:16:22.606 line:20%
MECHAMARU

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.191
Wait a minute!

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:26.902
Kugisaki is mad. A fight's breaking out!

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.114
That's a pitching machine!

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:31.532
What are you talking about?

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.826 line:20%
That's the spare Mechamaru.

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.870 line:20%
Panda broke him the other day.
Of course, we have to use this.

00:16:36.954 --> 00:16:39.623 line:20%
Pitching machine?

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:43.377 line:20%
I don't know what that is.
Are you familiar with machines?

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.753 line:20%
Are you a geek?

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:48.632
How dare you keep blabbering…

00:16:48.716 --> 00:16:51.385
You're a high school student, right?

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:55.848
Bring it! I'll take you on!

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.766
She's on the base.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.268
She's really desperate.

00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.480 line:20%
MEGUMI FUSHIGURO, OUTFIELDER

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:09.528
Out.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.533 line:20%
PANDA, FIRST BASEMAN
HOPES TO BEAT UP ZEBRAS ONE DAY

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:25.961 line:20%
MAKI ZENIN, PITCHER

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:26.962
Damn it.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:36.221
MECHAMARU

00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:49.526
Gosh!

00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:54.615
All right, three points.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.749
-That's cheating!
-Bonito flakes!

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:05.501
Kugisaki, come back.

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:08.003 line:20%
DUE TO LACK OF PLAYERS,
AN OUTFIELDER MAY USE CURSED TECHNIQUE

00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:10.047
KYOTO
TOKYO

00:18:11.715 --> 00:18:13.008
Catcher, huh?

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:18.013 line:20%
You receive, pass, read the game,
do fielding, and many more.

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.517 line:20%
It's the perfect position
for you, brother.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:26.605
But I hope to go head-to-head
with you as the pitcher.

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:28.524
Todo.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.818
You can just be the pitcher.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:32.069
No.

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:34.947
Only Mechamaru can be the pitcher now.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.200
Promise me, brother.

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:43.163
If I hit a home run here,
it's your turn next to--

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.877
DID IT ON PURPOSE

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:53.006
Todo! Pull yourself together!

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.508
Nice pitch.

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.009
-Nice pitch.
-Nice pitch.

00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:57.761
-Nice pitch.
-Maki, nice pitch.

00:18:57.845 --> 00:19:00.681
-Nice pitch.
-Nice pitch.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:05.561
-Nice pitch.
-Nice pitch.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.187
-Todo.
-Nice pitch.

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:09.648
-Everyone…
-Nice pitch.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:11.650
-They hate you so much.
-Nice pitch.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:13.485
-Nice pitch.
-Nice pitch.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.823
Do you still hate Itadori?

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.576
It's not about hate or love.

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:25.038
According to sorcery rules,
Itadori's existence is forbidden.

00:19:25.122 --> 00:19:28.083
He's still alive
because of Gojo's stubbornness.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:32.421
You shouldn't distort the rules
because of an individual.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:38.093
Not to mention that Itadori
being alive may cause more deaths.

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:42.890 line:20%
But it's also true
that he has saved lives.

00:19:42.973 --> 00:19:46.852 line:20%
This time, he cooperated with Todo
to repel the Special Grade Cursed Spirit.

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:49.938
Although such things
are not limited to students,

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:53.692
Itadori will experience
a lot of regrets in the future.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.820
<i>"I should have done that."</i>

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.363
<i>"I wish they had done that."</i>

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.240
<i>"I should have said that."</i>

00:20:00.324 --> 00:20:02.034
<i>"I wish they had said that."</i>

00:20:06.246 --> 00:20:11.293 line:20%
Honestly, I don't know
if the decision on Itadori was right.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.090
But can't we just watch over him for now?

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:22.596
Hey.

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:23.680
He got on base!

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:26.183
Inumaki is fast.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.684 line:20%
Salted fish roe.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:29.436
Mai! Miwa!

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:31.021
Be careful of stolen base!

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:34.441 line:20%
Let's save our regrets…

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:36.693
for later.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.256
We got in.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:03.136
All right!

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:11.144
30TH SISTER-SCHOOL GOODWILL EVENT
2ND DAY, BASEBALL

TOKYO SCHOOL WINS, 2-0

00:21:13.313 --> 00:21:14.356
What?

00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:20.070
Yaga, think of a way
to deal with Gojo first.

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:53.371
<i>-Juju Stroll.
-Salmon.</i>

00:22:53.455 --> 00:22:54.998 line:20%
DO YOU PREFER RICE OR BREAD?

00:22:55.582 --> 00:23:00.378 line:20%
Rice? No, I like bread too.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.964 line:20%
Wait a minute.
Are the ingredients pollack roe?

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:04.091 line:20%
Rice.

00:23:04.674 --> 00:23:06.051 line:20%
I think it's rice.

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.595 line:20%
What? I would definitely choose bread.

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:10.430 line:20%
Salted rice balls.

00:23:10.514 --> 00:23:13.725 line:20%
I'm a panda! Of course, I choose bread!

00:23:13.809 --> 00:23:15.811 line:20%
Do you want to get killed?

00:23:16.853 --> 00:23:18.355
Was that…

00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:22.234
a little far-fetched?

00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:24.528
He ran out of jokes.

00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:25.862
Time to go back.
