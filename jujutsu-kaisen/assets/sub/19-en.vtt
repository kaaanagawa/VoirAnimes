00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.639 line:20%
Are you okay, Inumaki?

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.724 line:20%
Salmon.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:17.559
It's coming!

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.394
Stop!

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.732
Convergence, Piercing Blood!

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:28.570
<i>He hurt it with his technique.</i>

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.865
<i>So he wasn't serious when he fought me?</i>

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.452
Hurry up! It will heal itself soon!

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:42.041
<i>Let Inumaki stop it,
then we'll attack and gain distance.</i>

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.170
<i>We'll rinse and repeat
to escape out of the Veil,</i>

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.046
<i>and meet with the principal and others.</i>

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.926
<i>But we don't know
if we can keep doing this.</i>

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.848
<i>The Cursed Speech
is becoming less effective.</i>

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.225
<i>And there's no time
to contact any teacher.</i>

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.896
<i>If that thing finds a way
to deal with Cursed Speech,</i>

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.439
<i>then it's over.</i>

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:08.401
Hurry up!

00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:13.031
<i>We don't know its motive, too.</i>

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:18.369
<i>The principal and other Jujutsu Sorcerers
may not be coming just yet.</i>

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.456
<i>We have to find Todo.</i>

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.043
<i>Or at the very least,
we should meet up with Miwa.</i>

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:39.641
Inumaki will stop it,
so don't worry and go!

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.893
Stop--

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:52.403
<i>Have we reached our limit first?</i>

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.873
Are you alive, Kamo?

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:11.631
<i>Inumaki's throat already gave out
even without using powerful words.</i>

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.800
<i>This shows that…</i>

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.010
<i>the enemy's far superior.</i>

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:24.727
Leaf mustard.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:30.650
Inumaki, you can't…

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:42.579 line:20%
Blast Away!

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.058
This blunt sword cannot hurt me at all.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.908
The tree branch in its eye socket
is more fragile.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.828
This katana is not too bad.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.043
I have something even better.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:35.298
Although using it makes me feel disgusted.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:42.597
<i>Cursed Tools are weapons
infused with cursed energy.</i>

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.560
<i>The power and potency
of these Cursed Tools</i>

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.647
<i>are categorized into four grades,
just like Jujutsu Sorcerers.</i>

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.358
<i>The higher the grade,</i>

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.195
<i>the greater the advantage granted
to the user in a sorcery battle.</i>

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.282
<i>You must not lose this, Megumi.</i>

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.700
<i>I won't lose it.</i>

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:05.787
<i>It's worth at least 500 million yen.</i>

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.704
<i>What?</i>

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.083
Special-Grade Cursed Tool, Playful Cloud!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.809
That attack wasn't too bad.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.312
Divine Dog…

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.482
<i>With the exception
of The Well's Unknown Abyss,</i>

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.609
<i>if the shikigami
from my Ten Shadows Technique</i>

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:39.153
<i>is completely destroyed,</i>

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.948
<i>they will never manifest again.</i>

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:50.915
<i>But the cursed technique and power
left by the destroyed shikigami…</i>

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.546
<i>will be inherited by other shikigami.</i>

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.551
…Totality!

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.808
<i>It's fast.</i>

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.311
<i>Are they planning
to finish my injured arm first?</i>

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.524
<i>The young Jujutsu Sorcerer
is in the forest.</i>

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.655
<i>It's that boy's sword.</i>

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:26.951
Maki!

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.838
Don't ever make me use
that three-sectioned staff again.

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:40.339
It's too hard to use.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.633
It's useful when you're used--

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:43.551
Megumi!

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.599
Maki!

00:05:49.682 --> 00:05:52.185 line:20%
Darn it! I was too careless!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:57.607
I aimed it at your heart.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.734
Your reflexes are outstanding.

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:03.321
Jujutsu Sorcerers are truly emotional.

00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:09.619
They are full of openings
when their allies are hurt.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.249
<i>Is it destroyed? It can't be.</i>

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.710
<i>Megumi's cursed technique
has been dispelled.</i>

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.714
You better stop using cursed techniques.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:26.302
The sprouts in your body
love cursed energy the most.

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:31.599
The more cursed technique you use,
the bigger it grows inside your body.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.810
Thank you for your explanation.

00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.104
You plan to kill me anyway.

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:40.358
I heard that it's more effective
after the explanation.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.153
You move well.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:53.412
But your movements
aren't as sharp as before.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:05.424
<i>I have to squeeze out cursed energy,
even if my stomach explodes.</i>

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:09.679
<i>Unlike everyone else,</i>

00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:12.849
<i>I choose who I will protect.</i>

00:07:14.392 --> 00:07:17.186
<i>I have the least to lose.</i>

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.147
<i>So…</i>

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:26.446
<i>I'm not allowed to fall
before anyone else does!</i>

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.576
Don't do it, Megumi!

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.499
Our work ends here.

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.918
It's time to tag out.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.970
What?

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:59.520
Can you do it, my friend?

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:03.733
Yes!

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:41.998
You're so heavy.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.960 line:20%
<i>I didn't expect these two
to end up in this condition.</i>

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:49.297 line:20%
I'm counting on you, Todo.

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.010
<i>You're nothing else but powerful.</i>

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.224
Don't, Itadori.

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:03.227
That's not something we…

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.064
Panda.

00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:08.566
Yes.

00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:12.653
Take them, and leave the Veil.

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:17.199
Nishimiya said that this Veil
is aimed at Satoru Gojo.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.202
We can go in and out anytime.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.497
-Wait. Even if it's you--
-Fushiguro!

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:24.582
What?

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.836
It will be okay.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:30.087
<i>Please.</i>

00:10:32.673 --> 00:10:34.884
It seems that you noticed.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:39.764
Someone growing out of his shell
cannot be touched by anyone else.

00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:43.100
That's what is happening to Itadori now.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.312
If you die again, I will kill you.

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:48.898
Come on. Let's go.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.692
Panda sprint!

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:55.112
Guess that means I can't die.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:58.199
I won't intervene,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.284
Itadori.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.080
Not until you manage to use Black Flash.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.707
If you're unable to use Black Flash,

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:11.754
then I'll be prepared to watch you die.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.255
Got it!

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.217
<i>That's Sukuna's vessel…</i>

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.177
<i>and who's that man?</i>

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:23.265
<i>He's bold, but based on
his amount of cursed energy,</i>

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:26.352
<i>he's definitely weaker than me.</i>

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.355
<i>But he has enigmatic strength.</i>

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:32.400
<i>Does he have a powerful cursed technique?</i>

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:35.778
<i>I shouldn't be reckless for now.</i>

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.364
<i>Besides, what is this "Black Flash"?</i>

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.534
<i>Now then, what will they do?</i>

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.248
Can you talk?

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.376
I have a question for you.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.088
Among your comrades,

00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:58.217
is there a patch-faced Cursed Spirit?

00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:02.221 line:20%
What if I say yes?

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.893
You're vigilant when closing the distance.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.812
This is commendable.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:13.065
<i>He's fast.</i>

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:16.026
<i>He has more momentum
than that girl just now.</i>

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:19.822
<i>However, he has weak power.</i>

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:22.283
<i>Its torso is defenseless.</i>

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.369
<i>It underestimated me
because of my weak attack!</i>

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:26.787
<i>This will work!</i>

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.706
<i>Black Flash!</i>

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.000
<i>It's coming.</i>

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.545
<i>Darn it!</i>

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.303
My friend.

00:12:45.723 --> 00:12:49.727
Anger is an important trigger
for Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:55.900
Sometimes, angering your opponent
can make them perform worse.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.360
The same goes vice versa.

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:00.779
Anger can mess up your cursed energy,

00:13:00.863 --> 00:13:04.033
making you lose
without showing your true strength.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:05.409
Got that?

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.578 line:20%
Your friend was injured,

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:12.541 line:20%
and more importantly, they interrupted
your honeymoon with me, your best friend.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:17.421 line:20%
I can understand
how angry you are right now.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:21.425
But this anger is too much for you.

00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:23.928
Suppress it now.

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:29.892
<i>Are they fighting among themselves?</i>

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:33.479
Did the distractions get drowned out?

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:36.440 line:20%
Yes.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:38.067 line:20%
They vanished without a trace.

00:13:39.068 --> 00:13:42.238
Thank you so much, best friend!

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:45.533
<i>Black Flash.</i>

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:50.371
<i>It is a distortion in space
that occurs when cursed energy</i>

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:55.125
<i>is applied with 0.000001 seconds
of a physical hit.</i>

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:59.630
<i>On average, the force of strike
is raised 2.5 times.</i>

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:04.426
<i>No Jujutsu Sorcerer is capable
of using it at will.</i>

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.637
<i>However,</i>

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:11.642
<i>for those who have experienced
and not experienced Black Flash,</i>

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:16.647
<i>there's a huge difference between
the distance to their cursed energy cores.</i>

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:24.989
<i>What immense concentration.</i>

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:28.951
<i>At the moment when the cursed energy</i>

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:32.162
<i>collides with the strike
within less than 0.000001 seconds…</i>

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:35.583
<i>Space will be distorted.</i>

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.544
<i>The cursed energy flashes black!</i>

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:40.796
Black Flash!

00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:45.843 line:20%
<i>What?</i>

00:14:52.016 --> 00:14:53.309 line:20%
<i>You did it.</i>

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.532
He did it.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.040
That was Black Flash?

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:18.751 line:20%
<i>What's this?</i>

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:22.463 line:20%
<i>This cursed energy is mine, right?</i>

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:25.549 line:20%
You just understood
the taste of cursed energy.

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:32.014
<i>Until now,</i>

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.017
<i>you were just throwing
unfamiliar ingredients</i>

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.605
<i>into the pot and stewing them
based on your feelings.</i>

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.067
But with Black Flash,

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.029
you now understand the taste
of the ingredient known as cursed energy.

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:48.697
<i>As a chef,</i>

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.534
<i>you're now a different person
from who you were three seconds ago.</i>

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.124
You can become stronger.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:05.297
<i>I heard that Sukuna's vessel
was just a subpar sorcerer.</i>

00:16:05.923 --> 00:16:08.801
<i>On top of that, that mysterious man…</i>

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:12.054
<i>They are somewhat different
from the others.</i>

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.056
It can heal itself?

00:16:14.556 --> 00:16:17.601
A Cursed Spirit's body
is made with cursed energy.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:23.440
Unlike us, they don't need advanced
reversal cursed technique to heal.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:27.569
For a Special-Grade,
this kind of injury is nothing.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:31.281
But it can undoubtedly
use up its cursed energy.

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.326
It's game over once you crush its head.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.330
Come, let's start cooking!

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:44.461
It appears that…

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:49.425
I have to be more serious
when dealing with the both of you.

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.320
What a wide attack range.

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:13.615
Don't be scared!
It's sacrificing its power and speed.

00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:22.875
<i>It's so heavy.</i>

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.628
<i>It's not as powerful
as that Black Flash just now,</i>

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:32.634
<i>but their respective powers
can indeed hurt me.</i>

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.763
Todo, let's match our timing better!

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:36.889
Got it!

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.807
What?

00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:40.934
<i>Our footing…</i>

00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:42.227
<i>We're too careless.</i>

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:43.645
<i>That thing was so huge,</i>

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:47.191
<i>I thought it was controlling real plants
with its cursed energy.</i>

00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:51.278
<i>Turns out that everything was
just manifested using cursed energy!</i>

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.197
<i>As expected from a Special-Grade!</i>

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.658
Appreciate how precious the earth is.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.912
<i>Attacking us while we're falling?
That's sick!</i>

00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:00.829
<i>However…</i>

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.461
<i>They dodged that?</i>

00:18:07.961 --> 00:18:09.755
<i>But what's going on?</i>

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:12.758 line:20%
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:23.227
You should be more honest, Hanami.

00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:27.189
I'm not hiding anything.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:30.484
I don't mean that you're a liar.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.529
I know why you fight.

00:18:33.612 --> 00:18:37.866
But I think you should learn
to enjoy the process more,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.744
which is fighting.

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:43.705 line:20%
Do you enjoy fighting, Mahito?

00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:45.332 line:20%
Kind of.

00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:46.750 line:20%
However…

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.170
<i>The joy and happiness
that I feel in a fight</i>

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:53.507
<i>only became my motivation recently.</i>

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.300
Once I realized,

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.053
deception, cheating, and killing…

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.764
They started to give me satisfaction.

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:04.143
<i>Like how human beings eat,
sleep, and commit violence,</i>

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:07.020
<i>I guess this is the nature of us curses.</i>

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:11.316
We may have gained rationality.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:16.405
But this is no reason for us
to go against our instinct.

00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:21.535
The soul is a mixture
of instinct and rationality.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:27.291
Others should not criticize
your mixing ratio.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:31.628
However, I believe your soul
feels a little restrained.

00:19:33.172 --> 00:19:34.423
Hanami…

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:39.344
You're actually stronger, right?

00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:43.265
It hurts…

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.559
Todo!

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.603
I'm okay.

00:20:03.493 --> 00:20:05.204
<i>It used up a lot of cursed energy.</i>

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.582
<i>This is the time to destroy it!</i>

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:10.459
<i>You monster!</i>

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.469
<i>Mahito.</i>

00:20:21.053 --> 00:20:22.554
<i>I am…</i>

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.557
<i>enjoying…</i>

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:28.727
<i>this fight now!</i>

00:20:30.979 --> 00:20:33.106
Are you okay, brother?

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.151
-No problem!
-Good. In that case…

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:40.447 line:20%
It's time to unleash my cursed technique.

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:13.415
-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:15.375
Clothing rack!

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:19.379
I can make an amazing clothing rack.

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:25.218
Hey, how does Satoru Gojo's
clothing rack look like?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.722 line:20%
It should be a single-pole clothing rack.

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:31.808
<i>The sacrum will be the stand.</i>

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:35.187
<i>Using the hip bone
with the coccyx as a base,</i>

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.273
<i>I'll fix it with processed thigh bone.</i>

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:42.944
<i>For the spine,
I'll use the lumbar and thoracic vertebra,</i>

00:22:43.028 --> 00:22:45.530
<i>all the way
until the third cervical vertebra.</i>

00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.450
<i>As for the length, well…</i>

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.118
Jindaikusu <i>wood would be good.</i>

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.954
<i>I'll use</i> Jindaikusu <i>wood
to create spine replicas</i>

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:55.624
<i>and insert them in between
to increase the height.</i>

00:22:57.084 --> 00:22:59.669
<i>I'll observe the overall balance,</i>

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.716
<i>and lengthen the spinous
and transverse process to make hooks.</i>

00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:11.098
<i>I should also use</i> Jindaikusu <i>wood here
to make it look like I'm grafting.</i>

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.433
<i>Depending on the brain color,</i>

00:23:13.517 --> 00:23:16.853
<i>I can also use it to wrap around
like suede leather.</i>

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:20.524
Wow! It's going to be so good.

00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:24.444
I can make an amazing clothing rack!

00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.862
I don't want that.
