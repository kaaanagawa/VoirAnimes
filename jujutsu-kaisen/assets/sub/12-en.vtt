WEBVTT

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.636
I'm going…

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:13.555
Nanami.

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:15.140
I won't allow it.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.934
I told you the reason this morning.

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.396
<i>Now that they have put on the Veil,</i>

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:26.526
<i>he's probably still alive
and in Satozakura High School now.</i>

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:33.908
I'll come right away.
Please be on standby, Itadori.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.039
<i>I guess it's useless to say that.</i>

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.461
That's all.
I'll leave the rest to you, Ino.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.378
What?

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.423
Is there a problem?

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.426
No, but their numbers…

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.803
There are too many of them.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.431
And they are all humans, right?

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:01.770
I can recommend you to become
a Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.109
I'll do my best!

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.653
All right!

00:01:13.698 --> 00:01:15.742
Step aside, Mr. Ijichi.

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.621
Our job is to save people.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.625
That includes you, the students.

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:28.421
<i>I won't make the same mistake again.</i>

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.259
You can't go, Itadori.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:38.765
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Ijichi.</i>

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.818
What are you doing, Junpei?

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.532
Step aside, Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.218
Moon Dregs!

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.517
<i>Jellyfish Shikigami?</i>

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.646
<i>My attacks don't work
after he goes inside it!</i>

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.523
I'll repeat myself.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:54.734
Step aside, Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.237
This has nothing to do with you.

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.281
That's not for you to decide!

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:05.119
What's the point
of randomly saving people?

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.456
Don't mistake…

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.333
the value of life!

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.508
The heart,
the so-called compassion by human beings,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.220
is just the metabolism of the soul,
and it's an illusion!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.807
Don't use illusive rules to restrain me.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.727
Those who deserve to die
shouldn't be spared.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.187
You have no right to stop me.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.773
Just sleep in there.

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:36.276
I have work to do.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:41.614
<i>Your cursed technique…</i>

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.324
<i>is poison.</i>

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:46.995
The poison extracted
from your cursed energy

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.622
is secreted through
the tentacles of Shikigami.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:53.584
The toxicity level, size, and strength
of the Shikigami can be changed.

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:55.086
Just take your time to learn.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.549
It usually takes years for
Jujutsu Sorcerers to learn that skill,

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:03.136
but I can teach you,
so you'll be able to fight soon.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.098
Junpei, you're truly talented.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.979
Who are you making excuses for?

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.834
<i>Why?</i>

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.462
<i>Moon Dregs' poison is ineffective on him!</i>

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.181
<i>Why must you hinder me?</i>

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.098
<i>Why…</i>

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:51.225
<i>Why…</i>

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:53.853
<i>Why?</i>

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.361
<i>He can't move in the air.</i>

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:06.032 line:20%
<i>If I want to crush him, I need to
strike him while he is in mid-air!</i>

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:18.503
I don't understand a single thing…

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.465
you're saying, Junpei!

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.302
Even if you said something
that quite makes sense.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:31.182
The best way to beat a Shikigami
is to go for the user.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.601
You just…

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.774
want to think that you're right.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.989
I don't know your motives.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.950
You must have had a reason.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:51.035
However…

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.121
Is it really…

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.415
<i>worth giving up that kind of life?</i>

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.713
You said the human heart is illusive.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:05.758 line:20%
But could you say that to your mother?

00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:10.346
People don't have hearts…

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.140
-You're still…
-They don't!

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.809
Otherwise…

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.728
Otherwise…

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:20.022
Are you saying that my mother and I

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:23.359
have been cursed by people with hearts?

00:07:25.403 --> 00:07:28.239
That's too much.

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:34.495
I no longer know what's right and wrong.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:44.172
Why…

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.176
Why didn't you evade it?

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.098
I'm sorry.

00:07:54.765 --> 00:07:58.561
I didn't know anything,
but I said those things.

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:05.109
Tell me what happened.

00:08:06.527 --> 00:08:10.406
I'll never curse you, Junpei.

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.742
So…

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:22.877
How could this be? Your mother…

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:31.969
Junpei, come to Jujutsu High.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.889
<i>We have very strong teachers</i>

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:37.850
<i>and plenty of reliable comrades.</i>

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:40.978
If we work together,

00:08:41.479 --> 00:08:45.024
we can find the culprit
who cursed your mother.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.110
We will avenge her!

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.655 line:20%
Let's fight together!

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.825
What?

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:57.245
Who are you?

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.581 line:20%
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:03.459
<i>Is he a human?</i>

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.836
Nice to meet you.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.839
<i>No, this sensation…</i>

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.800
Sukuna's vessel.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.178
Wait, Mahito!

00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.934
<i>Am I an idiot?</i>

00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:22.353
<i>A human-looking Cursed Spirit
with a patchwork face…</i>

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:25.356
<i>It's exactly the Cursed Spirit
that Nanami described!</i>

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.400
Run, Junpei!

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:30.611
I don't know what
your relationship is with him,

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:33.322
but run away now!

00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:34.407
Please!

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.701
Calm down, Itadori.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.953
Mahito is not…

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.712
<i>A bad person.</i>

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:56.012
You know you're smart, right, Junpei?

00:09:57.513 --> 00:10:00.725
But sometimes, deliberation
can lead to more serious consequences

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.393
than rash actions.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.021
You're the typical example.

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.817
You're just as stupid as those

00:10:10.318 --> 00:10:12.737
you looked down on.

00:10:15.072 --> 00:10:17.491
And that's why you'll die.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.120
<i>Idle Transfiguration.</i>

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.758
Come on, let's begin the second round!

00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.509
Junpei…

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.180
Junpei!

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:41.599
Snap out of it!

00:10:41.682 --> 00:10:43.434
I'll treat you now.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.483
Sukuna…

00:10:52.026 --> 00:10:53.861
Sukuna!

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.280
What is it?

00:10:57.865 --> 00:10:59.450
I'll do anything!

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.369
Do whatever you want with me!

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:04.622
So please heal Junpei like how you…

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:06.832
cured my heart back then!

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.377 line:20%
I refuse.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.716
Darn you.

00:11:18.552 --> 00:11:22.807
<i>Good. He has forgotten
about our Binding Vow.</i>

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.519 line:20%
I'm so happy!

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:32.566 line:20%
You gave up your pride and future.
You gave up everything to beg me.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.612 line:20%
But you can't save anything.

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:38.823
<i>He rejected the Binding Vow?</i>

00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:44.203 line:20%
<i>Although souls can't use
Reverse Cursed Technique to heal…</i>

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.207 line:20%
<i>Is he not good at treating others?</i>

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.626
You're so miserable.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:53.754
You're so miserable, brat.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.093
<i>But this is just
the first step towards my goal, anyway.</i>

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:00.928
<i>This is pretty good too.</i>

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:20.698
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:22.283
<i>In the end,</i>

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.452 line:20%
<i>they are nothing…</i>

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.037 line:20%
<i>but evil curses.</i>

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.628
Yuji…

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.930
Why?

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:13.918
He's dead already?

00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:17.546
I did transfigure him
a little too violently, after all.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:21.759
No wonder he's dead.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:27.348
<i>That's some kind of strange attack.</i>

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:28.682
<i>Interesting!</i>

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:31.268
Unfortunately, it doesn't work.

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:33.646
As long as I maintain
the shape of my soul…

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:35.314
What?

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:39.360
<i>What's happening?</i>

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.032
<i>Even my soul got beaten up.</i>

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:47.868
<i>Oh, right.</i>

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.621
<i>Yuji Itadori is a vessel.</i>

00:13:50.704 --> 00:13:55.209
<i>There is another soul
that dwells inside his body.</i>

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.628
<i>So naturally…</i>

00:13:58.837 --> 00:14:00.548
Can you perceive it?

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:03.509
<i>The contours of my soul, that is!</i>

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:17.481
<i>It's as if what I've said were all lies.</i>

00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:19.650
<i>My true intention is…</i>

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:23.112
I'll fucking kill you.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.130
Aren't you mistaking it for "exorcise"?

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.506
Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:14:45.676 --> 00:14:49.680
<i>Yuji Itadori
has no regard for his own life.</i>

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.182 line:20%
<i>Geto doesn't allow me to use
an external Binding Vow</i>

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:54.560
<i>such as taking hostages.</i>

00:14:55.853 --> 00:15:00.441
<i>Then if he meets someone he wants
to kill badly but is unable to,</i>

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:02.735
<i>will he rely on Sukuna?</i>

00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:05.613
<i>If Junpei's death isn't enough,</i>

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:09.241
<i>I'll just have to kill everyone
in this school.</i>

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.328
<i>A hatred that transcends
his own interests will impose</i>

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:17.249
<i>a Binding Vow on Yuji Itadori
in Sukuna's favor.</i>

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.129
<i>It would be better if it increases
the chance of Sukuna joining us.</i>

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:30.512 line:20%
<i>But this means
I have to be stronger than him.</i>

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.598
<i>And surprisingly, I'm up against…</i>

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.142
<i>my mortal enemy.</i>

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.914
<i>He keeps reshaping his soul.</i>

00:15:56.997 --> 00:16:00.292
<i>Should I not grapple him after a throw?</i>

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.587
<i>Since his attack is effective,</i>

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.257
<i>it's not a good idea to transform
my body to give him a bigger target.</i>

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:10.010
<i>-In that case…
-In that case…</i>

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:13.305
<i>I'll do it a hundred or thousand times.</i>

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.767
<i>I'll continue to strike…</i>

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:19.520
<i>until you're crushed!</i>

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:26.735 line:20%
<i>Let's change into
a streamlined form that's…</i>

00:16:28.612 --> 00:16:29.863
<i>optimal for killing!</i>

00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:58.976
I'm sure you can't stretch forever.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.121
Normal people would have let go of it.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.666
<i>If I extend my shape too wide,</i>

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.793
<i>the operability
and strength will decrease.</i>

00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:52.071
You can't beat me.

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:54.490
Hurry up and switch.

00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:57.451
Switch to Sukuna.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.455
Idle Transfiguration.

00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.174
Did you just touch my soul?

00:18:12.674 --> 00:18:15.969
We both laughed at this brat
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:17.679
I'll forgive you once.

00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:20.307
There's no second chance.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:25.729
Know your place…

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:29.066
you fool.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.032
I'm not going to switch.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.575
I told you, didn't I?

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:42.913
I'll fucking kill you.

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:19.283
What?

00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.292
Oh, my.

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:29.793
What?

00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:31.920
Nanami…

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.844
I'll lecture you later.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:40.971
Report the situation first.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.767
I couldn't save them both.

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:49.104
<i>He's always thinking of others.</i>

00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:52.316
How are you doing physically?

00:19:53.358 --> 00:19:54.776
I'm fine.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.945
I have a lot of holes, though.

00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:59.198
How is that fine?

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:03.535
Also, everyone from the school
is unconscious in the gym.

00:20:04.494 --> 00:20:08.707
Hey. You look energetic, 7:3 Sorcerer.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:12.211
It's great that we're both doing well.

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.421
Shall we hug…

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:17.174
to celebrate our reunion?

00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.515
Itadori, why is his nose bleeding?

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:26.642
What?

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.810
I punched him.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.355
-When?
-At the very start.

00:20:31.438 --> 00:20:33.232
Did he touch you with his hand?

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:34.608
Yes.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.111
My attacks have zero effect on him.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.113
What?

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.824
-Why?
-The reason will come during the lecture.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.496
<i>First, he may not be able
to use his ability on Itadori.</i>

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.707
<i>Second, he has a reason
not to kill Itadori.</i>

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:53.001
<i>Either way, it's an advantage.</i>

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.421
But I can stifle his movements.

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:01.551
Let's create openings for each other
and take the opportunity to attack.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.472
We must exorcise him here.

00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.101
Okay!

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:43.487
