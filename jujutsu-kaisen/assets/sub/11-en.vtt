WEBVTT

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:04.421
Is that all, Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.256
You tried so hard to escape.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.383
But you should be
reaching your limits, right?

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:15.890
Unfortunately…

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:18.727
<i>What's this?</i>

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.771
<i>His cursed energy is rising.</i>

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:26.151
I'll start working overtime.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:29.612
<i>Overtime?</i>

00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:32.115
<i>Time-related constraints?</i>

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:36.036
<i>Was he limiting his cursed energy?</i>

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.538
This is interesting!

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.836
My cursed technique
is to force the seven to three ratio

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:49.924
into weakness when dividing
the enemy into equal parts.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.929
<i>Not only the height and limbs
can be divided equally,</i>

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.558
<i>but I can also use it on the head, body,</i>

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:02.604
<i>upper arm, forearm, and so on.</i>

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.693
<i>And my cursed technique
works on non-creatures as well.</i>

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.155
<i>Is he disclosing his cursed technique?</i>

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:13.948
I guess you're serious.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.037
<i>-The methods to kill this Curse Spirit…</i>
-Playing…

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.915
<i>-that I can think of now is…</i>
-tag again?

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.878
<i>One, continue to inflict damage
until it runs out of cursed energy.</i>

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.339
<i>But it's unrealistic.</i>

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.174
<i>Another way…</i>

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.636
<i>is to blow it into pieces in one blow!</i>

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.931
Ratio Technique, Collapse!

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:41.351
<i>What amazing power.</i>

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.393
<i>No, wait a minute.</i>

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.063
<i>His cursed energy dissipated.
Could it be that…</i>

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:50.068
<i>It's an expanded cursed technique that
injects cursed energy into his target!</i>

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.904
<i>It's an attack that hits both of us.</i>

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.739
<i>I guess I should…</i>

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.575
…evade it.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:03.039
I'll retreat temporarily.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.501
You better fix your leg
as soon as possible.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:10.797
Let's meet again if we both stay alive.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.259
What?

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.858 line:20%
That's strange.
Did the earth shake for a while just now?

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.903 line:20%
Yes, it felt like
a magnitude two earthquake.

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:02.909
No good. Mr. Ijichi isn't picking up.

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.121
-Can I ask him already?
-What?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:11.042
<i>Actually, is it a good idea
to be honest with him?</i>

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.837
<i>Speaking of which, how much can I
explain about Jujutsu High School?</i>

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.300
<i>The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.</i>

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:20.551
Answer it!

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:24.931
Wait!

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.059
What should I do?

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.937
<i>A vortex button?</i>

00:04:31.562 --> 00:04:32.647
That's right.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.109
If you meet a student
with a vortex button,

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:37.694
you should be nice to them.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.196
They are Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.240
You'll get along with them.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:47.620
<i>But Jujutsu Sorcerers
are Mahito's enemies, right?</i>

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.999
Forget it! I'll just ask!

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:55.044
Hey, someone died in the cinema
you went to before.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:57.297
Did you see anything?

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.299
Like this gross thing, for example.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.926
No, I didn't see it.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.722
I only started to
see these things recently.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.515
I see.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.851
All right, I have nothing else to ask.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.019
That quick?

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:15.148
But you still have to wait
for someone who's like my boss.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:16.274
Is that fine?

00:05:16.357 --> 00:05:17.525
Okay.

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:20.611
Hey.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.655
What did you watch in the cinema?

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.409
It's a rereleased old movie.
You wouldn't know.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.244
Just tell me.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.955
<i>The Human Centipede 3.</i>

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.623
That one is so boring!

00:05:32.707 --> 00:05:35.501
I got beaten several times
because of that.

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:37.336
Beaten?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.297
Gosh.

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:41.841
But it's a violent movie.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:45.845
Maybe we shouldn't ask for
anything other than a bloody scene.

00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:49.515
-But the second installation--
-The second installation was interesting!

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.643
Yes, that's right!

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.188
Only the second installation is enjoyable.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.356
-Enjoy?
-Jackpot.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.151
Have you seen the whole series?

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:06.616
<i>The second movie looks the same
as the first and third movies,</i>

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.870
<i>but it gives a detailed
emotional description on</i>

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.039
<i>how a perfectionist gives up on himself.</i>

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:14.791
Mother.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.169
<i>No wonder the second movie was good!</i>

00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:19.462
Why?

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:23.216
I didn't understand
why it was interesting at first,

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.051
so I watched it three times.

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:27.220
The second movie
was the most gruesome too,

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.888
so it was hard for me.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.224
Why would you go that far?

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:34.811
Do you like movies, Itadori?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.356
I've been watching it lately
for some reason,

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:41.484
but I didn't watch it in a cinema.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:42.527
I see.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.405
But when you watch interesting films
in a cinema, it feels really touching.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.658
Although video on demand
is more convenient.

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.244
When was the last time I went there?

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.413
If you have a movie suggestion,
bring me along next time.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.790
What?

00:06:55.873 --> 00:06:57.291
Do you want my contact number?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.085
Here.

00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:04.006
How do I add friends on this again?

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.800
What? Is that you, Junpei?

00:07:06.467 --> 00:07:07.885
Mother!

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.389
It's rare to find you here.
Is he your friend?

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.266
I just met him.

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.270
We just met, but we can be friends!

00:07:17.353 --> 00:07:20.440
Really? Please play with him more.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.025
-Mother!
-What?

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.444
Cigarettes.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.780
Didn't I tell you not to smoke?

00:07:29.073 --> 00:07:30.366
I'm sorry.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.202
We agreed not to smoke in front of you.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.581
What's your friend's name?

00:07:36.664 --> 00:07:38.166
I'm Yuji Itadori!

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.460
Ma'am, the green onions don't suit you.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.878
Wow, you can tell?

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.589
My goal is to become a woman
who doesn't suit green onions.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.340
What are you saying?

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.675
How about it, Yuji?

00:07:47.758 --> 00:07:49.218
Want to come over for dinner?

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.304
Hey! You're causing trouble for him!

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:53.806
What? Is it troublesome to eat my cooking?

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.057
ZOOMING

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.894
GROWLING

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.272
Is there anything you don't like?
What about allergies?

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:02.231
None at all!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:13.993
What?

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:24.545
Unlike his appearance,
he's really reckless!

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:27.924
-You had a great fight.
-Geto!

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:31.344
That guy was interesting.
I've learned a lot.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:32.553
Is that so?

00:08:32.637 --> 00:08:37.767
Even if I'm crushed, I won't die
if I maintain the shape of my soul.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.521
Consuming cursed energy
is also a type of self-sufficiency.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:47.068
And no matter how I change my soul,
there's no risk at all.

00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.946
I'll try something bolder next time.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.198
Geto, give me clothes.

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.658
No.

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:55.952
Where's the Jujutsu Sorcerer
who fought with you?

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:59.205
I have no idea.
He said he's going to retreat for a while.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:00.831
Maybe he's still under the rubble.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.000
What?

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.002
You're going to Junpei Yoshino's house?

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.588
-That's…
<i>-It's okay.</i>

00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:10.967
<i>-I'm going to have dinner.</i>
-Dinner?

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.927
I'll come right away.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.972
If something feels wrong,
please get out of there.

00:09:17.181 --> 00:09:22.019
<i>Even if Junpei Yoshino
was the perpetrator of this incident,</i>

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:26.190
<i>the current Itadori
won't be killed so easily.</i>

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:31.153
<i>But this is my negligence
as his supervisor.</i>

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:33.489
<i>Let's not talk about
the carefree Mr. Gojo.</i>

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.492
<i>If I get scolded by Mr. Kento,
the most mature man ever,</i>

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.453
<i>I might cry.</i>

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.038
Let's hurry up!

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:44.166 line:20%
I don't want to cry in front of others
at this age!

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:47.670
CALLING
KENTO NANAMI

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.839
He called earlier than I expected!

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.257
I'm going to get scolded!

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.092
<i>Yes, I'm sorry.</i>

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:54.218
What?

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:58.639
I sent you my location just now,
please pick me up.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:02.935
I'll go back to Jujutsu High School
and find Ms. Ieiri for treatment.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.770
<i>Treatment?</i>

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:08.149
I'm okay. It's not fatal.

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:09.942
That's great.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.446
I'll meet up with Itadori first
and find you after.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:15.781
<i>Aren't you together?</i>

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.659
<i>I'm such a fool.</i>

00:10:24.498 --> 00:10:26.751
<i>I practiced it many times.</i>

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:30.129
Your body is perfect for experimentation.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.506
I'm so lucky.

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:38.054
<i>That Cursed Spirit is just a kid.</i>

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.642
<i>It probably hasn't been long
since he manifested.</i>

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.936 line:20%
<i>He grew up greedily and enjoyed it.</i>

00:10:46.896 --> 00:10:49.523
<i>The Special Grade Cursed Spirit
that fought with Mr. Gojo</i>

00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:52.652
<i>has learned Domain Expansion.</i>

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.446
<i>If that Cursed Spirit is still alive,</i>

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.282
<i>it won't take long
for him to be this strong.</i>

00:10:58.949 --> 00:11:02.536
<i>Furthermore, the number of victims
is far beyond our expectations.</i>

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.331 line:20%
Help me.

00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:08.542
<i>We must exorcise him as soon as possible.</i>

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.129
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:18.844
And then?

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.056
And then Takashi said this confidently.

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.683
This is an alien larva!

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.060
It might be poisonous.

00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:27.728
Don't touch it, everyone!

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:29.814
And when I picked it up,

00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:32.608 line:20%
it was just the konjac strip
from our lunch!

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.779
Did you hear that? It's a konjac strip!

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:39.698
-Mother, you drank too much.
-Itadori, you're hilarious!

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:42.326
Here, make a joke with this.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.453
<i>This drunkard is horrible.</i>

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.164
Wilson!

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:51.335
-Forgive me, Wilson!
-That's from <i>Cast Away</i>, right?

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.837
Correct!

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.255
I don't understand.

00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:55.548
Is it a movie joke?

00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:58.008
It's fire!

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:11.439
Your mother is a good person.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:14.066
She is.

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.403
School?

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:23.659
-Isn't it fine? Just don't go.
-What?

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:28.122
Boys your age tend to overthink things.

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:31.709
The school is just a small aquarium.

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:36.714
There are seas and other larger aquariums.

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:38.132
Choose what you like.

00:12:38.215 --> 00:12:41.635
I say some nice things!

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:44.889
That's a great quote!
As expected of myself!

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.646
What kind of person is your mom?

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.814
Well…

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.441
I've never seen her before,

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.402
and I have a vague memory about my father.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.155
But I do have a grandfather.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:05.743
Sorry, I got a call.

00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:07.912
Hello, Mr. Ijichi?

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:10.498
Yes, I'm okay.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.710
We're going to watch a movie.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.462
Yes.

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:18.964
-I'll see you in two hours.
<i>-Two hours--</i>

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:23.010
You're a Jujutsu Sorcerer, right, Itadori?

00:13:23.093 --> 00:13:24.053
Yes.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:26.597
<i>Should I have said that?</i>

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:30.476
-Have you ever killed anyone?
-What?

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.686
No.

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:37.733
But you'll need to fight
with other bad Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.860
What will you do then?

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:43.739
Even so, I don't want to kill anyone.

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.492
Why not? They are bad people.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:48.285
How should I put it?

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.120
If I kill once,

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:54.500
the option of killing
will appear in my life.

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:57.211
The value of life becomes ambiguous.

00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:00.339
I won't understand the value
of someone important to me.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.883
I'm scared of that.

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:09.014
<i>"A human has no heart."</i>

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.767
<i>I was saved by this idea.</i>

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.020
<i>He gave me strength.</i>

00:14:15.729 --> 00:14:21.902
<i>However, if the soul is stained
because I killed someone…</i>

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.074
<i>I can't…</i>

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:28.742
<i>kill anyone.</i>

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:37.835
Gosh, I fell asleep.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.462
Has Yuji gone back?

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:43.632
Oh, no, it's already so late!
I need to clean up.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:45.509
What?

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.177 line:20%
What's this?

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.973 line:20%
A finger?

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:02.401
<i>After the incident
at Satozakura High School,</i>

00:15:02.484 --> 00:15:07.281
<i>Junpei Yoshino found her mother,
Nagi Yoshino's body,</i>

00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:10.784
<i>and Sukuna's left pinky finger at home.</i>

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:13.871
<i>It was believed that Nagi Yoshino
was attacked by</i>

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:16.415
<i>a Cursed Spirit
that was attracted to the finger.</i>

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:19.919
<i>Part of her lower body was missing.</i>

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:23.881
<i>No bloodstains were found at the scene.</i>

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.302
<i>Nagi Yoshino's body was found
lying in the bedroom.</i>

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:31.513
<i>When the blanket was taken off,</i>

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.683
<i>there were refrigerants
and ice packs all over the body.</i>

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.938
Do you think I'll hold you back, Nanami?

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.608
You got hurt! Bring me along next time.

00:15:43.776 --> 00:15:47.446
<i>"My comrade died, but I wasn't there."</i>

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.616
<i>"Because I'm still a kid."
How can I say that?</i>

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:56.330
You're strong enough to save others.

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:59.792
I don't want to say that.

00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:01.126
No.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:06.757
As you know, that stitched-face
Cursed Spirit uses transfigured humans.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.053
<i>There are hopeless people in the world.</i>

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.847
As long as you're doing this job,

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:17.518
you'll encounter someone
that must be killed someday.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:20.729
But now's not the time.

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.524
Even so, I don't want to kill anyone.

00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.317
I'm scared of that.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:28.988
Please understand.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:32.616
Being a child is never a sin.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:37.329
Please keep an eye on Junpei Yoshino.

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:46.088
<i>I don't have black clothes,
so I opened my mother's wardrobe</i>

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:49.216
<i>and grabbed the first
black pair of clothes I could find.</i>

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.970
<i>I breathed in the familiar morning air,</i>

00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:55.848
<i>and took the usual path to school.</i>

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:57.850
<i>Today…</i>

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:02.354
This is Sukuna.

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:04.565
It's a cursed object that attracts curses.

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:07.568
Why did this thing appear at my house?

00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:11.238 line:20%
There are many Curse Users
who earn money by cursing people.

00:17:11.321 --> 00:17:13.574
I guess they did it.

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:18.454
You can kill someone with a curse
as long as you have the way and money.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:20.581
Does someone come to mind?

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:23.459
A person that hates you and your mother.

00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:30.257
<i>Or a shady person who's rich and free.</i>

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.426
<i>Certificate of Recommendation.</i>

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.347
The top prize in the National Book Report
Competition goes to…

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.308
Shota Ito.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.351
-One, two.
-One, two.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:44.021
-Shota!
-Shota!

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:48.942
This is making me embarrassed.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.198
I'm glad that our student…

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:56.909
-can receive such an honorable award.
-What are you doing?

00:17:56.992 --> 00:18:01.330
Didn't I tell you to write casually?
It even won the best award.

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:03.332
-I hope everyone can develop…
-Want to die?

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.292
I'm sorry.

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:08.337
And you're only shortlisted.

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.216
Shota is really cool.

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.384
-Right?
-Really?

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:16.929
It's not bad that he's a rich kid.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:18.013
What?

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.015
What's that black thing?

00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:21.850
What? Where?

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.689
"Emerge from darkness,
that which is darker than black."

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.526
"Purify this impurity."

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:38.867
It's a success.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:40.536
I'm sorry, Mahito.

00:18:40.619 --> 00:18:43.580
I can't leave any residuals behind.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:45.499
What's the use of Veil?

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:50.212
It prevents anyone
within the area from leaving.

00:18:50.295 --> 00:18:53.382
But it's limited to humans
with weak cursed energy.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:56.677
It's an unannounced Veil
that appears in the residential area.

00:18:57.177 --> 00:18:59.721
The windows will report it soon.

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:03.267
I hope the situation you wish for
comes true.

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:06.103
It should work out.

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:10.607
<i>The moment Junpei met Sukuna's vessel,</i>

00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:12.568
<i>luck was already on our side.</i>

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.154
<i>Let them fight.</i>

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.406
<i>Then I'll force Yuji Itadori
into a Binding Vow,</i>

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:20.075
<i>which will assert
Sukuna's superiority over him.</i>

00:19:20.159 --> 00:19:23.579
If only Jogo was as levelheaded as you…

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:26.331
His straightforward personality
is quite cute.

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:27.916
In any case, is it really okay?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.836
Isn't the finger precious?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.421
It's okay.

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:37.050
The finger in the detention center
was quickly absorbed by Yuji Itadori.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:41.722
I want Jujutsu High School to take
the one left in Junpei Yoshino's house.

00:19:41.805 --> 00:19:43.265
Really?

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.474
Is that a conspiracy?

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:45.726
I guess you can say that.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.604
Well then, I'll get going.

00:19:48.687 --> 00:19:49.563
What?

00:19:49.646 --> 00:19:50.814
You're leaving?

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.816
You should watch too, Geto.

00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:55.027
It will definitely be fun…

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:59.823
watching the demise of foolish children.

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.035
Hey!

00:20:03.118 --> 00:20:04.203
What's wrong, everyone?

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:06.663
Pull yourself together. Are you okay?

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.333
They won't die.

00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.500
What?

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:12.628
Yoshino?

00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:14.421
Why?

00:20:14.504 --> 00:20:15.380
No.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.842 line:20%
Do you know what's happening?

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:23.305 line:20%
Take a closer look, Mr. Sotomura.

00:20:24.473 --> 00:20:26.516
You… Those scars…

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:28.977
That's…

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.063
The things that have happened so far

00:20:31.146 --> 00:20:33.357
and the things that will happen…

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:35.359
Yoshino…

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.780
I have something to ask you.

00:20:39.863 --> 00:20:43.784 line:20%
Did you put that thing in my house?

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:46.328
What are you talking about--

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:52.709
What's going on?

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.211
What did you do?

00:20:55.128 --> 00:20:57.172
This isn't getting anywhere.

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:03.679
Do you think you can answer
questions with questions?

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:06.390
You're going to die

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:09.518
regardless of your answer!

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:12.896
Because I can't tell if you're lying.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.441
Besides, you're guilty for
what you've done to me!

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:20.654
Let me see your sincerity
at your last moment.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.324
I'm sorry…

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.285 line:20%
And then?

00:21:29.329 --> 00:21:30.497
So?

00:21:33.542 --> 00:21:34.418
What?

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:42.592
What are you doing, Junpei?

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.432
Step aside, Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:24.277
<i>The floor plan's good,
but a three-burner stove portends death.</i>

00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:27.030
<i>Burn, Mount Hiei!
Matsutake for aroma! Shimeji for flavor!</i>

00:23:27.114 --> 00:23:30.117
<i>Signs of autumn are disappearing
along with your loved ones' tears!</i>

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.119
<i>Next time,
episode 12 of</i> Jujutsu Kaisen!

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:34.121
<i>"Bloodshed Autumn Leaf-viewing."</i>

00:23:34.204 --> 00:23:35.872
<i>What's being hunted is your heart.</i>
