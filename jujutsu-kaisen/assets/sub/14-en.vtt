WEBVTT

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.857
Oh, there you are!

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.858
What?

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.070
Jogo!

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.995
Seems like your body
is almost completely restored.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.498
Yes, it's comfortable to live here.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:42.917
No humans can come close.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.879
I guess it's really inconvenient
when you don't have a body.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.631
Self-regeneration
is really inefficient, too.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.883
Mahito.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.178
Seems like you used up
a lot of cursed energy as well.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:55.138
Oh, you can tell?

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.892
Ryomen Sukuna and his vessel
are my nemesis.

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.980
<i>This game started when I met my new toy,</i>

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.816
but it didn't go well.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.359
It wasn't bad at first, though.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.406
I should have taken the toy hostage,
and forced Itadori to make a Binding Vow.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.119
If you don't want him to die,
hand over your body to Sukuna.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:24.125
No, a Binding Vow
can only be done by himself.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:28.505
It's not that simple to initiate
a Binding Vow through intervention.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.884
<i>Maybe it would have been better</i>

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.762
<i>if I just gave him a fatal blow
instead of transfiguring him.</i>

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.557
<i>Maybe Sukuna could have treated him
with his Reverse Cursed Technique.</i>

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.896
Know your place, you fool.

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:50.777
No, that's how he is.
He'll refuse no matter what.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.321
Jogo.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.157
After coming in contact with Sukuna,

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.327
I think it's better
to follow Geto's plan first.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.705 line:20%
Sukuna is worth the effort.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.879
<i>Collect all fingers
and offer it to Sukuna?</i>

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.551 line:20%
It doesn't matter
if we all die in the process.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:16.928 line:20%
Right?

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.472
Very well.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.560
It doesn't have to be me smiling
in the wilderness 100 years later.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.896
I'm fine with it,
as long as curses live as humans.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.399
Oh, you get it.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:34.028
So let's collect all six fingers
kept by Jujutsu High School.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.363
Is that necessary?

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:39.617
Jujutsu Sorcerers keep Yuji Itadori
because they want him

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.369
to swallow Sukuna's fingers, right?

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:43.663
Even if we ignore him,
he'll eat it by himself.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.623
The higher-ups of Jujutsu High

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:49.627
still can't judge
Yuji Itadori's strength as a vessel.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.714
They don't know how many fingers it takes
for him to lose control.

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:56.551
They will probably gather all the fingers
before making him swallow all at once.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.596
Although there's one exception.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.682
I want him to eat it quickly!

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.976
We can't wait that long, right?

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.397
In a worst-case scenario,
the higher-ups might kill Yuji Itadori.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.442
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.111
What should we do?

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:16.863
I've made the arrangements.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:21.868
That's why I let Jujutsu High School
gather the fingers I collected.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:05.471 line:20%
Nanami, tell me something interesting.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.808
All right, I got it!

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.353
Let's play catch with scrap rice balls

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:14.564
and discuss secularism!

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:17.108
Then I'll upload a video on it.
It will be so popular!

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.570
Go and have fun on your own.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.822
<i>What kind of idea is that?</i>

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:29.037
Let's play Yamanote Line game
at Satoru Gojo's favorite location!

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.039
<i>All</i>

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.500
Please keep it up.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:39.047
Itadori needs your stupidity now.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:43.593
I'll let you complete a few big missions.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.848
That wasn't what I meant
when I said "big."

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:50.558
Nanami.

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:53.186
Did you tell Yuji about
the finger in Yoshino's house--

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.729
I didn't tell him.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:58.149
He will probably
blame himself unnecessarily.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:00.860
I'm glad I left this up to you.

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.653
So where's the finger?

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:06.324
I've handed it over to the superiors.

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:09.952
If I give it to you,
you'll let Itadori eat it, right?

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:14.665
But are you really letting him
return to the team?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.877
If you announce it at the Goodwill Event,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.379
he'll be targeted by the higher-ups again.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.174
Even so, I believe Yuji will be fine.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.052
You should know it well.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:28.346
What?

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.056
Mr. Gojo!

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.476
Nanami is here too.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.477
Hey!

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.979
Let's go meet them now.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:38.523
I'm excited!

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:39.774
I'm excited!

00:06:39.857 --> 00:06:42.026
I'm excited!

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.194
Yuji.

00:06:43.277 --> 00:06:44.403
Don't tell me that

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.657
you've been hiding for so long,
and now you want to appear normally?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.200
Can't I?

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:52.161
For a dead friend
to reappear after two months

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.038
saying they were alive…

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.290
Even Jujutsu Sorcerers
don't get that often.

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:58.251
You should give them a surprise.

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.588
In short, just leave it to me.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:03.631 line:20%
What?

00:07:06.634 --> 00:07:09.720
<i>The first-year students will be
shocked, happy, crying, and laughing.</i>

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:12.223 line:20%
<i>The second-year
and Kyoto's students will cry as well.</i>

00:07:12.306 --> 00:07:15.268 line:20%
<i>Some will cry until they vomit!</i>

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:19.689
<i>They will cry so much that
even global warming will be resolved!</i>

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:23.943
Nice!

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:25.278
What should I do?

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:27.447
Mr. Gojo, what should I do?

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.073
You don't have to do anything.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.950
Just do as I say.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.535
Just go along with my plan.

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:34.454
So what should I do to follow your plan?

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.707
-<i>You being alive is already a surprise.</i>
-Just flow along with me.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.916
Why…

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.919
Why is everyone all empty-handed?

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:43.087
-What?
-What?

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:45.423
That's our question.
What's with all the luggage?

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:48.426
I mean we're going to Kyoto, right?

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:51.929
The Sister-School Goodwill Event in Kyoto.

00:07:52.013 --> 00:07:55.266
It's a Sister-School Goodwill Event
with the Kyoto School…

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:56.309 line:20%
held in Tokyo.

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:57.435 line:20%
FAMOUS IN UENO
PANDA

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.896
No way!

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.065
-No wonder I've always felt weird.
-What am I preparing for?

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:04.859
-Yes.
-Salmon.

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:07.904
-It's held by last year's winner.
-This is too much! It's a fraud!

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.947
Don't go winning, idiot!

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.241
We didn't compete last year!

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:15.453
Yuta was the only one who joined
last year to make up for the numbers.

00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:17.413
That was before Rika was freed.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:19.540
<i>I heard that he dominated the competition.</i>

00:08:19.624 --> 00:08:21.751
<i>But it was held in Kyoto,
so we didn't see it.</i>

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.046
I won't forgive you, Yuta Okkotsu!

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:27.632
Although I've never met you before!

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:29.091
That's unjustified resentment.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:30.426
-Salmon.
-What?

00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.432
Hey. They are here.

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:38.392
Oh, my.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.562
Everyone from the Tokyo school is here.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.274
Are you here to greet us?

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:47.276
It's really disgusting.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.278
MAI ZENIN
SECOND-YEAR STUDENT

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.781
Okkotsu is not here.

AOI TODO
THIRD-YEAR STUDENT

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:56.744
Shut up and give me those boxes of cakes.

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:59.080
<i>Yatsuhashi, kuzukiri,</i>
and buckwheat biscuits, too!

00:08:59.163 --> 00:09:00.122
Salmon.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:01.791
Are you guys hungry?

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.834
What's wrong with that first-year student?

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:04.794
It's terrifying.

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.796
MOMO NISHIMIYA
THIRD-YEAR STUDENT

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.006
It's good that Okkotsu is not here,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.133
but two first-years
is too much of a handicap.

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.301
It's a robot!

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:14.303
ULTIMATE MECHAMARU
SECOND-YEAR STUDENT

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:17.306
A Jujutsu Sorcerer's strength
has nothing to do with age.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.308
NORITOSHI KAMO
THIRD-YEAR STUDENT

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.310
Especially Fushiguro.

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:24.313
He's from the bloodline
of the Zenin Family.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.774
He's much better
than the main family bloodline.

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:27.775
Damn it.

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:28.943
What's wrong?

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:30.027
Nothing.

00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:31.237
Hey there, you guys.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.155
You two should calm down.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.157 line:20%
KASUMI MIWA
SECOND-YEAR STUDENT

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:39.078
Come on. Don't quarrel among ourselves.

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.539
You kids…

00:09:41.622 --> 00:09:43.541 line:20%
UTAHIME IORI
SEMI-GRADE 1 JUJUTSU SORCERER

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:46.043
So where's that fool?

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:47.670
Satoru is late.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.464
There's no way a fool
is going to be on time.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.509
Nobody said that fool is Mr. Gojo.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.552
-What?
-What?

00:09:57.597 --> 00:09:59.473
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:00.433
Damn it.

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:01.976
-Satoru Gojo.
<i>-Satoru Gojo!</i>

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.313
Hey, everyone's here!

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:08.357
I went on a business trip abroad.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.943
So I brought some souvenirs for everyone.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:12.361
That's sudden.

00:10:12.445 --> 00:10:13.946
Isn't it because of his jet lag?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.948
-Here's for everyone from Kyoto.
-What?

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:17.700
An amulet of a certain tribe.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.035
None for Utahime.

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.202
I don't want it!

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.331
And this is a local product
for everyone from Tokyo!

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.710
Overly-excited adults are creepy.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:34.216
Yes! OPP!

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.011
This is Yuji Itadori,
who was presumed dead!

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.016
What?

00:10:42.099 --> 00:10:43.142
What?

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:44.518
What?

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.480
They don't look happy at all!

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:49.607
No way…

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.776
Hello, everyone from Kyoto.

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:55.112
This is Ryomen Sukuna's vessel,
Yuji Itadori.

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.489
<i>The Kyoto students…</i>

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.076
<i>They are only interested in the dolls!</i>

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:04.205
Sukuna's vessel?

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:06.499
What's going on?

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.501
YOSHINOBU GAKUGANJI
PRINCIPAL

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:09.502
What?

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:11.504
Principal Gakuganji!

00:11:11.587 --> 00:11:14.507
My, I'm so glad!

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:19.845 line:20%
I was worried that
you were going to die from shock.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.015
<i>Curse you, brat!</i>

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:29.397
Hey.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.773
Yes?

00:11:30.856 --> 00:11:32.983
There's something you should say, right?

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:33.901
What?

00:11:37.988 --> 00:11:43.077
I'm sorry for not telling you
that I'm still alive.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.955
ITADORI JOINS THE FRAY

00:11:56.048 --> 00:12:00.010
TOKYO-KYOTO
SISTER-SCHOOL GOODWILL EVENT

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:02.555
The Tokyo-Kyoto
Sister-School Goodwill Event

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:05.349
will be held across two days.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:08.227
First day, we'll have a team battle.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:10.980
WACKY SPIRIT BASH RACE

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:14.567
It's the Wacky Spirit Bash Race!

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:18.320
<i>The rules are simple.</i>

00:12:18.863 --> 00:12:22.116
<i>The team who eliminates
the Grade 2 Cursed Spirit</i>

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.077
<i>released within the school grounds wins!</i>

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.206
<i>Grade 3 and below Cursed Spirits
have been released, too.</i>

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.834
<i>If there's no winner before sunset,</i>

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:35.463
<i>the winner is decided
by the number of eliminations.</i>

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.965
<i>There are no other rules.</i>

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:41.427
You may hinder your opponents in the race,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.514
but don't forget that you are comrades
in the fight against the curses.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.601
The Goodwill Event
is for you to understand

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.978
your comrades and yourself
in the competition.

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:53.355
Please don't kill each other.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:57.568
Don't cause irreparable damage
to your opponent.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.615
All right, you are all dismissed.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:03.991
The race will begin at noon!

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.412 line:20%
TOKYO SCHOOL TEAM MEETING

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:10.080 line:20%
<i>Excuse me.</i>

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:13.000
We're comrades.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.920
This kind of bullying
seems a bit excessive.

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:18.130
Shut up.
Keep it like that for the time being.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.381
Come on, now.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:23.135
He has explained the reason.
Just forgive him.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.845
The panda spoke!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.430
Salmon.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:27.806
What?

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.434
Inumaki is
a Cursed Speech Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:34.271
His cursed technique enhances and
forcefully activates the effects of words.

00:13:34.355 --> 00:13:37.358
He limits his vocabulary
for safety purposes.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:40.277 line:20%
If you tell someone to die,
will that person really die?

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.570
Impressive.

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:43.989
It's not as convenient as you think.

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:47.034 line:20%
It depends on
the strength of the sorcerer.

00:13:47.117 --> 00:13:50.412 line:20%
Using strong vocabulary
will get a strong rebound,

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.831 line:20%
and it rebounds to himself at worst.

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:57.086 line:20%
So the vocabulary restriction
is also to protect himself.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.504
I see.

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.298 line:20%
So why can you talk?

00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:02.716
Are you a new breed of panda?

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.135
How could he reveal
someone else's cursed technique?

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:06.220
It's okay.

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:08.472
It won't matter
if Toge's technique is revealed.

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:11.600
-Anyway, Yuji…
-What?

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:13.602
Give me back the Slaughter Demon.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:15.896
<i>Satoru lent it to you, right?</i>

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:19.942 line:20%
Well…

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:23.279
Lend me.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:24.989
Here you go.

00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:28.534
I broke it.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.244
Give it back.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:35.749
It's with Mr. Gojo.

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.419
That stupid blindfolded man!

00:14:38.502 --> 00:14:39.837
Really?

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.258
That's disgusting.

00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:46.552
So what's the plan?

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:49.763
We expected a team battle,

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.682
but our members have increased.

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:53.976
Changing our battle strategy?
There's no time.

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:55.185
Bonito flakes.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.188
That depends on Yuji. What can you do?

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.024
I can punch and kick.

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:03.986
-There are enough people who can do that.
-What?

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:08.532
I don't know what this guy
did while he was dead,

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:10.868
but if Tokyo and Kyoto School students

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:13.662
fight without cursed energy…

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.206
Itadori will win.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.750
Wow.

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:21.545
<i>Megumi has fought Aoi before,</i>

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:24.173
<i>so he's credible.</i>

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.383
Interesting.

00:15:30.054 --> 00:15:31.221 line:20%
KYOTO SCHOOL TEAM MEETING

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.432 line:20%
<i>Sukuna's vessel…</i>

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.769
Kill Yuji Itadori.

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:38.854
That is not a human.

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.190
You can do whatever.

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.150
I'll treat it as an accident.

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.861
No need to worry or hesitate.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.863
<i>How unpleasant.</i>

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.949
Regardless of whether
we can kill him or not,

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.868
he's here because he can't die, right?

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:56.872
I heard that he committed suicide.

00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:01.835
What do you need to pay attention to
when killing a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:02.962
Kamo.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:03.879
Yes.

00:16:04.463 --> 00:16:07.299
To prevent Jujutsu Sorcerers
from becoming curses after death,

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:08.884
we kill them with cursed energy.

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.344
That's right.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:14.932
There will be no problem
if you kill him with cursed energy.

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:18.894
Now Yuji Itadori
has control over the body.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.272
As long as Sukuna doesn't appear,
he's just a normal first-year student.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:23.857
It's easy to kill--

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.528
Lame. Do as you like.

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:29.029
Todo, come back.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:32.032
The principal is not finished yet.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:36.704
Takada will make a guest appearance
on the 11:00 a.m. walking show.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:39.039
Do I need to explain further?

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.917
Just record the show. Come back.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:45.045
I want to watch both the premiere
and the recording!

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.297
Are you looking down on me?

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:50.884
<i>That's not the point.</i>

00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:52.678
Listen carefully.

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.596
You too, old man!

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.601
I've long been disappointed
in everyone's poor taste in women.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:02.604
Just use whatever strategy you want.

00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.108
However, try giving me another order…

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.693
I'll kill you.

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:13.323
What should we do?

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:17.327
It seems that he's not going to
participate in our battle strategy.

00:17:17.411 --> 00:17:19.705
The principal is gone too.

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:22.791
To be honest,
I don't want to be killed by him.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.835
It should be okay.

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:28.714
That guy's going to fight
the Tokyo guys either way.

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:30.883
Since he wants to go rampant,

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.761
we just need to focus on the game.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:37.723
But we have to kill Yuji Itadori.

00:17:37.806 --> 00:17:39.475
<i>Are we really killing him?</i>

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:43.353
I don't think he's going to kill him.

00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:45.189
Although it looks like he might.

00:17:45.272 --> 00:17:47.900
Then we have to keep an eye on Todo,

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:51.779
and deal a fatal blow to Yuji Itadori.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:53.572
<i>I don't want to do it.</i>

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.242
Since we have to deal
with Cursed Spirits too,

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:58.994
I think two on one is just right.

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.621
No.

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:03.582
Among the Jujutsu Sorcerers
of Jujutsu High School,

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:07.211
the appearance of a half-baked person
like Yuji Itadori is extremely serious.

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:09.630
Regardless of the Goodwill Event,

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:12.758
I can't turn a blind eye
as a member of Kamo Family.

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:17.971
Everyone from Kyoto School
will attack Yuji Itadori.

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.598
Wait a minute.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:23.560
What if Itadori and Inumaki are together?

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:26.814
<i>It's too risky for us
since his Cursed Speech</i>

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.482
<i>can take us all out at once.</i>

00:18:28.565 --> 00:18:31.443
<i>At worst, we might get wiped out.</i>

00:18:32.152 --> 00:18:34.071
She's right.

00:18:34.571 --> 00:18:39.076
No, it's not that scary
since we know his technique.

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:41.286
I'll take care of Maki.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.580
Give me that brown-haired
first-year student too.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.165
Listen to what you say.

00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.167
You're acting like Todo.

00:18:49.837 --> 00:18:52.464
So what do you want to talk about?

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:54.883
What? Why are you angry?

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:57.386
I'm not angry.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:19:00.931
That's right. I didn't do anything.

00:19:01.974 --> 00:19:04.059 line:20%
Someone in Jujutsu High School…

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:07.396 line:20%
is colluding with
Cursed Users or Cursed Spirits.

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:09.731
Impossible!

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.192
I can understand Cursed Users,
but Cursed Spirits?

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:16.238
Recently, Cursed Spirits
of that level keep emerging.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:20.284
<i>They not only understand words,
but can even act in a group.</i>

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:21.994
<i>That person may think</i>

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.329
<i>they are just colluding with Cursed Users.</i>

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:28.292
So I want you to help me
investigate the Kyoto campus.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.296
What if I'm the mole?

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:33.797
That's impossible.

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:36.425
You're weak, and you don't have the guts--

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:40.220
You're terrifying.

00:19:40.304 --> 00:19:44.391
-No man likes a fierce woman!
-I'm your senior!

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:49.897
Itadori.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.814
What?

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:52.441
Are you okay?

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:53.400
Yes.

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:56.236
Seems like I've got a big role,
but there'll always be a way.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.905
I'm not talking about that.

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.239
Something happened, right?

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.241
Nothing happened.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:05.746
Something did happen.

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:10.459
<i>But I'm really fine.</i>

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:15.214
In fact, I don't want to lose
because of that.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.716
Good.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.136
I kind of don't want to lose, either.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.013
What do you mean "kind of"?

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:25.057
You were knocked out before.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.768
It will be a complete victory!
Let's beat them up!

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.228
For Maki's sake, too!

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:30.687
Don't say that.

00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.022
Spicy cod roe!

00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:34.233
Yes, for the sake of Maki!

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.068
I said, stop it!

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:39.780
Well then…

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:41.740
To victory!

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.868
Why are you taking charge?

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:45.953
What?

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.503
<i>Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:21.548 line:20%
SUSHI EISHU

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.050
All right!

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:27.554
Today, we're here at Sushi Eishu.

00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:30.140
Why don't you try acting like her?

00:22:30.223 --> 00:22:33.018
I would, but you would scold me!

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.021 line:20%
Welcome.

00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:51.369
What do you like, Takada?

00:22:51.453 --> 00:22:53.163
I like blood clams.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:56.583
It's a perfect match
with room temperature sake!

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:57.709
How old are you again?

00:22:57.793 --> 00:22:58.835
What did you say?

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.467
How many years
have you been in this business?

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.844
I started when I was 20 years old.

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.596
Let me count.

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.349
Did you start the business 300 years ago?

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:13.809
Are you drunk?

00:23:14.392 --> 00:23:16.812
Thank you for waiting.
Here's your blood clam sushi.

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:22.984
It's delicious!

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:24.778
Can I have yours?

00:23:24.861 --> 00:23:26.321
Of course not.

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:31.576
<i>-I'm sorry.
-What are you thinking?</i>

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.162
<i>-It looks really delicious.</i>
-It's not bad.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.331
-As expected of Takada.
<i>-This is fun!</i>

00:23:36.998 --> 00:23:39.459
Mr. Gojo, do you know what OPP means?

00:23:39.543 --> 00:23:41.545
What? It has a meaning?

00:23:41.628 --> 00:23:45.382
-It stands for "Ocean Pacific Peace."
-Are you serious?
