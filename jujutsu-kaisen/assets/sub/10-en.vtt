00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.554 line:20%
Wait, there are five sequels
to <i>The Super Scream Project?</i>

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.556
There are seven of them.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.810
Really? I think the seventh installation
of this series will be shocking.

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:22.021
The seventh installation feels
totally different.

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:24.065
It's not even a movie parody.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.192
Then what movie is that?

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.527
Well…

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.320
A sloppy sitcom

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.406
plus family horror, I guess?

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.699
What does that mean?

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.784
The grandson of the owner
in the first movie,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.078
the grandson of the prisoner
in the second movie,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:41.666
and the grandson of the first person
who died in the third movie lived together

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.209
for some reason.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.003
The house turned out to be haunted,

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.714
so they invited a psychic to the house.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.716
It sounds boring.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:51.968
It's boring to death.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.845
Who would want to see this?

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:57.557
But what's interesting is that
the ones in the fifth and sixth movies--

00:00:58.183 --> 00:00:59.350
What?

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:01.102
Why are you here?

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:05.607
Didn't we tell you not to use it
since we're using it as our club room?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.941
But…

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:11.321
You haven't used it lately,
I thought you don't need it anymore.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.160
So?

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.788
No, I mean…

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.959
Just get out of here, you cockroaches!

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.545
Let's go, Yoshino.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.301
Things won't end so easily
if you use this room again.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.261
Got it.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.722
Hey, what are you doing?

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:42.227
What?

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:44.729
I'm taking it back.

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.856
What?

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.617
Move your foot.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.164
Hey, stop that!

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.167
I'm taking this back.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:07.877
Can you move your foot?

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.932
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.608
Close the door.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.318
Got it.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.291
AUDIO-VISUAL CLUB

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:50.336
-Come on, stand up!
-Take this!

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:35.316
"The antonym of like is indifference."

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.569
Did the person
who came up with this go to hell?

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.740
Getting along with others
with bad intentions

00:04:43.408 --> 00:04:45.827
is better than leaving them alone?

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.036
That's impossible.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.623
"The antonym of like is hate."

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.418
That's what Japanese people like.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:57.880
They complicate things
and gain joy from them.

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.217
But Japanese people
didn't come up with that.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.263
I'm talking about
the fallacious statement.

00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:06.431
What?

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.685
Some foreigner initially said that…

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.439
"The antonym of love
is indifference," right?

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.568
There are many definitions of love.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.238
That's why we can define
the antonym as "indifference."

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.656
I guess so.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.952
But the Japanese
don't usually use the word "love."

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.330
So in this country,

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.541
it changed to "like" at some point.

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:38.046
Can the antonyms of "love"
and "indifference" be established?

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.340 line:20%
No one really thought about it
before spreading it.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.178
Everyone likes to play word games.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:50.475
Because humans can't live
without making excuses.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.148
What's this?

00:05:59.484 --> 00:06:03.029
An experiment to test
how big can humans become.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.078
And what you're holding is a test
to see how small it can go.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.872
This is…

00:06:14.373 --> 00:06:15.708
a human?

00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.838
Junpei, are you used to seeing corpses?

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.507
I don't know.

00:06:23.508 --> 00:06:25.426
If this were my mother,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.639
I might collapse and hate you.

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:34.435
But I know humanity is ugly.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.398
So I don't have any expectations
for other people.

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:43.903
I don't have any thoughts
about someone else's death either.

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:49.784
Indifference is the virtue
that mankind deserves.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.289
And someone like you seeks revenge?

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:59.627
Are you saying that
I'm contradicting myself?

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:04.507
Do you think people have a heart?

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:06.134
What?

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.677
Is the answer "no"?

00:07:08.302 --> 00:07:09.971
That's right. It's "no."

00:07:11.097 --> 00:07:12.723
<i>Humans have souls.</i>

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.725
<i>But that's not the heart.</i>

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:16.978
Then my…

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:22.066
I'm the only one in the world
who understands the structure of a soul.

00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:27.822
<i>Because I change the shape
of a creature by touching the soul.</i>

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:32.702
<i>Emotions are products
of the soul's metabolism.</i>

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.289
<i>It's too mechanical to call it a heart.</i>

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:41.002
<i>People think too much
about the things they can't see.</i>

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.504
<i>As someone who can see them,</i>

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:47.383
<i>souls are the same as bodies,
it's nothing special.</i>

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:51.762
It just exists there.

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:56.184
Do you understand?
Life has no value or weight.

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:59.312
It's like the flow of water
between heaven and earth.

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:01.981
Life is just a cycle.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:07.987
You and I are the same,
meaningless and worthless.

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.991
Father…

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:14.619
Because of this,
you can do whatever you want.

00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:16.662
It's your freedom on how to survive.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.374
Don't be imprisoned by
the ideal of indifference.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.628
There's no need to implement
a single living method.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:28.090
Eat when you're hungry,
kill when you hate.

00:08:29.634 --> 00:08:32.803
I acknowledge
your entire existence, Junpei.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.701
I found him.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.204
Wait, casual clothes?

00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:01.624
He hasn't been to school lately.

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:05.920 line:20%
But I'm the same, too.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.464 line:20%
Are the others doing well?

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.888
They seem to be doing well.

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:19.267 line:20%
So what are we going to do?

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:21.352
Use that.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:22.270
What?

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.479
Is that a Cursed Spirit?

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.651
It's a Fly Head,
a low-level Cursed Spirit below Grade 4.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:34.115
Once you see no one around,
use the Fly Head to attack him.

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:35.032
What?

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:38.995
<i>One, if he's a normal person
who can't see the curse…</i>

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.291
<i>Please save him.</i>

00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:47.712
<i>Two, if he can see the curse,
but he doesn't know how to handle it…</i>

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.382
<i>Please save him too.</i>

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:54.051
<i>Then question him about the incident.</i>

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.471
<i>Three, if he eliminates the Fly Head
with cursed technique…</i>

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.808
Arrest him on the spot.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.476
With force?

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.936
Yes.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.773
Doesn't matter if it's a misunderstanding.
We'll apologize later.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.567
However…

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.947 line:20%
Four, if he has the potential of
a Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerer and above…

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:18.409 line:20%
We'll retreat temporarily
and meet with Mr. Nanami.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:22.622
If he's a Grade 2,
I should be able to handle him.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.206
If he's a Cursed Spirit, that is.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.124
What?

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.836
Fushiguro should have said this before.

00:10:29.337 --> 00:10:31.297
We usually dispatch a Jujutsu Sorcerer

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.091
of the same grade
as the Cursed Spirit to perform the task.

00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:39.430
<i>This means a Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerer
can beat Grade 2 Cursed Spirits easily.</i>

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:43.517
<i>A Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerer is almost
on par with Grade 1 Cursed Spirits.</i>

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.065
Why don't I know
such important information?

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:51.108
<i>Because Mr. Gojo's your teacher!</i>

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.530
We'll need to get out of the car here.

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:03.954
I feel like I'm in a charade.
This is lame.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.008
If you're going to come out, do it now.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.763
They may look distorted,
and it's too late to save them,

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.599
but it's unpleasant to kill humans.

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:29.480
Wow, I'm glad.

00:11:30.272 --> 00:11:33.025
I would be troubled
if Satoru Gojo was here.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.196
But if someone too weak comes,
I can't have my experiment.

00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:44.078
I don't like working overtime.
Let's make it quick.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.377
I'll kill you!

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.171
<i>They feel similar.</i>

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.424
<i>That perfectly flippant attitude</i>

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.843
<i>and the sinister strength behind it.</i>

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:19.238
What?

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.241
What?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:25.619
I should've blocked it with cursed energy.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.997
Is it that kind of cursed technique?

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.207
What do you mean by "that kind"?

00:12:30.291 --> 00:12:34.253
I hate open-ended questions that are
directly thrown at the other party.

00:12:34.336 --> 00:12:35.921
That's great.

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.757
You don't dislike talking.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.634
It depends on the opponent.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.013
<i>A Cursed Spirit
that can communicate this well…</i>

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.016
<i>Mr. Gojo's report only mentioned</i>

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:49.393
<i>two unregistered
Special Grade Curse Spirits.</i>

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.521
<i>It's hard to believe that
there's no connection between the two.</i>

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:59.862
Hey, which one do you think came first?
The soul or the body?

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:00.779
What?

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:07.786
Isn't there a similar question?
Did the chicken or the egg come first?

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:12.041
<i>Is the soul hosted in the body?</i>

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:16.337
<i>Or is the soul enveloping the body?</i>

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.382
<i>I guess I have to hear him out.</i>

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:22.801
The former.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.804
Wrong, the latter is the answer.

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:30.893
The soul always comes before the body.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.606
The shape of the body is affected
by the shape of the soul.

00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:38.317
I'm not healing myself.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.779
I'm just preserving
the shape of my soul consciously.

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.242
You should understand, right?

00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:50.996
My cursed technique is to touch
the soul and change its shape.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.416 line:20%
Idle Transfiguration.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.631
I store human beings.

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:02.758
It's quite hard to do that.

00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:08.013
Usually, a person will die
soon after their shape is changed.

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.766
But what about a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.062
It's 5:30 p.m. now.

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.107
I started working at 10:00 a.m. today.

00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:22.611 line:20%
No matter what,
I must get off work by 6:00 p.m.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.203
Yoshino.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.080
Where have you been?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.793
It's not good to skip school.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.838
Mr. Sotomura.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:43.257
Have you heard?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.844
Sayama, Nishimura, and Honda are dead.

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:49.680
You're close with them, aren't you?

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:50.931
What?

00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.102
<i>You have no friends.</i>

00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:57.187
<i>They often look after you, don't they?</i>

00:14:57.271 --> 00:15:00.441
But you didn't attend their funeral.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.110
-You shouldn't be like this.
<i>-Close?</i>

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.570
<i>-Me…</i>
-I'll go with you.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.447
<i>-…and them?</i>
-At least pay your respects.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.657
<i>-He's crazy.</i>
-Okay?

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:14.496
<i>Teachers work in school
after graduating from one.</i>

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:20.628 line:20%
<i>You've never experienced
society before, have you?</i>

00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:25.758 line:20%
<i>That's why there are
giant babies like you!</i>

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:28.802
Come, open your mouth.

00:15:29.386 --> 00:15:33.265
<i>-Every single one of you…</i>
-Look here.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.812
<i>I acknowledge
your entire existence, Junpei.</i>

00:15:41.649 --> 00:15:44.485
What are you muttering?

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:47.655
Did you lose your mind
from staying home? Just joking.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.206
What?

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.918
<i>This guy…</i>

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.128
<i>He can see it.</i>

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.845 line:20%
It hurts. That guy…

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.347
Take a peek.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.516
We're starting, Itadori.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.351
Wait! Someone's coming!

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:18.268
What?

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.395
Oh, no!

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:22.481 line:20%
I'm so glad.

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:25.484
What's this? Are you a gymnast?

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:30.239
Hey. I have something to ask you,
so come with me.

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:32.491
Well…

00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:33.826
Listen to me.

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:35.244
<i>-This button…</i>
-Wait!

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:38.747
I'm talking with him. You're so rude.

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:42.626
Well, this is quite important.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.003
Something important?

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:45.754
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:48.257
-Which school are you--
-I pull!

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.844
-What…
-What?

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:56.306
What are you doing? You brat! Stop it!

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.268
Don't take my pants!

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:01.979
Stop…

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.440
Stop right there!

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:09.653
What happened?

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:11.447
What?

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:13.490
Well then, let's go.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.035
That was quick! Have you finished a lap?

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:16.952
Yes.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.913
You didn't have to do that.

00:17:19.997 --> 00:17:22.541
You could have just dragged me away.

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.251
Well…

00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:27.087
-But you hate him, right?
-What?

00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:29.840
-Why?
-What?

00:17:29.923 --> 00:17:31.467
Just a feeling.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.260
Was I wrong?

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:34.845
It's true.

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:39.058
You wouldn't want people you hate
to stand in front of your house, right?

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.685
Anyway, let's go over there.

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:47.107
Okay.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.163
You're nimble.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.011
<i>This is fun.</i>

00:18:16.804 --> 00:18:21.475 line:20%
<i>He changes the form of humans,
but the mass remains the same?</i>

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:27.689
<i>In any case,
it's not compatible with my technique.</i>

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.983
-Help…
-What?

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:32.986 line:20%
Help me.

00:18:35.989 --> 00:18:39.326
A transfigured human can't be saved.

00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:41.829
If you're being attacked,
don't hesitate to kill them.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.039
This is for the sake of the victims too.

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:48.752
Oh, sorry.

00:18:49.503 --> 00:18:51.839
I practiced it many times.

00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.883
Disfiguration will not
kill them instantly,

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:59.638
but the accuracy of the brain
or consciousness isn't good enough.

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:03.100
Sometimes, sweat from the soul
will ooze out like this.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.102
Don't mind it. Let's continue.

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:08.397
I don't mind at all.

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.653
I always keep my work
and emotions separate.

00:19:16.405 --> 00:19:20.409 line:20%
You're bad at lying!
Your soul is wavering.

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:23.787
Let's see. What grade are you?

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.122
Grade 1.

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.707
No wonder you're strong.

00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:29.960
Your body is perfect for experimentation.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:32.504
I'm so lucky.

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.215
Thank you.

00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:44.224
Did the sudden speed increase scare you?

00:19:44.725 --> 00:19:47.853
I can reshape my own soul, too.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:52.107
A Jujutsu Sorcerer may have used
cursed energy to protect their body,

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:54.943
but they have never tried
to protect their soul with it.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.197
Because to do so, you need
to be conscious of your soul first.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.407
Otherwise, you can't protect it.

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:05.162
But it seems like you're subconsciously
guarding your soul with cursed energy.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:08.916
Otherwise, you'll be my pawn now.

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:12.628
But if I strike your soul
a few more times,

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.546
you won't be a human anymore!

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.973
I won't let you escape!

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.407
Is that all, Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:44.159
You tried so hard to escape.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.286
But you should be
reaching your limits, right?

00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:54.878
Unfortunately…

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:58.173
<i>What's this?</i>

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:01.510
<i>His cursed energy is rising.</i>

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:05.555
I'll start working overtime.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:38.482
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:39.066 --> 00:22:40.484
Fushiguro!

00:22:40.567 --> 00:22:42.652
Did you see my uniform jacket?

00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:44.071
No, I didn't see it.

00:22:44.154 --> 00:22:47.741
That's strange. I thought I left it here.

00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:48.784
Hey.

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:51.745
Panda, did you see my uniform jacket?

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.580
What?

00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:56.249
I didn't see it.

00:22:56.833 --> 00:23:00.754
Is that so? I wonder where it went!

00:23:04.966 --> 00:23:07.427
Hey, my skirt's missing too.

00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:10.263
This is the bottom line
that can't be crossed!

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.600
Mustard!

00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:15.268
Bonito flakes…

00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:19.773
This bunch of trash!

00:23:20.649 --> 00:23:22.400
What a scene to behold.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:24.653 line:20%
What?

00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.280
This is Maki's.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:30.408
Good evening!

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:33.078
I'm Nobara Kugisaki!
