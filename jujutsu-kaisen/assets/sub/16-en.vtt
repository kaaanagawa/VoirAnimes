00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.384
<i>It is impossible for the hand
to move faster than the eye.</i>

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.637
<i>If someone doesn't have
an eye that can judge quality,</i>

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.266
<i>they can never create anything
of value with their hands.</i>

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.352
This is a popular saying
within the artistic community.

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.522
This can be applied in any industry.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.899
The growth rate of those
who possess this eye

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:28.194
far eclipses the rate of those who do not!

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.503
<i>He saw my right hook</i>

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:49.007
<i>and used his left hand
to strike back immediately!</i>

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.885 line:20%
<i>It's an action
that he's unable to do before.</i>

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.428
<i>He's growing…</i>

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.264
<i>by devouring me!</i>

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.602
<i>What a beautiful fall!</i>

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.688
<i>His face is defenseless.</i>

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.274 line:20%
<i>I can do it with Divergent Fist!</i>

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:07.942 line:20%
<i>However…</i>

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.158 line:20%
<i>He caught my fist from gaining momentum
by blocking it with his head!</i>

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.996
I want you to devour something else.

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.709
Your Divergent Fist is created using
superhuman speed with your cursed energy,

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:30.256
which has a time lag that
Jujutsu Sorcerers usually don't possess.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.050
That's tricky.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:36.262
An average Jujutsu Sorcerer
would be confused about what happened.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.850
It's also very effective
against opponents, if they are inferior.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.854 line:20%
But it will be useless
against a Special Grade.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.273 line:20%
What will you do, my friend?

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.904 line:20%
I will inject a whole lot of
my cursed energy with all my power.

00:01:52.987 --> 00:01:54.030
Good!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:57.450
So why did your cursed energy get delayed?

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:00.787
That's because
your cursed energy is flowing!

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:03.706
What?

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.291
Wait.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.086
Do you mean I should let it flow faster?

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.921
Letting your cursed energy flow

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.550
is something
many Jujutsu Sorcerers do consciously.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:17.762
Thoughts like "I'm mad"
or "I'm boiling with anger."

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.140
<i>In theory, cursed energy
from negative emotions</i>

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:23.643
<i>starts to flow from the belly button
to the whole body.</i>

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:24.561
CURSED ENERGY

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.813
From the belly button into the chest,

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:31.067
cursed energy flows through
the shoulders, arms, and fist.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:36.573
The consciousness of distinguishing
body parts delays the cursed energy.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.577
The idea of letting
cursed energy flow is not wrong.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.995
But it's just the first step.

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.914
You can't get stuck within this thought.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.624
The better a Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.085
the harder it is to predict
their cursed energy flow.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.255
For a different reason than you.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.258
Do we think with our stomachs?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.261
Do we get angry with our heads?

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.847 line:20%
Listen here, Itadori.

00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:17.155
We exist in this world
with our entire body and soul.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.242
Most people have taken
that maxim for granted.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:28.917
Thanks, Todo.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.421
I think I understand it now.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:35.757
I guess…

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.383
there's no more need for words.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.928
I won't show mercy!

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:48.478
<i>I'll try my best to guide you!</i>

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.730
<i>Don't die, Itadori.</i>

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.315
<i>Climb up.</i>

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:53.900
<i>Climb to new heights!</i>

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:29.537 line:20%
Hey, you.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.624 line:20%
The old man in Kyoto School
asked you to kill Itadori, right?

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:36.294 line:20%
<i>This girl has good instincts.</i>

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:40.048 line:20%
<i>No, it must be Panda.</i>

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.216
What are you talking about?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.469
You don't need to hide it.

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.679
I'll fight you like I mean to kill you.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:51.142
Especially Mai, that Maki knockoff.

00:05:51.225 --> 00:05:52.393
What?

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.562
What's that?

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:58.024
Even Pepper's response
is more decent than yours.

00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.151
<i>What's this? She's not mad?</i>

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.154
<i>I feel the same!</i>

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:07.533
Speaking of which, your team has a Pepper.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:11.037
Shall I turn him
into a pile of scrap and dump it?

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.791
<i>She's scary.</i>

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:20.838
Panda!

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:26.219
He's a Cursed Corpse. He won't die.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.387
He's just temporarily immobilized.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.850
So who are you calling Pepper?

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.561
Wait, Mechamaru.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:41.234
I will give this first-year student
a cute lesson

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:43.236
on Mai's hardships

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.822
and what it means to live
as a female Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.740
I'll teach her well.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.492 line:20%
Just joking.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:50.785
What?

00:06:55.164 --> 00:06:56.541
Do you like attention?

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:59.335 line:20%
You should have just hid at the back
and supported her.

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:01.629
Well, let's get along…

00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:03.506
since we're both the same.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.259
You're just a mere puppet.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.933 line:20%
What do you know?

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.728
Gosh.

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:20.231
I thought we were supposed to hunt curses.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.859
Sword Option.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:27.488
Boost On.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:36.956
Ultra Spin!

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:48.885
Cheeky runner.

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.137
<i>I really need to finish him off quickly</i>

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.723
<i>or run away to go help Nobara,</i>

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.058
<i>but he has ranged weapons.</i>

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.854
<i>We have no information about
Mechamaru, Nishimiya, and Miwa.</i>

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:01.856
You're quite strong.

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.357
What's your grade?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:06.194
GRADE 1, SEMI-GRADE 1
GRADE 2, SEMI-GRADE 2

00:08:06.277 --> 00:08:08.404
<i>This is my guess.</i>

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:10.865
<i>So this might be a little hard for Nobara.</i>

00:08:10.948 --> 00:08:14.535
I don't think it's necessary to know
my grade in this situation,

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:16.329
but I'll tell you.

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:19.665
I'm a Semi-Grade 1.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.919 line:20%
<i>-What?</i>
-Ultra Cannon!

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.088
<i>His range of attack is wide.</i>

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:38.559
<i>It's cooling down. It's a big move
that needs time to charge and recover!</i>

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:43.189 line:20%
<i>Given my firepower,
I have to pinpoint its core.</i>

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:45.316 line:20%
<i>Cursed Corpse.</i>

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.361
<i>It refers to a generic name
for a nonliving thing</i>

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:51.656
<i>that hosts a curse
and can act autonomously.</i>

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:57.370
<i>An artificial Cursed Corpse
has a core in place of a heart.</i>

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:07.421
<i>Created by Masamichi Yaga,
the leading sorcerer in Puppetry Jujutsu,</i>

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.383
<i>Panda is my greatest masterpiece.</i>

00:09:10.466 --> 00:09:13.094
<i>It's a Cursed Corpse born with emotions.</i>

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:25.147
<i>An Abrupt-Mutated Cursed Corpse.</i>

00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:29.235
<i>Panda is not a panda!</i>

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:41.038 line:20%
<i>It's hard to tell
what its next move will be.</i>

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:02.435
Well, I should know if there are
similar Cursed Corpses like me.

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:06.272
I've never heard of any,
so you're not a Cursed Corpse.

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:10.192
You're being controlled remotely
by a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:13.821
Even so, don't get angry because
you're treated as a Cursed Corpse.

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:15.656
You don't like being compared to me?

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:18.075
I'll get hurt.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.162
I will really get hurt!

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.373
Based on your cursed energy output,

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.084
the main body shouldn't be far.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.378
No, it must be right outside the arena.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.173
So it's pointless for me to find it.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:34.091
No one will be watching you then.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:36.385
Maybe I should destroy you now.

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.888
Neither will come true.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:42.767
Do you know about
the Heavenly Restriction?

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.937
It's different from
the Binding Vow set by oneself.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:50.816
It's one that's been forced
onto the body since birth.

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:55.112
I was born without
a right arm and both legs,

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:57.782
and I have no sensation below my waist.

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:00.993 line:20%
My skin is so fragile
that it can't handle moonlight.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:05.122 line:20%
My pores feel like
they were pricked by needles.

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:08.876 line:20%
In return, I was granted
a wide range of cursed techniques…

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:12.296 line:20%
and cursed energy
that far surpasses others.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.132
This is not the strength I seek.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:18.511
If my body could be restored
by giving up my cursed techniques,

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:20.054
I would gladly do it.

00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:21.764
You see…

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:27.186
I see you walking around casually
under the sun as a Cursed Corpse…

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:30.731
I just can't stand it!

00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:34.985
Ultimate Mechamaru!

00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:38.656
Mode, Albatross!

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:41.951
<i>What an incredible amount
of cursed energy!</i>

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.577
<i>Based on his position…</i>

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:46.872
<i>Nobara will get caught in it!</i>

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:49.458
I have to take it!

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.002
Ultimate Cannon!

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.143
Is it dead?

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:10.771
No, you're not worthy of…

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:13.858
the concept of death.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:17.862
While bragging about your misfortune,

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:21.365
you've also disclosed
your cursed technique.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:24.118
Quite the shrewd Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:28.122
<i>He's still alive after Ultimate Cannon?</i>

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:34.920
I'm a little irritated now.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.256
What's happening?

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.884
That look of yours…

00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:41.677
Panda…

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.679
is not a panda!

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:50.853
Panda.

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:55.316
Actually, you have
an older brother and sister.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.152
I don't.

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.487
No, you do.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.447
They are in your body.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.948
What's with the honorific?

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:04.533
In my body?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:05.451
Yes.

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.411
One day, you'll understand.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:10.164
No matter when…

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:15.085
<i>They would always be there
to lend you their power.</i>

00:13:17.254 --> 00:13:18.547
Sword Option.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.466
Ultra Shield!

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:31.393
<i>Usually, there is only one core
for a Cursed Corpse.</i>

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:34.146
<i>But there are three cores in my body.</i>

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.691
<i>I can transform my body
by replacing the main core.</i>

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:41.904
<i>My panda core emphasizes balance.</i>

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:46.075
<i>My brother, gorilla core emphasizes
strength and is good at quick combat.</i>

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:48.702
<i>And my shy sister.</i>

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.830
<i>My sister's core was hit
by the first shot,</i>

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:55.251
<i>and my panda core is exhausted
from the attack just now.</i>

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:58.671
<i>I have no choice
but to use Gorilla Mode to win.</i>

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:09.974
<i>He's not as powerful as Todo.</i>

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:11.559
<i>But that palm strike just now…</i>

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.019
<i>It reverberated my insides.</i>

00:14:15.312 --> 00:14:17.690
<i>Despite defending, I'm still injured.</i>

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:19.483
Did you notice?

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.194
This is Gorilla Mode's ultimate move,

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:27.032
<i>the Unblockable Drumming Beat!</i>

00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:31.036
<i>If the Unblockable Drumming Beat
strikes my head or chest again,</i>

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.789
<i>Mechamaru won't be able to move anymore.</i>

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:37.960
<i>My right arm and Sword Option
can't be used anymore.</i>

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.546
<i>I can't use Ultimate Cannon either.</i>

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:45.134
<i>Gorilla Mode consumes cursed energy
quickly since it's a gorilla.</i>

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:46.802
<i>I must hurry up.</i>

00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:48.762
<i>I've destroyed his right arm.</i>

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.265
<i>He can't use maximum power anymore.</i>

00:14:51.348 --> 00:14:54.059
<i>No sword in his left arm or mouth.
Is only his cannon left?</i>

00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:57.062
<i>Even so, he won't simply use it.</i>

00:14:57.146 --> 00:15:01.567
<i>He thought the two cannon attacks
should have finished me off.</i>

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:06.238
<i>In fact, two of my cores are crippled.</i>

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.491
<i>I guess he'll aim at my core
at a point-blank range</i>

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.619
<i>and finish me off.</i>

00:15:11.702 --> 00:15:12.703
<i>However…</i>

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.379
<i>I have the advantage in close combat.</i>

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.336
<i>A tile?</i>

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.422
<i>Did he just grab that off the roof?</i>

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.681 line:20%
<i>He uses his boosters after distracting me?</i>

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.307
<i>This guy is very skillful!</i>

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.144
<i>I won't miss this time.</i>

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.856
<i>Its core is right here,
where the cursed energy…</i>

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.983
<i>is the strongest!</i>

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:15.284
You did very well.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.119
For a puppet, that is.

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:20.789
What?

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:23.709
Don't compare me to other Cursed Corpses.

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:27.046
I can fake my core's location
by concentrating my cursed energy.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.340
After all, I was faking
my core's quantity all along.

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.605
You lost because…

00:17:44.688 --> 00:17:46.732
you've underestimated a puppet!

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:51.737
I also never considered myself
to be the same as the humans around me.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.783
So I guess I can understand you
in that sense.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.496
But I've never envied human beings.

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.747
What?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.333 line:20%
Because humans are gross!

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:10.798
<i>They risk their lives
to achieve their goals.</i>

00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.634
<i>Sometimes they act all decisive
and then indecisive later.</i>

00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:14.927
<i>I don't get them.</i>

00:18:15.552 --> 00:18:19.348
But I like them
because they possess qualities I don't.

00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:20.724
Although it's gross.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.436
It's not easy for you either, right?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.190
<i>But that doesn't mean
the one who has it hard is always right.</i>

00:18:28.273 --> 00:18:31.443
<i>In fact, I'm not your enemy.</i>

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:33.904
Why are you a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.115
Is there nothing else to do?

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:38.700 line:20%
I don't really care,

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:44.498 line:20%
but if you have any wish,
I'll help you fulfill it.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:49.211
<i>Mechamaru.</i>

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.089
Don't waste your big moves.

00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:55.217
There may be more than
one enemy in front of you.

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.970
Mechamaru.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.764
If you can't instantly answer
the type of woman you like,

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.725
don't think about being
a full-fledged Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.227
Mechamaru.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.188 line:20%
This is a present
in place of obligatory chocolates.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:11.108
I heard that you like Evolta AA batteries.

00:19:11.191 --> 00:19:12.609
I don't eat that.

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:13.735
What?

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.195
But Mai said…

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.241
Someday…

00:19:35.716 --> 00:19:39.094
<i>I want to be with everyone.</i>

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:41.638
What?

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:42.848
Pardon?

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:47.728
Will you still help me
after seeing my true form?

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:48.854
What?

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.567
I have no right to be picky
about appearances.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.027
I'm a panda.

00:19:57.571 --> 00:19:58.447
See you.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:01.241
Let me visit you next time.

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.664
Shut up, you darn puppet.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:14.922
I almost forgot!

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.006
What?

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:19.885 line:20%
Lend me your phone.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:23.430 line:20%
KYOTO SISTER-SCHOOL GOODWILL EVENT
TEAM BATTLE, MECHAMARU WITHDRAWS

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.438
<i>Are you serious?</i>

00:20:31.521 --> 00:20:33.315
<i>This person…</i>

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.317
<i>She's crazy strong!</i>

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.452
<i>Juju Stroll.</i>

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:15.834 line:20%
Mechamaru, tell Noritoshi
that Ms. Utahime is looking for him.

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:21.214
Mechamaru, help me give this to Todo.

00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:24.259
Mechamaru, I'm glad you're here!

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:27.387
Help me give this to Todo and Kamo.

00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:33.935
Why do you guys always ask me for help?

00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:39.024
Don't talk to me right now.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:42.819
Takada is streaming live now.

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:47.949
"Ibaragi"? It's Ibaraki.

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.993
You don't even know this?

00:22:51.286 --> 00:22:54.456
<i>Obviously, it's because
we don't want trouble.</i>

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.963
<i>I'm still afraid of them.</i>

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:08.512
<i>If we say that,
he might not help us anymore.</i>

00:23:10.263 --> 00:23:11.556
Mechamaru.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.641
What?

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:15.727
We're counting on you!

00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:16.645
Good.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.233
All right, it's time for our assignments!

00:23:21.316 --> 00:23:23.860
No, tell me the reason…

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.866
Never mind.

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:32.077
Since they are counting on me,

00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:33.995
it's not too bad after all.
