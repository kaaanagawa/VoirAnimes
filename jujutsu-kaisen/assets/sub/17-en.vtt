00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.884 line:20%
Maki?

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.512 line:20%
She's just a small fry.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.222 line:20%
She can't even see curses.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:39.849 line:20%
Just an ordinary person
who uses Cursed Tools.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.310
She will forever be a Grade 4.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.647
I don't know why she bothers to be
a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:47.816
Break time is over.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.150
Okay.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.652
<i>I see.</i>

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.196
<i>I feel a little relieved.</i>

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.198
<i>Mai, you fool!</i>

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.659
<i>This person…</i>

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.743
<i>is crazy strong!</i>

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.703
<i>She uses a long weapon.</i>

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.247
<i>I want to get closer,</i>

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.415
<i>but my hands are full
just dodging her attacks!</i>

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.292
<i>If the blade was exposed,</i>

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.420
<i>I would have died twice already.</i>

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:11.339
<i>And she's a Grade 4 Jujutsu Sorcerer?</i>

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.677
<i>She could probably even defeat
a Grade 2 Curse with ease!</i>

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.390
<i>Speaking of which,
how is she swinging her spear</i>

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.183
<i>in such a cramped fighting space?</i>

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.330
New Shadow Style…

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.292
Simple Domain!

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:54.299
<i>An automatic technique that counters
all intruders within a 2.21m radius.</i>

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.678
<i>It will be dispelled when both feet leave
the set point of domain expansion.</i>

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:02.765
<i>Also, the Batto Sword Drawing
deals with oncoming enemies.</i>

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.601
<i>It covers the blade with cursed energy</i>

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:06.352
<i>and speeds up while in its hilt.</i>

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.813
<i>It's New Shadow Style's fastest technique.</i>

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:11.524
<i>Don't think about defeating her with this.</i>

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:13.902
<i>Try to create an opening first!</i>

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:15.445
<i>An Iai sword drawing technique?</i>

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.614
<i>She must be hiding something.</i>

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:19.782
<i>Judging from the gap,</i>

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.077
<i>she probably wants to disarm
my Cursed Tool to create a flaw.</i>

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.706
In that case…

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:28.249 line:20%
<i>She broke it!</i>

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.376 line:20%
<i>Is she giving up her advantage in reach?</i>

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.504
<i>She threw it!</i>

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.218
<i>A hidden weapon? What sharp intuition.
She's using bait to close the gap!</i>

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.349
<i>My feet have left the set point!</i>

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:45.308
<i>But it's fine.</i>

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.977
<i>I'll step back and lure her close…</i>

00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.441
<i>Aikido? She's knowledgeable!</i>

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.777
What?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.863
Your katana sword isn't too bad.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:01.199
Sword-stealing technique…

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:03.034
Give it back to me.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:10.458
That kid is really interesting.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.503
Why don't you make her a Grade 2?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.214
I think so too.

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:18.758
But the Zenin Family
keeps getting in my way.

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.136
They should just be honest
and acknowledge her skills.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:26.641
I don't understand relationships
not established on monetary terms.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.143
You haven't changed a bit.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:33.481
Anyway, the video feed on Yuji
keeps getting disrupted.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.775 line:20%
Animals are fickle.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:38.236 line:20%
And it's tiring to share vision.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.655
Oh, is that so?

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.116
Honestly, Mei, which side are you on?

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.367
Which side?

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.327 line:20%
I side with money, of course.

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.205 line:20%
Things that can't be measured
with money have no value.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.458
Because it won't turn into money.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:54.961
How much did he pay you?

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.965
<i>I don't know what you're up to,</i>

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:03.219
<i>but Yuji won't be manipulated
so easily now.</i>

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:05.388
Hey!

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.515
Something's happening.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.603
A talisman is put
on all Cursed Spirits in the area.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.981
When a Cursed Spirit disappears…

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:20.236
the matching talisman
in the auditorium will also disappear.

00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:23.698
Different elimination reactions
are produced

00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:26.075
based on the previously
recorded cursed energy.

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.662
<i>Elimination by Tokyo School
will ignite a red flame,</i>

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.374
<i>while elimination by Kyoto School
will ignite a blue flame.</i>

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.376
As Maki is there too,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.712
an elimination
with unrecorded cursed energy

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:39.338
will ignite a red flame as well.

00:05:39.964 --> 00:05:41.758
A tie?

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.427
Everyone's just not interested
in the game.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.346
Why can't everyone get along?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.931
Because they are like Utahime.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:50.933
You're the only one
I can't get along with!

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:54.062
<i>By the way, it was Panda
who eliminated the Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.524
Come down, you darn witch!

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:01.360
I've done it a few times.

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:04.363
Hurry up and catch me…

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:05.865
First-year!

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:10.536
<i>Her wind of cursed energy
is strong enough to push me back.</i>

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.955
<i>It's mixed with gravel
and branches. It hurts!</i>

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.374
<i>If I'm careless, I'll get scratches.</i>

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.627
What?

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.968 line:20%
How dare you hurt my face.

00:06:26.552 --> 00:06:29.222
To men, a scar on the face
is like a medal.

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:33.101
But to women, it's a flaw.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.352
What?

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:37.855
Do you think Jujutsu Sorcerers
are judged based on strength?

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.690
Isn't that the case?

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.943
That only applies to men.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:42.985
What?

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:44.612
As a woman,

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.949
even if you're strong,
you're looked down on if you're not cute.

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:52.578
Of course, you're looked down on too
if you're cute but weak.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:54.330
Do you understand?

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:58.835
Female Jujutsu Sorcerers
not only have to be skilled.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:00.586
We have to be perfect.

00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.588
On top of that,

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.217
Mai has faced discrimination
far beyond your understanding.

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:10.096
I understand…

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:11.848
that you're annoying!

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.147
<i>This girl…</i>

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.732 line:20%
<i>She's a first-year,
but she's used to fighting.</i>

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:25.736
<i>She's still standing despite
being knocked down several times.</i>

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:28.239
I'm used to…

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:31.117
being beaten up.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:35.121
<i>If I increase my power, I could kill her.</i>

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.999
<i>No, it's just an excuse.</i>

00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:40.293
<i>The real reason
I can't attack with full power…</i>

00:07:40.793 --> 00:07:42.253
<i>is because of Inumaki.</i>

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:45.006
Cursed Speech is a cursed technique

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.175
that reinforces words with cursed energy.

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:51.053
We just have to protect our brains
and ears with cursed energy.

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:54.974
Cursed Speech is a technique
that deals with Cursed Spirits.

00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:56.601
Like I said just now,

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.978
since we know
that the opponent will attack,

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.688
it's not that scary anymore.

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:04.233
<i>On the other hand, if we don't know
when the opponent will attack,</i>

00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.277
<i>then we'll keep getting distracted.</i>

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:10.615
<i>Furthermore, I'm not used to using
cursed energy to protect my head.</i>

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:13.910
<i>It's tricky whether he's here or not.</i>

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:16.496
Is your lecture…

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:17.497
over yet?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.790
What people expected from Mai

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.960
wasn't simply just perfection.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.588
An elite Jujutsu Sorcerer family

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.632
and one of the Three Great Families,

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:28.883
the Zenin Family.

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.636
Perfection is expected in the family.

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:35.306
<i>They inherit the cursed technique
passed down by the Zenin Family.</i>

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:36.265
<i>Otherwise,</i>

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.602
<i>you'll be an outcast
that will fall behind the rest.</i>

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:45.566 line:20%
<i>Among those, women aren't even allowed
to stand on the starting line.</i>

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.903
<i>"If you're not part of the Zenin Family,
you're not a Jujutsu Sorcerer."</i>

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:52.073
<i>"And if you're not a Jujutsu Sorcerer,
you're not a human."</i>

00:08:52.156 --> 00:08:57.453
<i>They have to serve that nasty family
despite being despised their entire lives.</i>

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.084
In order to achieve the life
we took for granted,

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:06.420
did you know the hardships
Mai and the others went through?

00:09:08.172 --> 00:09:11.759
Why don't you use that brain,
who thinks of a curse as an ally,

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:14.428
to think about it?

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:18.558
You're so noisy.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.644
You think every misfortunate people
deserve forgiveness?

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:23.813
Then what?

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:27.400
Just because someone is fortunate,
they deserve to be ridiculed?

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.027
<i>That's the reason why Saori…</i>

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.573
Regardless of her upbringing,

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.575
I just don't like her.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.119
<i>Despite their similar upbringing,</i>

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:40.288
<i>I love Maki.</i>

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:42.248
<i>Let me ask you.</i>

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:45.501
<i>Have you guys ever thought about</i>

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.504
that fool of a human
you were going to curse?

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.466
Why am I obliged to respond
to "perfection" or "unreasonable"?

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:57.013 line:20%
Is your life just a job?

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.764
<i>Straw Doll Technique…</i>

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.182
Hairpin!

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:09.358
<i>So this is why
she kept throwing and missing nails!</i>

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.462
Even if I lower my height,
you still can't reach me, right?

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.300
No, I reached you!

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:36.677
This is enough!

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:40.348
<i>Did she just grab one of the bristles
from my broom?</i>

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.393 line:20%
Who cares about the difference
between boys and girls?

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.313 line:20%
Just do whatever you want!

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:50.775
I like myself the most
when I dress up beautifully.

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:53.861
And I like myself
when I try to become strong!

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.780
I am…

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.617
Nobara Kugisaki!

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.288
<i>I can't control my broom.</i>

00:11:04.372 --> 00:11:08.000
<i>If I hit her with my hammer,
I might end up killing her.</i>

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.086
<i>If so…</i>

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:11.629
<i>What?</i>

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:13.589
<i>A toy hammer?</i>

00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.891
One more hit!

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:34.527
It's barely within the effective range.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.862
Great.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.531 line:20%
She got hit.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.909
Hello, Momo.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.870
She's fine. It's just a rubber bullet.

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.164
Anyway, that light just now…

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:48.999
That was Ultimate Cannon, right?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.211
But I can't reach Mechamaru.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:56.841
<i>If he's forced to use it,
then he might be out of the competition.</i>

00:11:56.924 --> 00:11:59.135
<i>I guess Panda will be back soon.</i>

00:11:59.218 --> 00:12:02.513
<i>Get out of there
and support everyone from the skies.</i>

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:04.432
<i>Without you, we're doomed.</i>

00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:06.100
Okay.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.478
Mai, I…

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.439
It's okay, Momo.

00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:12.857
I understand.

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:14.525
<i>Okay.</i>

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:16.652
What's this?

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:18.487
Aren't you going to call for backup?

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:22.741
I'm okay with fighting two opponents.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.620
Everyone has a different
kind of enjoyment, right?

00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:29.457
Compared to everyone
working together to defeat you,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.834
I prefer to enjoy the fun of…

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.711
defeating you myself.

00:12:33.794 --> 00:12:36.297
Call me "Big Sister,"

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.882
my younger sister.

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.552
What do you think of Maki?

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:44.763
It feels like my answer
is going to be wrong no matter what.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:48.184
She's a very outstanding woman.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.020
What? I meant her as a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.814
Oh, you mean that? I'm relieved.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:56.817
To be honest,

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:59.528
I don't know much about Jujutsu,

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.364
but she can fight very well.

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:03.908
Maybe because of her poise?

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.701
The way she walks is excellent.

00:13:05.784 --> 00:13:08.037 line:20%
Maki is only a Grade 4.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.997 line:20%
What? Are you serious?

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.334
She's from a troublesome
Jujutsu Sorcerer family.

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:17.421 line:20%
She sort of expelled herself
from her family,

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.423
so they are interfering in her promotion.

00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:21.300
As a family of Jujutsu Sorcerers,

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:23.802
wouldn't they welcome
someone strong like her?

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.889
They won't acknowledge people
who were denied before.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:28.432
Because they are fools.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.477 line:20%
But if Maki does well
in the Goodwill Event

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.146 line:20%
and her reputation spreads,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.316 line:20%
it will be harder for others
to suppress her.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.736
For this reason,
we must first win the team battle.

00:13:40.819 --> 00:13:43.822
You better put
your life on the line again!

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:44.990
Yes.

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.742
I heard it.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.495
Gosh.

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.999
<i>Don't think about nonsense.</i>

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:55.918
What's…

00:13:56.001 --> 00:13:57.753
so funny?

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.389
So what if you can hide in my blind spot?

00:14:08.973 --> 00:14:10.683
Trying to distance yourself from me?

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:11.850
Are you an idiot?

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.020
<i>Down there?</i>

00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:20.192
<i>I knew.</i>

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:24.697
<i>Maki has the talent I lack.</i>

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:26.824
Have you heard?

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:28.576
About Ogi's daughters.

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.995
One of them not only
doesn't have cursed techniques,

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.329
she can't even see curses.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.790
Are twins really a bad omen?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.710 line:20%
Maybe it's better this way.

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:41.046 line:20%
She wouldn't even be noticed
since she'll serve the eldest son.

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:46.802
Mai.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:50.306
What's wrong? Hurry up.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:55.185
-I don't want to.
-What's the matter?

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.897
You'll get scolded again if you're late.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.316
There's something over there.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.945
Again?

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:09.199
Guess there's no choice.

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.160
Not at home…

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.704
Come on. Close your eyes.

00:15:13.787 --> 00:15:14.788
What?

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.503
If you can't see it,
then it doesn't exist.

00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.092
<i>You seemed fearless since childhood.</i>

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:30.512
<i>You stride towards the future.</i>

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.557
<i>I hated you.</i>

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:38.062
Are you leaving this house, Maki?

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.814
There are plenty of people doing chores.

00:15:40.898 --> 00:15:45.527
Don't worry. I'll be back soon, Master.

00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:49.448
Why bother coming back?

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:52.910
I'll become the head of the Zenin Family!

00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.334
Then I'll put you to the test.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.796
As you wish.

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.256
Mai is no exception.

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:11.387
This has nothing to do with her.

00:16:20.729 --> 00:16:22.022
Liar.

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.610 line:20%
<i>I hate you!</i>

00:17:13.198 --> 00:17:16.201
<i>You've fired your sixth bullet.
I won't let you reload!</i>

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.703
<i>I…</i>

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:21.165
<i>hate you!</i>

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:23.959
<i>So…</i>

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.796
<i>Whether it's my first love</i>

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.757
<i>or my cursed technique…</i>

00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:34.136
<i>I'll never tell you!</i>

00:17:35.512 --> 00:17:37.556
<i>Construction.</i>

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:41.018
<i>It allows one to construct something
from scratch using cursed energy.</i>

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:46.648
<i>Unlike creating objects
within a Domain Expansion,</i>

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:50.110
<i>things that are constructed by
this technique</i>

00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:52.905
<i>will not disappear
after the technique is finished.</i>

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:57.034
<i>On top of that, it consumes
an immense amount of cursed energy.</i>

00:17:57.117 --> 00:17:59.036
<i>It puts a huge strain on the user's body.</i>

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:03.040
<i>Mai can only construct one bullet a day.</i>

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:05.918 line:20%
<i>As a distraction,</i>

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.046 line:20%
<i>she uses a revolver,
which obviously contains six bullets.</i>

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.008
<i>It's my victory.</i>

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.392
<i>She caught the bullet with her hand?</i>

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.311 line:20%
This hurts…

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.524 line:20%
I shouldn't grab it with my hand.

00:18:33.153 --> 00:18:36.740
<i>Maki has the talent I lack.</i>

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.784
<i>Just like Mechamaru,</i>

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.370
<i>perhaps it's a reverse form
of Heavenly Restriction.</i>

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:45.374
<i>You're supposed to be born
with a cursed technique,</i>

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.963 line:20%
<i>but in return, you received
superhuman physical abilities.</i>

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:54.591 line:20%
<i>A talent rejected by the Zenin Family…</i>

00:18:55.175 --> 00:18:57.052
<i>And a talent…</i>

00:18:57.928 --> 00:18:59.721
<i>that I lack.</i>

00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:03.976
It's obvious who's the winner, right?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.231
Why did you run away from home?

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.440
What?

00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.192
You know that, don't you?

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:13.986
You came to Jujutsu High too.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:14.987 line:20%
I…

00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:18.323
I never wanted to be a Jujutsu Sorcerer!

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:20.993
<i>It's all your fault!</i>

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.828
<i>Because you worked hard,</i>

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:25.122
<i> I had to work hard too!</i>

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:30.043
I don't want to work hard,
suffer, or be afraid anymore!

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.089
What's wrong with being a servant at home?

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:38.010
Just do odd jobs and live casually!

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:45.559
Why didn't you fall down with me?

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.317
If I do that…

00:19:54.401 --> 00:19:57.070
I would grow to hate myself.

00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.198
That's all.

00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:02.034
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.163 --> 00:20:09.583
Don't let go, Maki.

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:11.210
I won't let go.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:12.711
You must not let go.

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:14.755
You're annoying.

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:17.883
You can't leave me behind, okay?

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:19.885
Of course.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.595
We're sisters.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.560
<i>Liar.</i>

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:31.605

<i>What?</i>

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:37.397
Sorry.

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:40.859
Can you be more sincere?

00:22:40.942 --> 00:22:43.737
Here. Don't be angry.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.616
No, thanks. It's not good to eat
cup noodles at midnight.

00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:51.620
Try this then!

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:54.623
<i>Nishimiya-style seafood cup noodles!</i>

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:59.836
<i>First, cut the chili into flakes
and add them to the seafood cup noodles.</i>

00:23:00.504 --> 00:23:04.132
<i>Second, pour milk
into about half of the container.</i>

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:07.385
<i>Third, pour water
until the inner dotted line.</i>

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:10.639
<i>As milk is added,
hot boiling water is needed.</i>

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.895
<i>It's delicious!</i>

00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:20.774
-This is delicious!
-I know, right?

00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:22.901
Maybe I'll try it next time, too.

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:26.863
Since it's so delicious,
you should have just eaten this instead.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:33.120 line:20%
No, I'll feel miserable the next day
if I eat cup noodles at midnight.

00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:35.122
I agree.
