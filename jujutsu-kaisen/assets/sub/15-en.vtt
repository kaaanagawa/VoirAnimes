00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:10.552 line:20%
One minute to go.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:14.389
Well then, Ms. Utahime Iori,

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:17.892
please give us a touching
and encouraging speech.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:18.810
What?

00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:21.563
Well…

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.189
<i>Well…</i>

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:26.401
<i>Although injuries are inevitable…</i>

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.737
<i>Well…</i>

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.613
<i>Just help each other from time to time.</i>

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.073
<i>Something like that?</i>

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.575
<i>Time's up.</i>

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.578
<i>Gojo, you…</i>

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.956
<i>With that,
the Sister-School Goodwill Event…</i>

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:43.626
<i>begins!</i>

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.545
<i>Show some respect to your seniors!</i>

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:47.172
Was that Ichiro?

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.715
Idiot.

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:50.884
Where's Todo?

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.762
Why do you assume I would know?

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:55.472
<i>Let's get along well.</i>

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.983
Where could the Cursed Spirits' boss be?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.570
I think it will be placed
in the middle of both teams.

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.822
But it probably won't stay still.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.076
When the time comes,
divide into Panda team and Megumi team

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.994
since they are good at finding enemies.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.997
We'll leave the rest to you, Yuji.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.373
Got it!

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:29.798
Where are you going?

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.383 line:20%
That's a small fry.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:38.640
Stop, Maki!

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.818
All right! Seems like everyone's here.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.320
Come at me together!

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.201
Split up!

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.623
Todo's alone.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.584
It was the right choice to change to Yuji.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.508
I already knew this, but he's a monster.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.010
Yes. So ignore them.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.949 line:20%
BEFORE THE TEAM BATTLE

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:04.994 line:20%
<i>Todo will definitely rush to defeat us.</i>

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.831
Mai might also follow him
to come after me.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.543
<i>Todo is a monster.</i>

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:17.715
<i>In the worst-case scenario,
everyone will be wiped out.</i>

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.431
Originally, I planned to leave Panda
or Megumi to hold him. But now…

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.519
Itadori, this task will be yours.

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:30.478
What?

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:34.232
I don't want to remove people
who can find the enemy.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:39.320
You don't have to beat him.
Just hold him back for a while.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:41.406
But you need to be bold.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.200
To put it bluntly, you're unexpected help,

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:46.411
so it won't affect us
if you have to retire.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.662
That's too much!

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.123
I'm sorry, Megumi.

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.542
You wanted to fight Todo, didn't you?

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.420
No, I don't mind it.

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.005
You're so calm.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:01.384
But, Panda, since I'm fighting him…

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.635
-What?
-What?

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.471
I'll win.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:11.144
Your speed is quite good.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.689
<i>Are you serious?
I hit pretty hard just now.</i>

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.239
Payback time, first-year student.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.907
Try your best to defend!

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.343
<i>My hand's still intact, right?</i>

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.680
<i>I thought it flew off.</i>

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:51.434
<i>If the Cursed Spirit wasn't there,
I would've been in big trouble.</i>

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.802
Over already?

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:35.853
All right. Who's next?

00:06:41.859 --> 00:06:43.611
Are you serious?

00:06:51.035 --> 00:06:54.872
You keep punching my head.

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.792
What if I become dumber?

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.378
Don't worry.

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:05.383
Takada said,
"It's better for a boy to be stupid."

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:07.051
Who's that?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.387 line:20%
I'm not interested in idols.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.056 line:20%
Then why do you know she's an idol?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.100 line:20%
You know her, don't you?

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:17.145
What's your name, first-year?

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.646
Yuji Itadori.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.107
I see. Yuji Itadori.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.651
I have a question for you.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.655
What type of woman do you like?

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.740
What?

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.160
What type of woman?

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.662
Why are you asking this now?

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:38.166
Don't mind me.
It's just my way of evaluating people.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:44.672 line:20%
I don't understand,
but if I had to choose…

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:52.763
A girl with big head
and big butt, perhaps?

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.099
Someone like Jennifer Lawrence.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.645
What?

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.822 line:20%
SHOUNEN WEEKLY MAGAZINE

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:12.909
The new series is quite interesting.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:13.826
Really?

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:17.663
-What?
-What?

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:32.553
I'm going to confess to Takada.

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.889
What? Don't do that!

00:08:34.972 --> 00:08:38.267 line:20%
I don't want to comfort you.
It's troublesome.

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.978
Why are you sure that I would get dumped?

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.984
On the other hand,
why do you think she would agree?

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.696
Anne Sullivan once said this
to Helen Keller.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:55.201
"How can a fool think about losing
before he does it?"

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.036
That's what Inoki said.

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.206
I'm sorry.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.500
I already have someone I like.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.145
Is it possible
that I'm that someone she likes?

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.439
How could it be possible?

00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.403 line:20%
Come on. Let's go.

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.949
I'll buy you ramen.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:54.343
"At home, we are invincible…"

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:00.766
Looks like we're best friends.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.852
Even though you just asked for my name?

00:10:04.645 --> 00:10:06.689
Just go straight.

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:08.274
But Todo is there.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:12.236
It's okay. He's the one who said
we can do as we please.

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.955
<i>New Shadow Style, Simple Domain!</i>

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.417
<i>Batto Sword Drawing!</i>

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:33.507
<i>His response is quick!</i>

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:35.092
<i>Although I hesitated,</i>

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.511
<i>my attack didn't scratch him at all!</i>

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.810
<i>I'm surrounded.</i>

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:48.814
<i>What? These guys…</i>

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.316
<i>Aren't they…</i>

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:55.780
<i>trying to kill me?</i>

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:02.703
<i>This technique…</i>

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:03.704
<i>What?</i>

00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.207
<i>I swapped positions with Itadori!</i>

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:08.876
Hey.

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.129
I told you, didn't I?

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.465
I'll kill you if you get in my way.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.550
No.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:19.470
You said, "I'll kill you if you order me."

00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.347
<i>Was that Itadori?</i>

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.600
<i>No, was that Todo's cursed technique?</i>

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:27.311
It's all the same. Leave!

00:11:34.777 --> 00:11:36.070
Retreating?

00:11:36.153 --> 00:11:37.154
Lame.

00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:39.115
<i>I'm so glad!</i>

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:41.909
You must kill him.

00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:44.578
That depends on Itadori.

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.414
Don't order me around.

00:11:46.497 --> 00:11:48.290
<i>What's wrong with these guys?</i>

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.918
<i>They want to kill me,
yet they're infighting.</i>

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.840
After all,
I'm not the kind of tasteless man

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:58.134
who shows mercy to his best friend!

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.641
Oh, man.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:08.394
That's why I said stay out of it.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.813
What a bad start.

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:13.983 line:20%
<i>Since I'm in charge
of hunting Cursed Spirits,</i>

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.152
<i>I need to find them from the air first.</i>

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:20.698
This is so troublesome.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:24.076
I'm going to work hard.
I'm cute today, as usual.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.369
Knock her down.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:28.789
Oh, no!

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.544
Mai and Mechamaru, go help Nishimiya.

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:37.214
-Understood.
-Okay, we need her anyway.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:50.186
Kamo.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:54.482
Are you guys planning to kill Itadori?

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.532
Something is wrong.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.284
Something is weird.

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.037
Kyoto team is moving as a whole.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:11.207
They are around the area
we separated from Yuji.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.626
Isn't everyone from Kyoto team there?

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.962
Is the target there?

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.422
No.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.799
Unless the Grade 2 Cursed Spirit
is cunning,

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.510
the Divine Dog will detect it.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:28.307
Are they trying to kill Itadori?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.809
What's this? This is absurd.

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:36.815
It's possible.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.317
Kelp.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:42.321
It's that I didn't feel hostility
from them,

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:46.325
but that was before Yuji's
survival surprise.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:52.331
It's possible if that was
Principal Gakuganji's instruction.

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:58.337
Is Kyoto team a group of cowards
who will obey orders to kill people?

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.631
Our perceptions are different.

00:14:00.714 --> 00:14:04.343
You lived with Yuji before.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:08.055
We only just knew that he's a good guy.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:10.975 line:20%
He's cheerful,
and that's rare among Jujutsu Sorcerers.

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.351
However,

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:15.854
<i>for those who don't know Yuji,</i>

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:20.359
<i>Sukuna's vessel is a scary existence.</i>

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.738
<i>It's similar to exorcising curses.</i>

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:30.369
<i>It's easy for Jujutsu Sorcerers
to cross the line in the first place.</i>

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.708
Megumi, let's go back.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.668
I'm sorry.

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:39.795
What are you apologizing for?

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.339
If our comrade dies,

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:44.842
what's the point
of winning the Goodwill Event?

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:50.472
Nobara and I will go confirm
Yuji's safety.

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.766
He's not answering his phone.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.270
Toge will carry on to hunt Cursed Spirits.

00:14:56.854 --> 00:14:57.938
Bonito flakes.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:00.900
I know you're worried about Yuji too.

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:04.153
But if my guess is right,

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:10.409
they're trying to assassinate Yuji
in the chaos of team battle.

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:14.079
There won't be any assassination
if the team battle ends.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.456
I see.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:16.415
Salmon.

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:18.083
I'm worried about Maki, too.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.046
We can't let them kill Yuji,
and we'll win the team battle.

00:15:22.546 --> 00:15:23.923
Of course.

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:31.013
Answer the call once it rings, Fushiguro!

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:36.894
Speaking of which, why didn't the school
provide a radio or Bluetooth headset?

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:39.104
I don't want it.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:41.941
It's distracting
and I'll be shocked when it rings.

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.401
Just take it off during the battle!

00:15:49.365 --> 00:15:50.824
That hurt.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:55.537
<i>So that's Fushiguro's Nue…</i>

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:57.873
<i>The wings are electrified.</i>

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.834
<i>It will affect my movements temporarily.</i>

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:08.008
-Nishimiya!
-Nishimiya!

00:16:08.592 --> 00:16:11.512
-Let's play.
-Let's play.

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:14.765
<i>So uncultivated and not cute.</i>

00:16:15.432 --> 00:16:19.228
Kamo, are you guys trying to kill Itadori?

00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.232 line:20%
What if I say yes?

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.317
You failed.

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:28.737
Itadori won't be killed so easily.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.660
We have no reason to kill him.

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.578
There is a reason.

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:39.456
At least, the higher-ups
and the Big Three Sorcerer Family do.

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:13.741
<i>What great endurance.</i>

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:16.493
<i>He also takes advantage
of the terrain actively!</i>

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:19.621
<i>He's gone.</i>

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:25.169 line:20%
<i>He also follows up
with the next attack quickly.</i>

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.595
<i>The best part is…</i>

00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:39.641
<i>this amazing power!</i>

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:42.478
<i>This tiny body has stronger power than me.</i>

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.647
<i>So he can cause a blow
with a small amount of cursed energy.</i>

00:17:46.148 --> 00:17:50.569 line:20%
<i>So it's difficult to predict his actions
from the cursed energy flow!</i>

00:17:50.652 --> 00:17:54.114
<i>However, this delayed cursed energy…</i>

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.159
<i>Only this…</i>

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:01.789
It's wrong!

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:08.504
It's wrong!

00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:16.220
Was that Todo?

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.097
I guess so.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:23.268
I vaguely understand
why you can't get rid of Yuji.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:27.564
So why did you separate from Noritoshi?

00:18:27.648 --> 00:18:30.692
Are you hiding your cursed techniques
from your own people?

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:37.950
I'm sorry about Itadori.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.204
It may sound like an excuse,
but I'm not like the others.

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:47.292
However, I don't intend
to let you guys win the Goodwill Event.

00:18:47.793 --> 00:18:48.919 line:20%
RECOMMENDATION

00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:52.714 line:20%
<i>You know a Jujutsu Sorcerer's promotion
depends on recommendations, right?</i>

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:55.384
<i>Even Jujutsu Sorcerers
with no direct contact</i>

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:58.053
<i>will know about the Goodwill Event.</i>

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.973 line:20%
<i>Students who stand out
in the Goodwill Event</i>

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:04.726
<i>have a higher chance for promotion
during the schooling period.</i>

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:10.065
By the way, you can't recommend
your own students.

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:15.237
For example, Mr. Gojo
can't recommend Itadori to Grade 1.

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:20.242
I want to be independent
as soon as possible and earn a living.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.831
Why?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.960
Because I'm poor.

00:19:30.043 --> 00:19:31.753
And I have two younger brothers!

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:33.672
Are you okay?

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:35.799
Are you getting along with Mai?

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.426
Aren't you being too nice?

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.385
What?

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.220
I guess.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.599
I won't go easy on you.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.310
No problem.

00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:49.104
I'm not saying this
to make you show mercy.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.066
My friend.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.988
That delayed cursed energy
is your bad habit!

00:19:58.071 --> 00:19:59.615
You mean the Divergent Fist?

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.993
<i>What's with this guy?</i>

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:08.373
You can never beat me
so long as you're satisfied with this.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:15.380
We're no longer best friends
if you're satisfied with this level.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.299
Are you fine with that?

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:20.385
What should I do? I'm okay with that.

00:20:20.469 --> 00:20:23.513
-Are you fine staying this weak?
-What?

00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:28.602
I'm not.

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:31.939
Right?

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:35.901
My best friend!

00:22:06.783 --> 00:22:08.410
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:12.664
QUESTION
WHAT KIND OF PERSON DO YOU LIKE?

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:16.501
Someone that's at least stronger than me.

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.170
What?

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.173
Why should I tell you?

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.968 line:20%
I hate guys that are good-for-nothings,
poor, stinky, petty, and dead.

00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:28.764
Do you know Sebastian Stan?

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:32.100
He has a great body.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:38.023
Well, it's normal to like handsome guys.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:41.818
I mean it's fun to be
with someone like him.

00:22:41.902 --> 00:22:45.447
But more importantly,
he has to make me feel that

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.575
he's the only one for me!

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:50.535
What?

00:22:50.619 --> 00:22:53.663
Oh, my! You're making me embarrassed!

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.540
Well…

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:58.126
You see, well…

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:59.753
What was it again?

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.880
Well…

00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:03.381
You know…

00:23:03.465 --> 00:23:05.467
That one who looks nice.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.095
The one with the unique bangs. Come on.

00:23:08.178 --> 00:23:09.429
You know, right?

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:14.392
Someone who looks nice…

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:33.036
Oh, Miwa?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.621
That's right!
