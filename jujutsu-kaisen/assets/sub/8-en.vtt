WEBVTT

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.924
TOKYO PREFECTURAL JUJUTSU HIGH SCHOOL

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.385
Here we go.

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.433
Can't we have more vending machines?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.603
No way, not many can enter
this school anyway.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.188
What?

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:24.357
Where are the first-year students?

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.734
I sent them on an errand.

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:26.943
Bonito flakes.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.237
-Will it be okay?
-Salmon.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.241
They are not three-year-old kids.
They know how to run errands.

00:00:33.324 --> 00:00:35.326
That's not what I meant.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:38.955
Isn't the principal of
Kyoto Jujutsu High School coming today?

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.956
What?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.459
The meeting for the Goodwill Event.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.380
<i>That abnormal case where
the first-year students were dispatched.</i>

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:51.176
<i>Wasn't it done by the higher-ups
who have a tense relationship with Satoru?</i>

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.722
The principal of Kyoto
is part of the higher-ups, right?

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.058
If they bump into each other…

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.979
<i>Itadori, the first-year student
they targeted, is dead.</i>

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.566
<i>They probably don't plan
to do anything to Megumi and Kugisaki.</i>

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.028
Even the old man in Kyoto

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.239
won't cause trouble,
at least on the surface.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:14.574
Salmon.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.786
The teachers may have
their own standpoints,

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.913
but not necessarily the students.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.832
Do you mean Mai is here?

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:24.751
It's just my guess.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:27.796
After all, the meeting
has nothing to do with the students.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.799
However…

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.594
<i>Don't they like to harass people?</i>

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.013
<i>Todo and Mai.</i>

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.475
Why are you here, Zenin?

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:41.935
Oh, I knew it.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.021
She gives off a similar vibe.
Are they sisters?

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.272
They are twins.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.983
Gosh, Fushiguro.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.653
If you call me that,
it will be the same as Maki.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.531
Call me "Mai."

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:58.159
These two are the substitutes for Okkotsu
and the third-year students?

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.830
We followed the principal here
because we were worried about you.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:04.165
Your classmate died, right?

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.669
Are you sad? Or maybe not?

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.839
What are you trying to say?

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.340
It's okay.

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:14.717
There are things that can be hard to say.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.719
I'll say it on your behalf instead.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.305
<i>The term "vessel" sounds good,</i>

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:22.142
<i>but to speak crudely,
he's just a half-cursed monster, right?</i>

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.187
Such a dirty and inhuman thing.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.023
Yet he calls himself
a Jujutsu Sorcerer, like you.

00:02:29.107 --> 00:02:30.942
He must have made you disgusted.

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.445 line:20%
Isn't it good riddance that he's dead?

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.577
Mai, stop talking about useless stuff.

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.247
I only want to know

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.541
if they are good enough
to replace Okkotsu.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.544
That's all!

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.423
Your name is Fushiguro, right?

00:02:54.424 --> 00:02:56.551
What kind of woman do you like?

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.220
-What?
-What?

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:04.225
Based on your answer, I might beat you up
until you're half dead right here.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.185
Okkotsu…

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.981
At worst, I'll drag the third-year
students to the Goodwill Event.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:13.902 line:20%
By the way…

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.615
I like tall women with big butts!

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.712 line:20%
I just met you for the first time today.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.506 line:20%
Why should I tell you
about the kind of girl I like?

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.882
What?

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:02.844
Yes, you're making things difficult
for this boring man.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.595
Shut up.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.890
The situation is already weird enough.
Stop making it worse.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.644 line:20%
I'm Aoi Todo, a third-year student
at Kyoto Jujutsu High School.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:13.521
That's all for my self-introduction.

00:05:13.604 --> 00:05:15.315
We're friends now.

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:18.067 line:20%
Hurry up and answer.
It's okay if it's a man.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.697
<i>Sexual preferences
can reflect one's personality.</i>

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.826
<i>Someone who has boring tastes
in women is boring!</i>

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.789
I hate boring men the most!

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.795
<i>The Goodwill Event is a special show
for me to show my passion and soul.</i>

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.674
If you make me bored
in my last Goodwill Event,

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.302
I don't know what's going to happen.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.346
Hey. Jujutsu high schools
adopt a four-year program, right?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.932
You can only participate
until your third year.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.559
I see.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.855
As a form of consideration,
I can still leave you half dead.

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:59.233
Answer me, Fushiguro.
What kind of woman do you like?

00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.069
What's this? A variety show?

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.988
Is that a summer uniform?

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.741
I'm annoyed, but I'm jealous.

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:09.243
<i>Kugisaki's unarmed right now.</i>

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:10.995
<i>We need to avoid a fight.</i>

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.750
It's not a bad thing
to be unable to forgive someone.

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.211
Isn't that part of your kindness too?

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:23.466
I don't have any preferences.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.844
As long as she isn't easily swayed,

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.971
I don't ask for anything else.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.434
That's a good answer.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.354
I would kill him if he said
he likes big breasts or something.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.147
Shut up.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:41.359
I knew it.

00:06:43.194 --> 00:06:46.781
You're so boring, Fushiguro.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:55.289
Fushiguro!

00:06:56.374 --> 00:06:59.836 line:20%
Oh, man. I feel so bad for Fushiguro.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.966
He's a genius who enrolled
as a Grade 2 Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:09.470
and yet he's nothing but a first-year
in front of our Grade 1 Todo.

00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.473
I should console him later.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.935
I thought you two are alike,
but I was wrong.

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:19.313
Maki's a hundred times
more beautiful than you.

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:23.568 line:20%
Do you lack sleep? Your pores are huge.

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.155 line:20%
I'll teach you…

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:30.658
how to talk nicely.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.123
I knew it when I first saw you.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.917
"This guy is so boring."

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.963
However,
I can't judge a book by its cover.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:47.383
That's why I asked.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.846
But you trampled on my kindness.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.892
Don't tell me
your brain's made of pineapple, too.

00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:58.811
<i>Todo?</i>

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.813 line:20%
<i>Is he that Todo?</i>

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:02.899
<i>Last year,</i>

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.152
<i>Geto started an unprecedented
cursed technique terrorist attack.</i>

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:09.030
<i>During the Shinjuku-to-Kyoto
Night Line of a Hundred Demons,</i>

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.533
<i>he exorcised five Grade 1 Cursed Spirits</i>

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.745
<i>and one Special Grade Cursed Spirit.</i>

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.747
<i>He's that Todo?</i>

00:08:18.247 --> 00:08:21.792
<i>But it's not unusual for a Grade 1
Sorcerer to defeat a Special Grade.</i>

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:23.753
<i>What's amazing is that…</i>

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.923
I heard you don't use cursed techniques.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.090
What?

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.676
Oh, that rumor is fake.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.179
I used it against a Special Grade.

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:36.432
<i>You don't use it on Grade 1 Curses?
What a monster!</i>

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.559
I'm so relieved.

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:40.728
Nue…

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.689
and Toad.

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:49.570
The Well's Unknown Abyss.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.033
What?

00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:56.327
<i>The opponent focuses
on close-range combat.</i>

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.038
<i>I need to put some distance between us
and move in quickly.</i>

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.671
<i>He's quick! That was not his full speed--</i>

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.173
You're too shallow.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:14.387
Your physique is thin
and your preferences are equally shallow!

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.319
<i>Darn it! He's too strong!</i>

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:45.418
It's not over yet!

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.261
It's always the same.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.971
This is too boring!

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:10.860
I don't sense any enthusiasm in you.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.113
I was just being nice,
and you're acting all high-and-mighty.

00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:16.574
Since you said that…

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.661
Then I'll do it.

00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:25.082
Bring it on!

00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.418
Don't move.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:33.883
What are you doing?

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:39.221
We barely made it.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.765
Bonito flakes.

00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:45.853
But to be honest, I was late.

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:50.191
Long time no see, Panda.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:53.110
Why can't you wait
until the Goodwill Event?

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:54.445
Go back.

00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:55.863
Or I'll scream.

00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:57.406
"Don't!"

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.742
No need to tell me. I'm going back.

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:01.911
Where's my shirt?

00:11:04.413 --> 00:11:07.833
Seems like it won't be that boring
the entire time.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.126
What?

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:14.590
Tell Okkotsu that
he has to attend the event as well.

00:11:15.174 --> 00:11:16.300
<i>It's troublesome.</i>

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:19.303
I'm a panda.
I don't understand human language.

00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:20.596
Salmon.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.229
If you still want to be
a Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:30.731
you should learn to pick your opponent.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.239
What are you doing to my gofer, Mai?

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:39.281
Oh, my.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:43.160
You look so much like a loser
that I didn't realize it was you, Maki.

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.663
The same goes for you.

00:11:45.746 --> 00:11:48.833
You also only know
how to inject cursed energy into tools.

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.876
As if you know crap
about cursed techniques.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.129
It's better than
having no cursed energy at all.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.631
Your neck will feel sore
if you always look up.

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.967
Sometimes, you need to look down too.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.304
Forget it. It's a disgrace
to be arguing among losers.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.557
Can you stand, Nobara?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.685
No way. She's not getting up for a while.

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.603
I taught her a lesson--

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:13.149
What's this? Are you going to fight?

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.029
Nice support, Maki!

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.534
How dare you open so many holes
in the sportswear I just bought!

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:27.371
Give me your uniform.
I'll make that my summer uniform!

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:31.208 line:20%
Next time, I'll add a few holes
to your body.

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.712 line:20%
Besides, you can't wear it
with your short legs--

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:39.049
I'm killing you!

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.302
Let's go back, Mai.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.097
No way…

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.183
My shirt's here.

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:49.518
Where's Fushiguro?

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:52.354
Don't worry.
Panda and Inumaki went to help him.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:54.398
Looks fun here.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:58.569
Are you serious? I'm just about to start.

00:12:58.652 --> 00:12:59.570
You can't.

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:03.324
Unlike you,
I have something important to do in Tokyo.

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.285
There's an…

00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.829 line:20%
individual handshake event with Takada!

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.789 line:20%
TAKADA THE TALL IDOL

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.792
-What?
-I see.

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.882
If I can't get to the venue in time,

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:22.259
there's no telling what I'm going to do.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.179
Come with me, Mai!

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:27.640
Gosh! What a selfish person!

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.436
To think that she skipped
the usual Kyoto for her tour.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.898
Listen, it won't end so easily
during the Goodwill Event.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:38.317 line:20%
Why are you acting like you won?

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.486 line:20%
Leave your uniform behind!

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:42.071
Stop it, you fool.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.823
It brings no benefit to win or lose here.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.992
We'll finish them at the Goodwill Event.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.870
Hey, Maki.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:53.123
Is it true that you have no cursed energy?

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:55.376
Yes.

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:56.544
That's why…

00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:00.214
Without these glasses,
I can't even see curses.

00:14:00.798 --> 00:14:02.633
<i>What I use is called a Cursed Tool.</i>

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:04.885
<i>It's a tool that's imbued with a curse.</i>

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:08.013
Unlike you guys,
I don't use my own cursed energy

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.765
to use sorcery and techniques.

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.603
<i>Is it the same as Itadori's knife?</i>

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.649
Then why did you become
a Jujutsu Sorcerer?

00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.360
I acted in a fit of pique.

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:26.365
If I, who have been looked down upon,
become a great Jujutsu Sorcerer,

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:29.076
I wonder how
my family members would react?

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.369
I can't wait to see that.

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.874
Come on. Let's go to Ms. Shoko.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:41.213
I respect you very much, Maki!

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:42.882
Oh, really?

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.105
Is Yaga still not here?

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.774 line:20%
As an old man with my days numbered,

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:02.610 line:20%
my time is precious.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.074
Principal Yaga won't be coming
for a while.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.493
Really?

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.499
Since I gave him a fake meeting time…

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:19.752
<i>…by threatening Ijichi.</i>

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:23.964
I've been under your care,
Principal Gakuganji.

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:27.092
Let's see. What do you mean by that?

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.011
Don't act dumb, old man.

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.055
It's about Itadori.

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:34.391 line:20%
You're involved in it since you are
the head of the conservative, right?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.437
Dear me.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.650
Youngsters nowadays
can't even speak with respect?

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.611
I don't intend to respect you
from the beginning.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:49.365
Old people nowadays are too arrogant,
it's really a pain in the butt.

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.367
-Hey.
-What?

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.535
This is problematic behavior.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:56.747
We'll report it
to the relevant department.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:02.044 line:20%
<i>Oh, my goodness!
It's Satoru Gojo in person!</i>

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:06.340
Please help yourself.
I don't intend to stay for long.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.886
<i>He talked to me!</i>

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.976
Last night, I was attacked by two
unregistered Special Grade Cursed Spirits.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.394
Is that so?

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:20.688
That's unfortunate.

00:16:21.271 --> 00:16:22.940
Don't be mistaken.

00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:26.694
To me, it's almost like
the usual street interview.

00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:30.322
<i>He's so cool!</i>

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:37.121
<i>Those Cursed Spirits can communicate.
They must have comrades of the same level.</i>

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.709
It's not just our enemies.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.628
Hakari, Okkotsu, and your Todo.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:49.133
In recent years, the level of students
has also improved by leaps and bounds.

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.804
<i>Also, we had
the Suguru Geto incident last year.</i>

00:16:57.349 --> 00:17:00.477
<i>And now,
the appearance of Sukuna's vessel.</i>

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.564
What are you trying to say?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.858
Don't you get it?

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:10.988 line:20%
The power you suppressed
for lame status and tradition

00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:14.283
has begun to grow and surge.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:19.246
<i>"Special Grade" will no longer be
the ceiling for the future generation.</i>

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.791
If you think I'm the only one
who will bare my fangs at you,

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.753
then you're in for a ride, old man.

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:30.758 line:20%
You're talking a little too much.

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:32.760
So frightening.

00:17:32.843 --> 00:17:36.305
I've said everything that I wanted.
I should leave now.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:45.647
By the way, Principal Yaga
will be here in two hours. Bye!

00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:47.649
<i>Two hours?</i>

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:55.657
-Go get me some tea, Miwa.
-Yes, sir.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:01.121
Please excuse me.

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:09.254
<i>If I catch up,
I'll ask to take a photo with him!</i>

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.257
TAKADA'S INDIVIDUAL HANDSHAKE EVENT

00:18:14.301 --> 00:18:17.346
Please do the Takada's beam once.

00:18:17.429 --> 00:18:20.307
Okay, I'll do it now.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.435
Tantaka-tan!

00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:29.024
Time's up.

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.737
ONE MONTH LATER

00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:35.489
RECORD - SEPTEMBER 2018

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:37.866
KINEMA CINEMA
KAWASAKI, KANAGAWA PREFECTURE

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.474
AFTER THE MOVIE SCREENING,

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.103
A STAFF DISCOVERED THREE
PECULIAR BODIES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS

00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.481
CAUSE OF DEATH: INCREASED INTRACRANIAL
PRESSURE AND RESPIRATION PARALYSIS

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:10.983
AS A RESULT OF HEAD DEFORMATION

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.413
Excuse me.

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:28.542
The incident in the cinema…

00:19:30.377 --> 00:19:32.087
Did you do it?

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.595
Wow. So you can see me.

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:53.400
KINEMA CINEMA

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:55.110
It's a horrifying crime scene.

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:58.989
Are you prepared, Itadori?

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:03.619
Yes.

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:44.886
Thank you!

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.596
No problem.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.391
I got it!

00:22:03.196 --> 00:22:04.281
Where's my tea?

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:05.365
Oh, god.

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:08.452
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:09.995
INDIVIDUAL HANDSHAKE EVENT VENUE

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:14.833
There's a beautiful woman
looking at us like trash.

00:22:14.916 --> 00:22:16.209
Don't get too excited.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.211
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mai.

00:22:18.295 --> 00:22:20.881
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

00:22:20.964 --> 00:22:22.966
Ask yourself.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.052
Is the moment finally here?

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:25.969
What?

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:27.471 line:20%
What's this?

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:29.473 line:20%
The next handshake event.

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:32.851
You should go feel
Takada's beauty in person.

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:34.686
<i>It's troublesome.</i>

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.690
This is also a fan
and a future husband's duty.

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.609
<i>How disgusting.</i>

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:44.613
<i>But it will be more troublesome
if I refuse it.</i>

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:45.864
What's wrong?

00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:52.370
I get it.

00:22:53.663 --> 00:22:54.873
What?

00:22:56.249 --> 00:22:57.959
It's a girl!

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.795
Is this your first time?

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:00.879
Yes.

00:23:00.962 --> 00:23:02.714
What's your name?

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:03.840
Mai.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.553
Mai, are you tired?
Was it tiring to wait in line?

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.389
I'm tired of people,
rather than the waiting.

00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:14.851 line:20%
You should come again
when you feel better.

00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:17.395
I'll remember you, Mai.

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.898
You're back, Mai.

00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:21.441
How was it?

00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:22.901
Nothing special.

00:23:24.361 --> 00:23:28.865
Takada is indeed a woman
who can't be easily described in words.

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:35.914
<i>That wasn't all too bad.</i>
