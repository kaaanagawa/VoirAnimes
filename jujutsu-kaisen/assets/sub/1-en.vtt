00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.670
Good morning.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.346
What?

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.232
Which one are you right now?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.194
You look like…

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.198
I'm Satoru Gojo, the person in charge
of the first-years at Jujutsu High.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:34.492
Jujutsu…

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.454
Fushiguro--

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.580
What?

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.168
What is this?

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:49.591
It is not the time to worry
about other people, Yuji Itadori.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.220
A secret execution
has been imposed on you.

<i>Hello, this is Sugisawa--</i>

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:31.818 line:20%
<i>I'm Itadori.</i>

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.236
The one who just called.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.572
Yes.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:39.325
I haven't heard any reply.
Did my grandpa say anything?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.328
That's strange. I've told him.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.708
Wait. I'll ask.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.213
Mr. Itadori never rings the nurse's bell.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.090
It's actually kind of scary.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.676
Mr. Itadori, you have a call.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.303
Yuji is asking if there's anything

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.305
-you want him to bring--
-So noisy!

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.806
Tell him not to come.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.225
<i>Enjoy the club activities. Join the club.</i>

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.729
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:03:08.813 --> 00:03:11.524
<i>Did you hear that, Yuji?
And the one about the club?</i>

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:13.943
Thank you.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.321
I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.658
MIYAGI SUGISAWA MUNICIPAL HIGH SCHOOL

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:35.256
It's silly to keep a Special Grade Curse
in a place like this.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.508
What?

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.687
-I couldn't find it.
<i>-What?</i>

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.023
The instrument shelter is empty.

00:03:52.106 --> 00:03:53.233
<i>Are you serious?</i>

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.860
<i>That's funny.
Maybe it went for a walk at night?</i>

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.153
I'm going to hit you.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.573
<i>Well, you can't come back without that.</i>

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:05.119
I'll punch him next time.

CONGRATULATIONS, SOCCER CLUB

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.918
<i>It's about to start.</i>

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:13.878
<i>Are you ready?</i>

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:16.005
Sasaki.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.132
Iguchi.

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:20.385
Here we go.

00:04:20.468 --> 00:04:22.512
Spirits.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.139
Tell me what animal
the council president is afraid of.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.851
-Naked.
-Sea.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.228
-Butterfly.
-Butterfly.

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:33.481 line:20%
Naked sea butterfly? That is so lame.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:34.482
Occult Club!

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:37.443
Hey, it's the plankton president!
What's up?

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:38.403
NOTICE

00:04:38.486 --> 00:04:41.114
This research club
doesn't have any real-world activity.

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:43.783
We'll take back the activity room
according to the notice.

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.159
Please withdraw quickly.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:49.455
You shouldn't underestimate
my seniors, President.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.207
STRANGE EVENT ARCHIVES

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.126
What's that?

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:57.714
You know the rugby field
is locked up, right?

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.676
<i>Yes, because all the players
have been hospitalized with sickness.</i>

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.636
Don't you find it strange?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.014
Rugby players are strong and healthy.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:09.225
<i>It is said that they heard
strange noises and cries…</i>

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:10.393
BONK

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.896
<i>…before they fell ill.</i>

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.317 line:20%
Let's take a look at this news report
from 30 years ago.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.903
The disappearance of Mr. Yoshida
from the construction company.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.239
The last witness information
comes from here.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:25.908
Sugisawa Municipal High School
during construction.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:26.909
What?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.995 line:20%
<i>Mr. Yoshida, who was running out of money,</i>

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.915 line:20%
<i>loaned from loan sharks
and was targeted by the group behind it.</i>

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.085
This series of disturbances

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:41.257 line:20%
was the grievance of Mr. Yoshida,
who was buried under the rugby field.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.426 line:20%
No, it's Ixodes.

00:05:45.094 --> 00:05:46.387
<i>Ixodes.</i>

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.306
<i>A large, blood-sucking insect.</i>

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.267
<i>SFTS caused by a bite could be fatal.</i>

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.310
<i>Be careful.</i>

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:53.770
So what?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:56.022
The club is trying
to unravel psychic phenomena.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:58.191
That's a serious
activity report, isn't it?

00:05:58.274 --> 00:05:59.859
This is no place for child's play!

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:01.694
The biggest problem, in the end, is…

00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:03.071
-Yuji Itadori!
-What?

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:05.698
You're not in the Occult Club,
you're in track and field.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:08.701
So this club did not meet
the minimum requirement

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.161
of three people as stated.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.079
What?

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:12.497
Itadori.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.665
No, I wrote the Occult Club.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.667 line:20%
I rewrote it.

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.087
Takagi, the track and field coach.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.048
Itadori, we need you
to win this national competition!

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.718
<i>A teacher who is worse
than the students appears…</i>

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.138
You're so annoying!
How many times do I have to say no?

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.681
-You can't say no!
-I can't?

00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:32.642
But I'm not a demon either.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:35.103
If you win,
I'll give up making you participate.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:38.606
Let's compete fair and square,
with track-and-field items!

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:41.275
Sounds interesting. Let's do this!

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:43.402
TRACK AND FIELD COACH TAKAGI VS. ITADORI

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:47.949
<i>Is it a good thing
to rewrite people's applications?</i>

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.997
<i>What's wrong with the rugby field?</i>

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.710
<i>Is a corpse buried down there?</i>

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.088
<i>Even so,</i>

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.135
<i>this curse is supposed to be
a Grade 2 Curse.</i>

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.554
<i>Is that the effect of the curse?</i>

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:15.059 line:20%
<i>I can't pinpoint the location
because the cursed breath is too strong.</i>

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:19.147 line:20%
<i>It could be at your feet
or in the distance.</i>

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.400
<i>This Special Grade Curse is too tricky.</i>

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:26.571 line:20%
<i>Who brought it out? Where is it now?</i>

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.781
Come!

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.034
Takagi and Itadori are competing.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.203
What are they competing for?

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.790
Okay.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.460
Fourteen meters.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:41.961 line:20%
JAPAN RECORDS
18M, 85CM

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:44.755
Takagi is so strong,
old but still vigorous.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.965
Itadori, can you do it?

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:48.634
-Is Itadori famous?
-Itadori!

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.637
I just heard that
he made it through <i>SASUKE</i>.

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.432
They call him
the reincarnation of Mirko Cro Cop.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.851
Mirko hasn't died yet, right?

00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.062
He's called
the "Tiger of West Junior High."

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.189
Too corny!

00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:03.524
Can I just throw it out?

00:08:03.608 --> 00:08:06.694
Well, there's no rule
to decide how to throw it.

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:11.657
Sorry for choosing your unprofessional
category to convey my sincerity.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:16.662
Well…

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.165 line:20%
That's about 30 meters.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:21.626
-Okay! I won!
-What?

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:23.586
He's a gorilla, not a tiger.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.630
That was the pitcher's move
just now, right?

00:08:26.214 --> 00:08:29.133
Itadori, you're more suitable
for sports clubs.

00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.220
You don't have to force yourself
to stay at the Occult Club.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.262
What?

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:35.932
You two like horror stories,

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:39.101
but you can't go
to haunted places without me.

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.728
I'm scared because I like it.

00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.648
And our school says that
it's compulsory to join a club, right?

00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.358
I can't play this kind of thing.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:48.236
You don't have to do anything,
just a "ghost member."

00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.946
It's the Occult Club anyway.

00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:51.864
That's what I said.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.951
I have to go home by five
for personal reasons.

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.869
If you don't mind, let me stay.

00:08:56.953 --> 00:09:00.122
I also like the atmosphere
of the Occult Club.

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:02.625
We don't mind that.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.001
Yes.

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:06.587
<i>That guy is amazing.</i>

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.465
<i>He can do that much without cursed energy?</i>

00:09:09.549 --> 00:09:11.968
<i>Maybe he's similar to Zenin.</i>

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:14.637
It's late!

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.348
I'm leaving early
since I have matters to attend to, Coach!

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:28.442
<i>The breath of the cursed object.</i>

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.902
Hey, slow down.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.529
Isn't he too fast?

00:09:31.612 --> 00:09:34.448
I heard that guy ran
50 meters in 3 seconds.

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.825 line:20%
Is he a person or a car?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.380
SUGISAWA HOSPITAL

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:51.382
I told you not to come.

00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:53.926
Don't keep buying flowers.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.344
It's the same as usual.

00:09:55.428 --> 00:09:58.097
The flowers aren't for you,
they are for the nurse.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.890
That's even more redundant, you fool!

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:03.144
What happened to your club?
Enjoy the club activities.

00:10:03.227 --> 00:10:06.814
Stop nagging. It was over at five.

00:10:06.897 --> 00:10:10.026
I wouldn't have come to see you
if I didn't have time.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.235
Okay.

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:14.238
You'll just have to listen to me,
a man of leisure.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:15.823
I'm not interested.

00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:17.366
Listen to me carefully.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.702
I have one last thing to tell you.

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.495
About your parents--

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.248
I told you I'm not interested.

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:28.210
Please don't act all cool
before you die, okay?

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:33.924
Men are supposed to die acting cool.
Don't you understand, my damn grandson?

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.177
Don't get angry all the time.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:38.679
Just be yourself.

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.059
The pressure-free generation
is ridiculous!

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.650
Yuji.

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:51.651
Yes?

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:54.862
You're strong enough to save others.

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.906
As far as you can go…

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:59.158
If you can, try to save them.

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:00.451
It's okay to be confused.

00:11:00.534 --> 00:11:03.245
Don't worry about it
if you don't get any gratitude.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.499
Anyway, try to save more people.

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:10.461
You're going to die
in front of a crowd of people.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.506
Don't be like me.

00:11:24.558 --> 00:11:25.601
Grandpa.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.062
NURSE CALL

00:11:28.687 --> 00:11:30.648
Yes? What's wrong?

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.277
Hello, Mr. Itadori?

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.824
<i>Are you there?</i>

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:45.246
<i>Grandpa passed away.</i>

00:12:07.768 --> 00:12:09.687 line:20%
DEATH CERTIFICATE

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:14.358
Well, that's all the documents I need.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:16.735
Okay, thank you for your care.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:18.446
Are you really okay?

00:12:19.029 --> 00:12:21.449
It's the first time
I'm experiencing a loss,

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.452
so maybe
it doesn't feel like it's real yet.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:29.331
But my grandpa's going to get mad
at me for frowning so much.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.042
I'll just smile while I burn him up.

00:12:32.126 --> 00:12:33.544
Don't say it like that.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:36.964
Are you Yuji Itadori?

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.801
I'm Fushiguro from Jujutsu High.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.471
I have something to tell you now.

00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:45.973
Well, I'm in mourning.

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:47.766
Sorry, I don't have time.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.478
The cursed object on your hand
is very dangerous.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.062
Please give it to me right away.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:53.397
"The cursed object"?

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:55.024
This one.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:58.194
Oh, that one! I picked it up.

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:02.615
I don't care,
but my seniors are very interested.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:04.200
Why is that dangerous?

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.829
The number of unidentified deaths
and missing persons in Japan

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.915
exceeds 10,000 annually.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.335
<i>Most of them were caused by the "curse."</i>

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:16.587
"Curse"?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.132
Believe it or not, this is the truth.

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:21.634
I'll go on.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:26.263
<i>Resentment gathers easily
in schools and hospitals.</i>

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.099
<i>Pain, regret, shame…</i>

00:13:29.183 --> 00:13:32.645
<i>Humanity's negative emotions
are the source of the curse.</i>

00:13:32.728 --> 00:13:37.107
<i>That's why many schools
keep secret "exorcism" curses.</i>

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:39.610
<i>The one you got is also one of them.</i>

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.488
Since it's an exorcism,
isn't it a good thing?

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:43.739
Let me finish.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.826
<i>By keeping the evil cursed object,
one can keep away other curses.</i>

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.119
<i>It's highly poisonous.</i>

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.956
<i>Demon exorcism is nothing but a vice.</i>

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.626
<i>Its seal loosened year by year.</i>

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:59.463
<i>Now it's bait to invoke the curse
and make it grow.</i>

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:05.553
The one you've got is classified
as a "super hazardous material."

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.555
<i>Hand it over before someone dies.</i>

00:14:07.638 --> 00:14:11.767
I told you that I don't mind,
go and see my seniors.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:14.270 line:20%
It's empty.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:17.273 line:20%
All I'm tracking is the rubbish
attached to the box.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.526
Where's the thing inside?

00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:23.529
I told you, it's with my senior…

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.197
What happened?

00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:29.034
Yes, they said they were going to reveal
the symbol at school tonight.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:30.452
What?

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:33.789
Is something serious going on?

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.501
It's not just that.

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:40.462
They are going to die.

00:14:45.342 --> 00:14:47.052
I can't take it off.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:49.638
Do we really have
to sneak in here to do this?

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.140
Turn on the lights.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.350
No, don't ruin the mood.

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:56.395
Feeling stimulation is the essence
of the Occult Club.

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:58.731
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:01.525
I took it down.

00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.666
Human finger.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.460
A real finger?

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:24.840
This is…

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.637
What happened?

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.559
Was it easy to reveal the symbols?

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.646
A man without cursed energy can't do it.

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:40.731
Normally, it is.

00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.150
Move to the right.

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.444
The content is too strong this time.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.197
The seal is too old.
It's just an old paper now.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.284
But I still can't imagine
what you said about the curse.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.619
Where are they?

00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:54.870
Fourth floor.

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.085
What's with the pressure?

00:16:01.168 --> 00:16:02.544
You stay here.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.423
I'm coming too! It's dangerous, right?

00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.550
Even though I just met them,

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:11.136
they are my friends,
so I can't just leave it alone.

00:16:12.554 --> 00:16:13.764
Stay here.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.184 line:20%
OCCULT PHENOMENON RESEARCH CLUB

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:24.108
What time is it?

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:32.074
The hour hand points to 11…

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:34.159
<i>What's wrong with that monster?</i>

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.036
Sasaki.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.872
Iguchi, thank goodness!
Where have you been?

00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:42.251
Help me…

00:16:45.587 --> 00:16:48.173
What time is it?

00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:50.134
The curse has been activated.

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:52.302
The breath is still strong.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:57.433
Don't get in the way.

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.475
Divine Dogs!

00:17:05.816 --> 00:17:07.735
Go ahead and eat it.

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.322
<i>Can I just listen to him and wait here?</i>

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.743
<i>What am I afraid of?</i>

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:18.328
They are going to die.

00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:21.999
<i>Yes, the breath of death is approaching.</i>

00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:23.625
<i>I'm afraid of death.</i>

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:28.047
<i>Am I scared? I don't even feel it at all.</i>

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.175
<i>I cried not because I was scared,</i>

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.385
<i>but because I'm lonely.</i>

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:38.098
<i>Grandpa's death and the death
that might happen in front of me now.</i>

00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.184
<i>What's the difference?</i>

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:44.063
<i>You're strong enough to save others.</i>

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:53.572 line:20%
The number of curses has increased.
It's very close.

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.581
Found it.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.251
<i>He's bad-tempered and stubborn.</i>

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.254
<i>No one will come to see him except me.</i>

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.716
<i>He said, "Don't be like me."</i>

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:14.760
<i>He was right.</i>

00:18:14.843 --> 00:18:17.971
Are you trying to swallow
humans and cursed objects together?

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:20.933
It's too late.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:31.652
Itadori.

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:35.114
<i>I think Grandpa's death is correct.</i>

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.658
But…

00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:40.911
The death here…

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:45.082
It's incorrect!

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:51.421
Is that a curse?

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:53.173
It's different from what I thought.

00:18:58.095 --> 00:19:00.305
I was going to ask you why you're here.

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.765
But you did a good job.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.308
Why are you so self-important?

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:07.563
What are those creatures
eating the curse hungrily?

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.106
It's my Shikigami.

00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:10.399
Can you see it?

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.152
Normally, people can't see a curse.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:16.280
Only when you're on your deathbed
or in this particular situation.

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:18.115
Oh, really?

00:19:18.198 --> 00:19:20.826
I've never seen a ghost before.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.829
Aren't you scared?

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:26.456
I was really scared.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.793
But you know, humans will really die.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:30.794
What?

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:36.049
So I should at least let the person
I know get the right death.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.427
Well, I don't get it either.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.429
Oh, my. Is this it?

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:44.266
Yes. A Special Grade Curse,
the finger of Ryomen Sukuna.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:46.768
It's a miracle she didn't get eaten
together with it.

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.062
Why would it eat this? Is it delicious?

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:50.063
What nonsense.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.566
It is to level-up your curse power.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:54.568
It's dangerous, so give it to me.

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.153
Okay.

00:20:01.074 --> 00:20:02.409
Run!

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.419
Fushiguro!

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:14.880
Nue!

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.552
What?

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:39.696
I can't think anymore.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.993
Itadori, you should take them and run!

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.330
Aren't you in danger too?

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:56.213 line:20%
A curse can only be exterminated
by a curse, you can't defeat it.

00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:58.048
It's not the time to say such things!

00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:00.425
You'll die at this rate!

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:05.097
I would feel terrible if I left you now.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.348
And…

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.103 line:20%
There is a troublesome…

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:13.105
<i>Save others.</i>

00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:16.275 line:20%
…curse on me too.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:27.703
Stupid! Give it to me!

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.538
You'll be swallowed too.

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.003
<i>Why would it eat this? Is it delicious?</i>

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:37.421
<i>What nonsense.</i>

00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:39.506
<i>It is to level-up your curse power.</i>

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:45.554
Isn't that the way to save everyone?

00:21:45.637 --> 00:21:48.724
Can't I have a curse?

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:50.058 line:20%
Stop.

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:51.727
No!

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:56.440
<i>Ryomen Sukuna's finger
is a Special Grade Curse.</i>

00:21:56.523 --> 00:21:58.900
<i>It is a poisonous thing, so he'll die.</i>

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:03.405
<i>But what if…</i>

00:22:44.404 --> 00:22:48.742 line:20%
The moonlight is supposed to be felt!

00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:52.704 line:20%
<i>Oh, no! The worst possible
"what if" has happened.</i>

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.499
<i>The Special Grade Curse
is parasitic on him.</i>

00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:58.001
The flesh of the curse is too weak.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:01.088
Where are the humans and the women?

00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:04.674
This era is really nice.

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:08.345
Women and children walk around
like maggots.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.639
It's wonderful.

00:23:10.722 --> 00:23:12.724
We can go on killing.

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:15.769
What?

00:23:18.396 --> 00:23:20.357
What are you doing
with someone else's body?

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.483
Give it back!

00:23:21.566 --> 00:23:23.985 line:20%
Why are you moving?

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:26.530
This is my body.

00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:29.616
He's suppressing me.

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.827
Don't move!

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.537
You're not human anymore.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.454
What?

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:39.292 line:20%
According to the sorcery law,
Yuji Itadori,

00:23:39.876 --> 00:23:41.962
as a Cursed Spirit, you will be…

00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:44.047
exorcised!
