00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:09.676
He looked at my chest lewdly!

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.433
You have big breasts,
so it bounces when you run, Tsubasa.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.269
I understand how you feel, Yoshino.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.981
<i>Even if I had a button
that would kill someone I dislike,</i>

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.941
<i>I probably wouldn't press it.</i>

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.609 line:20%
-It's disgusting.
<i>-However…</i>

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.486
-Shut up.
<i>-If there's a button</i>

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.364
<i>to kill someone that didn't like me…</i>

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.412
<i>I'll press it without hesitation.</i>

00:00:38.038 --> 00:00:39.914
HUMAN CENTIPEDE 3

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.332
Excuse me.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.377
Excuse me.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.964
-Excuse me!
-What?

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.719
One adult ticket for <i>Human Centipede 3.</i>

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:54.804
The total is 1,800 yen.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.598
Here you go.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.521
The movie will be screening soon.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.736
<i>As a doctor, I've been working
to save people for many years.</i>

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.115
He actually had 50,000 yen,
even though he's just in middle school!

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.742
-So much?
<i>-This is the worst.</i>

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:17.994
What happened next?

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.039
<i>High school students shouldn't skip school
and come to the cinema.</i>

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:23.249
<i>-Even though I'm not one to say.</i>
-You're mean!

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.710
<i>I realized.</i>

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.339
<i>Seriously, it's so terrible.</i>

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.509
-It's your treat today.
<i>-I can't hear the lines at all.</i>

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.635
Are you joking?

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:37.472
<i>There are still people like them
with decent grades.</i>

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:39.641
So did you see it?

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.434
No.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:45.355
Are you saying Tsubasa's lying?

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.440
I'm sure he has seen it!

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:49.859
Unreasonable.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.736
There's a 50% off coupon.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.865
-Where is the place?
-Hey, hit him harder.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.784
<i>Darn that woman.</i>

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:01.746
<i>She's having fun using me
to confirm her status.</i>

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.165
I knew it. You're looking!

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.127 line:20%
<i>Darn it.</i>

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.756
<i>I'm going to say it.</i>

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.636
You're not as cute as you think, Tsubasa.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.348
The three of them know that too.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.393
The reason they flatter you…

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.312
is because you seem easy--

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.568
<i>-Let's create the perfect human.</i>
-No.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.570
He won't let us do it.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.905
-It's over.
<i>-Stop talking!</i>

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.408
<i>No! Stop!</i>

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.410
<i>No!</i>

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.162
It's Tsubasa.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.582
<i>-Turn off your phone!</i>
-Hello. What is it?

00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:57.135
Now? I'm free.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.511
You guys…

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.389
-Let me think.
-You have to be considerate.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.312
<i>Don't worry.</i>

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:09.397
<i>Everything went well.</i>

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.859

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.621
What's this?

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.048
<i>That guy just now.</i>

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.051
<i>No way. Can a human do such things?</i>

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:41.429
<i>Even if he can,</i>

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:42.847
<i>is he really…</i>

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:44.557

Are you going to scold me?

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.112
Are they important…

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.864
to you?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.369
<i>It's okay.</i>

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:06.204
You can eat it.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.497
This is too much.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.625
I feel bad for him. He's crying!

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:30.478
Will I be able to…

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.649
do the same thing you did?

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:07.366 line:20%

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:26.010
Why are they allowed to enter

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.304
On top of that, wasn't one of them a kid?

00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:30.848
I don't know the details either.

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.768
But you saw that too, didn't you?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.481
That's beyond
the scope of the human realm.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:44.153
Just turn a blind eye.

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.365
If you want to work
until you retire, that is.

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.035
Can you see?

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.329
These are cursed energy residuals.

00:06:54.664 --> 00:06:57.750
-I can't see it at all.
-It's because you aren't trying.

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:02.046
We usually confirm the curse visually.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.258
<i>If you use cursed techniques,
you'll leave traces.</i>

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:06.676
<i>They are called "residuals."</i>

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.679
<i>But residuals are harder to see
compared to Cursed Spirits.</i>

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.306
You have to look carefully.

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:17.061
Hey!

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.814
-I can see them!
-Of course.

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:23.484
You're considered a qualified sorcerer
if you can sense them before seeing them.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.824
You can be more encouraging, you know?

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:32.034
I don't praise or insult anyone.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.704
I observe the facts and judge by them.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.289
That is how I do things.

00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:40.293
I used to have the misconception
that society is the same.

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:42.253
But let's not talk about it.

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:44.172
We're chasing them.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.007
All right. Let's do our best!

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:48.968
No need. If we can do it casually,
then just do that.

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.095
Let's go.

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:54.640
<i>I feel like we can't get along.</i>

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.726
<i>He doesn't respond well to what I say.</i>

00:07:57.768 --> 00:07:59.854
<i>I can't take you there this time.</i>

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.148
But don't worry.

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.275
I've contacted a trustworthy junior.

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.363
This is Kento Nanami,
a Jujutsu Sorcerer who quit office work!

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:11.449
Please stop that.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.076
There are many strange Jujutsu Sorcerers,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.747
but he used to work in an office,
so he's reliable.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.707
And he's a Grade 1 Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.085
I don't think others want
to hear that from you.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.045
<i>Sunglasses.</i>

00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.506
<i>There are so many people
covering their eyes.</i>

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.299
Since you quit your job,

00:08:28.382 --> 00:08:31.511 line:20%
why didn't you become
a Jujutsu Sorcerer from the beginning?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.638
We should start
with self-introductions first.

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.556
Nice to meet you, Itadori.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.892
Yes, nice to meet you.

00:08:37.975 --> 00:08:41.020
When I was studying in the university,
I realized that…

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.898
Jujutsu Sorcerers are shit.

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.982
<i>What?</i>

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.278
When I was working in a normal company,
I realized that…

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.697
office work is shit too.

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:52.782
Is that so?

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.118
Since both are shit, I chose the one
that I have more aptitude for.

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.746
That's why I'm back.

00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:00.164
He's dark.

00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.415
Yes.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.750
Itadori.

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:06.587
Please don't think that
I have the same thinking as Gojo.

00:09:06.671 --> 00:09:09.924
I trust him and have confidence in him…

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.470
but I don't respect him!

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.555
What?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.723
I hate the way
the higher-ups do their job,

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:20.268
but I adhere to rules strictly.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.353
I've talked too much.

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:23.271
In any case,

00:09:23.354 --> 00:09:26.774
I do not acknowledge you
as a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:09:26.857 --> 00:09:29.360
While you have the bomb that is Sukuna,

00:09:29.443 --> 00:09:33.781
please do your best to prove to me
that you're a useful person.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:39.161
<i>I'm weak and useless.</i>

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:42.331
<i>I was made to realize that recently.</i>

00:09:44.458 --> 00:09:46.294
But I'll get stronger.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.922
If I'm not strong enough,
I can't even choose my own way of death.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.261
You don't have to say that.
I'll make you acknowledge me.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:57.305
Please wait a little longer.

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.351
No, don't tell me.
Tell that to the higher-ups.

00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:05.479
-Okay.
-To be frank, I don't care!

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:06.772
I get it already!

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.653
The surveillance camera
didn't capture anything, right?

00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:16.824
Yes. Other than the victim,
there was another teenager.

00:10:16.907 --> 00:10:18.909
Is the culprit a Cursed Spirit?

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.579
Well…

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:26.834
That teenager has a motive to do so too,

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.503
but the police should be the one
to investigate him.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:30.546
What?

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:37.053
Lunch box.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.057
I'll take care of this.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.184
You take care of the other one, Itadori.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:49.315
Nice detergent.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:52.151
Once you ascertain that
you can't defeat it, let me know.

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.820
You're totally looking down on me.

00:10:54.904 --> 00:10:57.490
I'm not looking down on you.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:00.910
I'm an adult, you're still a kid.

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:05.873
I'm obligated to protect you.

00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:09.669
I would rather be looked down on
than be treated like a kid!

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:12.463
You've gone through
many near-death experiences,

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:15.591
but that doesn't make you an adult.

00:11:15.674 --> 00:11:18.344
Having a more severe hair fall

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:22.765
or your favorite sandwich missing
from the convenience store…

00:11:22.848 --> 00:11:26.602
Accumulating these
minor disappointments in life…

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.313
makes people mature into adults.

MONDAY, 11:15 A.M.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.032
My cursed technique allows me to

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.869
create weak points on enemies,
no matter who they are.

00:11:44.453 --> 00:11:45.746
Seven to three.

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.332
<i>If you divide the length of the opponent</i>

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:53.295
<i>and strike the specific point,
it will be a critical hit.</i>

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:55.423
Even if the opponent's stronger than me,

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.551
I can still deal
considerable damage to them.

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.722
If the opponent's weak, I can even
bisect them with this blunt knife.

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.309
Are you listening, Itadori?

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.812 line:20%
Were you talking to me?

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:16.694
Oh, god.

00:12:16.777 --> 00:12:19.697
Is it all right to reveal your technique?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.074
There's no harm in
revealing this cursed technique,

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.118
and it's fine to reveal this technique

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.578
to an enemy of this level…

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.623 line:20%
<i>I want to focus on fighting,
but I think I need to listen to him.</i>

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:31.792 line:20%
It has its benefits, too.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:33.919 line:20%
The binding vow of showing one's cards

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:36.505 line:20%
can increase the effectiveness
of the cursed technique.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.299 line:20%
Like this.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.724
Lunch box.

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.785
That's all from me.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.413
Awesome.

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:12.917
The knife was wrapped up
in multiple layers,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.045
and he even slashed it
with the back of the knife.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:19.215
Behind you, Itadori.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:20.633
What?

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.723
It's not good to be distracted.

00:13:27.806 --> 00:13:29.934
Who's the one talking to me?

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:34.438
Laundry detergent!

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.452 line:20%
<i>Your cursed energy has a time lag.</i>

00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:50.162
It hurts.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:51.455
Time lag?

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.084
Your cursed energy can't keep up
with your instant explosive power.

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:57.920
Your technique to stop cursed energy
is unrefined as well,

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.672
so it tends to leave traces.

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:03.384
As a result, this creates
an irregular flow of cursed energy,

00:14:03.926 --> 00:14:07.555
<i>and your cursed energy appears
after throwing out your punch.</i>

00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:12.184 line:20%
<i>So you can utilize that lag to make
one punch into a double-impacted strike.</i>

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.244
<i>Divergent Fist!</i>

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:32.746 line:20%
That sounds cool!

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.249
It's not something you can master easily.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.751
It will be a great weapon to you.

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:43.382
<i>Is his original power
far beyond ordinary people?</i>

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:45.759
<i>The initial blow
didn't contain much cursed energy,</i>

00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:49.597
<i>but it's 120% more powerful
than a normal Jujutsu Sorcerer.</i>

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.183 line:20%
<i>Following that,
he injects his real cursed energy.</i>

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:56.604 line:20%
<i>I bet his opponent must hate that.</i>

00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.440
<i>And there's still room for improvement.</i>

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.191
<i>If he can hit with his full strength</i>

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:04.528
<i>followed by all of his cursed energy…</i>

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:08.324
<i>No wonder that guy brought him here.</i>

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:11.076
Lunch box…

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.912
Sorry, I'll end you now.

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.461
Itadori, don't deliver the final blow yet.

00:15:22.171 --> 00:15:23.631
Look at this.

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:24.882
What?

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:27.343
I took a photo of my opponent.

00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:30.471
Cursed Spirits
can't be photographed, right?

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.140
Calm down and listen to me.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:37.019
Our opponents are…

00:15:39.229 --> 00:15:40.648
They are humans.

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:44.193
No, I guess I should say
they used to be humans.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.403
Just like the three people in the cinema.

00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:50.282
<i>Their bodies were transmogrified
with cursed energy.</i>

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:52.993
If that's the case,
I would have found out from the start.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:55.204
The two opponents we fought against

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.915
are full of cursed energy,
like Cursed Spirits.

00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:01.919
<i>You can only ask the culprit
what cursed technique he used.</i>

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:05.673
But there are traces of tampering
near the brain stem.

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:09.760
I think it's to create confusion
with consciousness disorder.

00:16:09.843 --> 00:16:12.054
<i>If they are capable
of modifying the brain,</i>

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:15.516
<i>they might be able to make them
use cursed energy as well.</i>

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.601
<i>After all, the relationship
between the brain</i>

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:19.603
<i>and cursed energy is still a mystery.</i>

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.773
<i>By the way, is Itadori listening?</i>

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.316
Yes.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:27.945
To put it simply, their cause of death

00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:30.781
was due to the shock
caused by the modification.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.158
You didn't kill them.

00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.703
<i>Make no mistake about this.</i>

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:37.538
Yes.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.164
SHOKO IEIRI

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.418
No matter what,

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:45.546
their deaths bear the same weight on me.

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.382
Even so…

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:51.510 line:20%
This is too distasteful.

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:56.974
<i>This kid can really get angry for others.</i>

00:16:58.308 --> 00:16:59.935
Those residuals are bait.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.688
It's probably to draw us out.

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.898
The opponent is really skilled.

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.526
I guess we can't wrap this up easily.

00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.820
Let's do our best.

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:13.532
Okay!

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:17.411 line:20%
<i>"Special Grade Imaginary Cursed Spirit."</i>

00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:20.039 line:20%
<i>There are some Cursed Spirits
labeled as such.</i>

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:24.626
<i>A Cursed Spirit is a collection
of cursed energy flowing out from humans.</i>

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.795
Even if they don't exist physically,

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:29.465
fearful common perceptions
that humans share

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:32.593 line:20%
make it easy to manifest
as a powerful curse.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:35.971
Fearful common perceptions
that humans share?

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.933
Are you referring to famous monsters
or ghost stories?

00:17:40.017 --> 00:17:44.730 line:20%
That's right. There are many of those,
like Ms. Hanako or the Nine-Tailed Fox.

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:48.484
Jujutsu Sorcerers classify them
as Special Grade Imaginary Cursed Spirits

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:50.611
and deal with them accordingly.

00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.572
The same goes
for unknown and powerful curses.

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:56.867
<i>They are usually categorized as such too.</i>

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.661
I guess that's all they see.

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:05.125
But what people usually fear
are not myths like this.

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:08.295
Are you referring to natural disasters?

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:12.800 line:20%
It's great that talking to you
doesn't give me stress.

00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:15.469
No, well…

00:18:23.602 --> 00:18:24.728
Humans…

00:18:26.772 --> 00:18:31.151 line:20%
They fear the earth,
the forest, and the ocean.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:36.490 line:20%
The cursed energy
flowing into them is too great.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:41.995
<i>Before they took form, they hid
out of sight as they gained knowledge.</i>

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.999
I'm proud that
every one of them is my comrade.

00:18:48.377 --> 00:18:51.880 line:20%
What kind of curse are you, Mahito?

00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:55.676
Human.

00:18:57.136 --> 00:19:03.767
I'm a curse born from the hate
people feel for one another.

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:07.938 line:20%
SHUUEI HIGH SCHOOL DETACHED OFFICE

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.524
<i>The recent disappearances
and bizarre deaths</i>

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:13.694 line:20%
have been consolidated
into residuals report by a window.

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:17.614
With this, we can pinpoint the culprit's
hideout within a certain range.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.533
Good! Are we going to barge in?

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:22.035
No, this is just an approximation.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:24.204
I'll continue the investigation.

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.540
I have another job for you, Itadori.

00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:31.044
This is Junpei Yoshino,
the teenager that was in the cinema.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:34.882
He went to the same school as the victims.

00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:39.052
Based on his behavior
from the surveillance video,

00:19:39.136 --> 00:19:43.348
he's unlikely to be a Curse User.

00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:48.270
However, the connection between him
and the victims is another matter.

00:19:48.353 --> 00:19:49.688
Curse User?

00:19:49.771 --> 00:19:52.316
The evil version of a Jujutsu Sorcerer.

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:55.027
I've left the protocols to Ijichi,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.905
so I would like the both of you
to investigate Junpei Yoshino.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.615
Roger!

00:19:59.698 --> 00:20:00.866
-Speaking of which…
-What?

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:03.702
I don't know any other assistants
aside from you, Mr. Ijichi.

00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:07.748
Well, I'm the only one
who knows you're still alive.

00:20:07.831 --> 00:20:09.333
It can't be helped.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:10.918
I see.

00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:13.420
Let's go!

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:21.470
I don't think it's just an approximation.
You already know, right?

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.013
The culprit's location, that is.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.681
Of course.

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:29.436
The culprit can leave the scene
without leaving residuals if he wants.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.773
We're being lured again.

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:38.153
There's the risk of going alone,
and the risk of bringing Itadori along.

00:20:38.237 --> 00:20:40.614
I chose the former, that's all.

00:20:40.697 --> 00:20:42.783
Since he's still a child.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:45.661
Mr. Nanami!

00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:47.579
Itadori?

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:48.747
I forgot to tell you.

00:20:49.414 --> 00:20:50.791
You must be careful.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:53.794
Itadori.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:57.589
<i>I'm not a teacher,
so don't address me like that.</i>

00:20:57.673 --> 00:20:59.716
<i>-Nanami then.
-I'll beat you up.</i>

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.305
<i>I found him.</i>

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:07.557
Wait, casual clothes?

00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:10.852
He hasn't been to school lately.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.022
FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS ONLY

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.651
We'll need to get out of the car here.

00:21:19.444 --> 00:21:20.529
Let's go.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.094
<i>-Juju Stroll!
-Juju Stroll!</i>

00:23:07.594 --> 00:23:10.013
Nanami, let's go out together.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.765
No, thanks.

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:14.976
Wait, I really have something
important to tell you.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.270
-That's incredible.
-I haven't said anything yet!

00:23:17.854 --> 00:23:19.272
Well…

00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.190
SATORU

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:28.532
What?

00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:30.283
TO NANAMI

00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:31.785
PENIS
