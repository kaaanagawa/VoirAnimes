00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:14.806
Itadori, why is his nose bleeding?

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.724
What?

00:00:15.807 --> 00:00:16.683
I punched him.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.185
-When?
-At the very start.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.187
Did he touch you with his hand?

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.188
Yes.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.192
My attacks have zero effect on him.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.111
What?

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.572
-Why?
-The reason will come during the lecture.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:34.576
<i>First, he may not be able
to use his ability on Itadori.</i>

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:38.121
<i>Second, he has a reason
not to kill Itadori.</i>

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.248
<i>Either way, it's an advantage.</i>

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.710
But I can stifle his movements.

00:00:45.378 --> 00:00:49.424
Let's create openings for each other
and take the opportunity to attack.

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.927
We must exorcise him here.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.306
Okay!

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.399
<i>Be mindful of Yuji Itadori…</i>

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.528
<i>and get rid of 7:3 Sorcerer first.</i>

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:34.093
<i>I thought this was good.</i>

00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.638
<i>But they evaded my attacks.</i>

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.016
<i>After they dodge it,
the tips of my needles will come off.</i>

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.851
<i>It's only good for small fries.</i>

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.311
<i>Let's stop this.</i>

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.157
Before he changes his shape…

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.493 line:20%
-He charges his cursed energy first!
-Very good.

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:02.413
<i>Even if I make myself smaller,</i>

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:05.708
<i>I still risk getting killed
by Yuji Itadori in one blow.</i>

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.086
<i>He's really my nemesis.</i>

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.630
<i>Let's make him behave nicely.</i>

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:14.175
<i>Transfigured humans.</i>

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.678
<i>He still has some stored.</i>

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:19.013
Kill that short-haired brat.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.482 line:20%
I knew it.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.609 line:20%
That kid can't kill humans.

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.960
Let's play…

00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:59.012
Please…

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.472
Kill me…

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:08.563
I want you to fight against him next.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.398
Will he cry this time?

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:14.360
He's a foolish brat
who can't match ideal with reality.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.362
That's not true.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.949
He's on it right now.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.868
If anything,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:23.620 line:20%
you're the foolish one.

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.961 line:20%
You killed them?

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.883
<i>His cursed energy level increased.</i>

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:39.719
<i>I'll change my shape
right before the impact--</i>

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.775
<i>There's no time for me
to make a substitute.</i>

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.110
<i>What…</i>

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.280
<i>What a fresh inspiration!</i>

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.032
<i>Is this…</i>

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.201
<i>death?</i>

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:12.835
<i>I can do it now, right?</i>

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.552
<i>Domain Expansion.</i>

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.821
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:42.699
Darn it.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.119
Now…

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.039 line:20%
I just want to thank you.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:27.637 line:20%
Are you serious?

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.809
<i>Why was only Nanamin trapped inside?</i>

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.352
<i>If this goes on…</i>

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:35.686
<i>If this goes on…</i>

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.068
<i>Domain Expansion.</i>

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.363
<i>An enclosed space constructed
using cursed energy.</i>

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:49.367 line:20%
<i>A secret weapon that will enhance
the owner's strengths.</i>

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:53.496 line:20%
<i>It's the pinnacle of cursed techniques
that I couldn't reach.</i>

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:58.292
<i>To use any cursed technique
which transfigures the soul,</i>

00:06:58.376 --> 00:07:01.754
<i>he probably needs to touch someone
with the palm of his original hand.</i>

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.049
<i>But now that I'm inside his domain…</i>

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:10.096
<i>I'm literally in the palm
of my opponent's hand.</i>

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.598
Darn it.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.143
<i>Jujutsu Sorcerers are shit.</i>

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.187
<i>Sometimes, we have to force our comrades</i>

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:21.107
<i>to accept and sacrifice
their lives for others.</i>

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.942
<i>That's why I quit.</i>

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.695
<i>Or rather, I escaped.</i>

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.615
Do you like baguette sandwiches?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.533
What?

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.160
What?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.288
You always buy this, right?

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.248
Well, yes.

00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:40.042
The nearby convenience store
no longer sells it.

00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:42.753
Our bread's better than those
in convenience stores, right?

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.256
I mean, this is a bakery.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:47.383
You're so mean.

00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.887
Please come again!

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:55.016
<i>A Fly Head.</i>

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:59.020
<i>I guess it's fine to leave it alone.</i>

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:01.772
<i>It will be trouble if I do a bad job</i>

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.649
<i>and she thinks I'm some shady medium.</i>

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.283
How is it going?

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:16.537
Giving us money
means giving us their lives.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.208
I don't need to talk much about
how to balance the benefits and risks.

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:23.878
No need to do anything special
at the beginning.

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.714
You just have to
face the clients sincerely.

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:28.674
Don't forget this.

00:08:28.758 --> 00:08:29.926
Yes!

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:31.928
Nanami.

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.555 line:20%
Don't make it sound so rigid.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.140 line:20%
You'll scare the newbie.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:40.603 line:20%
Newbie, your top priority
is the company's profit.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.439 line:20%
This will also be our clients' benefits.

00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:47.109 line:20%
Even persuading clients
to buy stocks that won't rise?

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:52.990
This is the legitimate reward for us
who watch the market 24 hours a day.

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:55.201
Isn't this your second year, Nanami?

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.870
You're clever. You should let loose.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:08:59.413
I have high expectations of you.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:01.791
<i>I'm a person</i>

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.834
<i>who does not have a concept of</i>

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.170
<i>what is worth doing,
and what is worth living for.</i>

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.632
<i>I'll just earn some money
until I'm 30 or 40 years old,</i>

00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:13.719
<i>then I'll enjoy an aimless life
in a country with low cost of living.</i>

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:16.430
<i>Four years after graduation,</i>

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.976
<i>I think about money all the time.</i>

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.186
<i>Curse or other human beings,</i>

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.564
<i>I can stay away from them if I have money.</i>

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:26.440
<i>Money.</i>

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.484
<i>Money.</i>

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:29.944
<i>Money.</i>

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:32.863
<i>Money.</i>

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.157
<i>As long as I have money.</i>

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:37.785
Are you okay?

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:39.829
Have you been sleeping well?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.750
What about you? You look tired.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:47.211
You can tell?

00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:50.673
I feel that my shoulders
are quite heavy recently.

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.883 line:20%
Besides, I don't sleep well too.

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:59.390
My job is to
let the rich entrust their money to me

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:02.643
and make them richer.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.395
Something like that.

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:07.940
To be honest,
no one will be sad even if I'm gone.

00:10:08.024 --> 00:10:11.485
But if the bakery is gone,
people who want to eat bread will be sad.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:16.240
But somehow, a job like mine
that's outside of such a human cycle

00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:19.869
gives me a better salary.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.913
It's quite strange when I think about it.

00:10:24.415 --> 00:10:27.084
-Are you showing off?
-No.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.505
I'm sorry.
It's quite hard for me to understand.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.092
Can you come forward a little?

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:36.719
What?

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.475
-What?
-How do you feel now?

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:44.518
What? Let me see.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:46.729
What? It feels light!

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:49.440
Go to the hospital if you still feel sick.

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:50.941
I'll get going now.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.361
Oh, my!

00:10:53.444 --> 00:10:55.321
Wait!

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:56.572
Wait!

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.907
Excuse me.

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.869
Thank you!

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.789
Please come again!

00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:08.042
<i>-"Thank you."</i>
-Strange. Did he not hear me?

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.502
Thank you!

00:11:09.585 --> 00:11:12.046
Please come again!

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:16.842
<i>I thought I had nothing to live for.</i>

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:17.760 line:20%
SATORU GOJO

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.638
Hello. It's Nanami.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.181
I would like to talk to you.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:23.766
Yes.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.935
I'll return to Jujutsu High tomorrow…

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:28.187
Why are you laughing?

00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:33.901
Idle Transfiguration.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.237
I thank you.

00:11:40.908 --> 00:11:42.493
No need.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:51.502
I've received enough gratitude.

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:54.255
I have no regrets.

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.521
<i>How did he enter?</i>

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.982
<i>I see.</i>

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:15.651
<i>The greater the barrier,</i>

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.070
<i>the weaker it is to external attacks.</i>

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.740
<i>Domain is only focused on closing.</i>

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.743
<i>In other words,
it's easy for an invasion to happen.</i>

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.956
<i>Because it brings no benefit
to the intruder.</i>

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.711
<i>Even more so for the Unlimited Void
and Self-Embodiment of Perfection,</i>

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:39.216
<i>whereby victory is confirmed
when the opponent is trapped inside.</i>

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:42.136
<i>However,</i>

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.680
<i>Itadori is an exception.</i>

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.892 line:20%
<i>There's something in him
that cannot be touched!</i>

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.565
<i>I told you.</i>

00:12:57.651 --> 00:12:59.820
No second chances.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.120
<i>Everyone on earth
and in heaven must listen to him.</i>

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:12.583
<i>He acts solely based on his mood.</i>

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.085
<i>It's either you die…</i>

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:17.588
<i>or I die.</i>

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:19.548
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

00:13:20.841 --> 00:13:22.885
<i>Except for that guy,</i>

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.805
<i>I couldn't care less.</i>

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.469
<i>What happened?</i>

00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:14.311
I'll kill you!

00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:18.023 line:20%
<i>Domain Expansion has used up
too much cursed energy.</i>

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:20.943
<i>It was my last resort.</i>

00:14:21.026 --> 00:14:22.319
<i>But that scoundrel, Sukuna…</i>

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.072
<i>But this is the critical moment!</i>

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:26.949
<i>Squeeze it out!</i>

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.659
<i>The last of my cursed energy!</i>

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:33.831
<i>The target is large.</i>

00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.709
<i>The flow of his cursed energy
is slowing down.</i>

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.460
<i>There will be no counterattack.</i>

00:14:39.044 --> 00:14:41.171
<i>I can definitely attack him.</i>

00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:42.923
<i>It's my last chance.</i>

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:47.553
<i>No need for tricks.</i>

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:54.727
<i>Divergent Fist!</i>

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.488
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.365
<i>I felt nothing.</i>

00:15:12.453 --> 00:15:15.956 line:20%
-Wait!
-It was fun.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:26.300
Ino, the target has
escaped into the sewers.

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:27.927
That's right.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.723
Please conduct a thorough search
of the direction southeast to my location.

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:34.683
You should be able to exorcise him.

00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.186
We're going after him too!

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:40.064
Itadori!

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:41.941
<i>Move, my body!</i>

00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:44.568
<i>Weren't you going to kill him?</i>

00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:49.406
<i>-I must crush him…</i>
-Itadori!

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.574
Itadori!

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:14.723
<i>That's the King of Curses,</i>

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:16.517
<i> Ryomen Sukuna.</i>

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:21.105
<i>His current cursed energy
is inferior to Jogo.</i>

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:22.731
<i>However,</i>

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:24.817
<i>his presence…</i>

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.236 line:20%
<i>His soul is on
a completely different level.</i>

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.738
<i>I'm certain now.</i>

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:31.865
<i>Even if we were wiped out,</i>

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.661
<i>the era of curses can begin
as long as Sukuna is resurrected.</i>

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:38.747
<i>But it's so troublesome.</i>

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:45.004
<i>I really want to kill Yuji Itadori now!</i>

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:51.844
I'm feeling so impatient!

00:16:51.927 --> 00:16:53.804
But forget it.

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:58.142
Unlike the body,
the soul can be killed many times.

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:03.147
How should I kill him next time?

00:17:07.192 --> 00:17:09.570
<i>Didn't I tell you to rest?</i>

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.197
Are you lecturing me?

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:16.994
No lecturing needed for my savior.

00:17:17.745 --> 00:17:18.704
Me?

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:23.000
Mahito's cursed techniques
can interfere with other people's souls.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.464
You made him touch Sukuna's soul
when you invaded his domain.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.924
Thanks to you, I'm saved.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:35.304
But I didn't switch.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.390
<i>Sukuna didn't come out.</i>

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.684
<i>Instead, Mahito went in.</i>

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.480
Then I wasn't the one who saved you.

00:17:44.563 --> 00:17:46.440
Sukuna did it on a whim.

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:50.694
Nanami, I killed humans today.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.198
People will die. It's inevitable.

00:17:54.281 --> 00:17:56.825
But I want their deaths
to be justified, at least.

00:17:57.367 --> 00:17:59.119
That was what I was thinking.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.664
That's why I only think about
not pulling the trigger.

00:18:03.373 --> 00:18:07.711
But now that I pulled the trigger myself,
I don't understand it anymore.

00:18:08.504 --> 00:18:10.255
What's the right way to die?

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:12.800
I don't know either.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.555
The good should die peacefully
and the bad should have a horrible death,

00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:21.850
but most people are neither good nor evil.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:26.396
I believe that all deaths
come to all people differently,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.067
and giving proper guidance
to all the souls is just tiring.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.069
I don't recommend you to do that.

00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:37.032
Even so, you'll still try to do it.

00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:40.327
Just be careful not to die.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.081
If you weren't there today,
I would've died.

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:47.793
People who rely on you
will start to appear…

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:52.339
since you're already
a Jujutsu Sorcerer, Itadori.

00:18:57.594 --> 00:19:00.681
Put it in the box when you're done.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.516
You don't need to write your names.

00:19:02.599 --> 00:19:04.226 line:20%
QUESTIONNAIRE ON BULLYING

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:28.625
So it's you who injured Yoshino, Ito.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.671
I don't want to be scolded by the one

00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:35.340
who's too afraid to do anything
at that time.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:38.719
He's quit school and moved away, right?

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.262
Can't we forget about it?

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:42.347
By the way,

00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.601
my left hand can't move since then.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:48.395
I'm asking about your crime.

00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:51.607
Think of that injury
as your punishment and reflect on it.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.358
What about your punishment?

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.402
It's coming.

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:58.822
I want to take a good look
at the things I didn't see clearly.

00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:02.367 line:20%
Whether it's me or you…

00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:06.955
<i>We'll carry the sin
of ruining Junpei's heart forever.</i>

00:20:07.456 --> 00:20:10.375
I'll be watching you, Ito.

00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:18.800
<i>I still don't know
the meaning of a justified death.</i>

00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:20.469
<i>Then at least…</i>

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.305
<i>Before I understand…</i>

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:29.228
<i>Before I kill that guy…</i>

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.782
<i>I will never…</i>

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:45.535
<i>lose again.</i>

00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:17.919
<i>Juju Stroll.</i>

00:22:22.466 --> 00:22:23.884
Can we eat now?

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:24.968
Salmon.

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.852
This meatball is delicious.

00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:34.811
Who made it?

00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.563
It's me.

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:38.231
You can make it easily.

00:22:38.315 --> 00:22:41.651 line:20%
1. PUT IN ALL THE INGREDIENTS
AND USE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF GINGER

00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:44.946 line:20%
2. MIX AND KNEAD WELL

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:49.618 line:20%
3. SHAPE MEATBALLS WITH A SPOON
AND PLACE THEM INTO THE POT

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.496
INGREDIENTS: CHICKEN MEAT,
MINCED SPRING ONIONS, GINGER SAUCE

00:22:52.579 --> 00:22:54.998
EGG YOLKS (YOU CAN INCLUDE EGG WHITES)
SALT AND PEPPER

00:22:55.582 --> 00:22:56.750
Leaf mustard.

00:22:57.751 --> 00:23:00.170 line:20%
So Fushiguro can cook.

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:01.379
I'm not surprised.

00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:05.008
No, Itadori taught me how to make it.

00:23:15.143 --> 00:23:16.686
I see.

00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:20.816
Itadori's posthumous work.

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:22.526
That doesn't sound right.

00:23:25.487 --> 00:23:27.614
This meatball is so delicious.

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:28.657
They are.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.408
You can make it really easily.

00:23:32.327 --> 00:23:35.413
Fushiguro can make it too
since I taught him.

00:23:38.625 --> 00:23:41.294
<i>I want to see them soon.</i>
