00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.410
What? It isn't time
to take you for a walk yet!

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.780
Snow?

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.670
It would've been nice if it had stuck.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.920
Definitely no winter wonderland.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.970
It's too bad! I wanted to play in the snow!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.300
In that case...

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.680
Manager?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.930
Why don't we go to a place
where we can play in the snow?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.940
I LOVE YOU!

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.160
It's freezing!

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.040
Snow!

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.000
Yahoo!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880
Kaho-san sure is excited.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.590
Young girls are full of energy.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.670
Stupid brats, too.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.470
Make one with me, Maika-chan!

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:24.970
Um...

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.480
Idiot! What do you think
you're doing?

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.390
This shows the difference
between adults and teenagers.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.940
Got a problem with that?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.730
No.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.860
You ruined it.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.360
That's enough snowmen.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.070
Wait, did you make them
with your bare hands?

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.030
I forgot my gloves.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.660
But my hands are already numb,
so the cold doesn't bother me.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.870
You are really dumb, right?

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.790
Give me your hands then.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.540
Mafuyu-san, your hands are so warm!

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.250
Don't snuggle here.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.010
I love how warm a child's body is.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.180
If you're not careful, she'll use that
for one of her ero doujins.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
Akizuki-san, you read my mind.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.230
Then I get to make my doujin debut?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.350
How are you going to use me in the story?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.310
Will it be a story where the pigs
make me breathe heavily?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.650
You're kind of a scumbag.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.650
The thing that would be fitting
for you, Hideri-chan...

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.660
is a bellypunching fetish.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.530
DASH

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.990
Hideri-chan!

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.040
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.550
Kaho-san!

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.710
Where's everyone?

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.380
I'm the first one here.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.220
Those braids look adorable
on you, Maika-chan!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.100
I love your hair, too, Kaho-san!

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.520
So we can choose
between snowboarding and skiing?

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.860
Akizuki-kun...

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.730
Have you two decided
which you're going to do?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.990
No. Actually, I can't make up my mind.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.240
Boarding is more the 
normie thing to do, right?

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.950
Just now, I saw a really good snowboarder,
and it was breathtaking!

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.250
So I guess maybe snowboarding?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.040
Who's that?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.000
He's approaching us.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.260
That's the board I saw before!

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.680
Manager!

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.060
Aren't you guys going to do it?
It feels great!

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.060
There was a time lag
before I realized it was the manager!

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.060
Shit, me, too!

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.480
What kind of reaction is that?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.400
Snowboarding is cool,
although I'm a beginner.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.910
I wish I could do it like you, Manager!

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.280
Gotcha!

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.120
I'll be your patient teacher, Maika-san!

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.540
Really?

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.080
Thank you!

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.710
Not at all! It'll be fun!

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.420
That's not fair! Manager, teach us, too!

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.460
Sure. You can tag along. Later.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.050
So harsh.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.300
Huh? Miu...

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.890
Mafuyu-san!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.720
Aren't you going to snowboard?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.890
No.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.690
I'm going to stay here
and gaze at the slope.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.690
I enjoy people-watching!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.490
There are so many situations
I can probably use for my stories.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.950
I don't even want to imagine
how they would be used.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.620
There you go! You're doing well!

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.580
When you stop,
you want to fall on your butt.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.330
Snowboarding plus foreigner...

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.330
Okay!

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.960
equals unconditional coolness.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.710
Even though he's usually an incompetent otaku.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.460
Akizuki-kun...

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.260
Is that short snowboarding female...

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.760
Mafuyu-san?

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.850
Why our otakus are too talented?!

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.600
Wow!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.520
Ma-Mafuyu-san! 
Teach me how to snowboard!

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.940
Me, too! Please!

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.990
You're really good, too, Mafuyu-san!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.740
I-I'm teaching you, so you'll soon
be able to snowboard like that, Maika-san!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.240
Really?

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.620
I'm looking forward to it!

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.370
Yes, of course—

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.080
Oh, it's true!

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.840
Ma-Maika-san! Stop! Stop!

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.760
Ouch!

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.680
<i>I'm Hideri-chan, the swooping
klutzy angel of the ski slope!</i>

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.140
<i>Hot guys, this is your cue
to extend a hand!</i>

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.020
Are you okay, cutie?

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.100
Maika-san! I'll stop you!

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.400
Manager!

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.450
Sorry! Are you okay?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.490
I'm fine.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.080
You're not fine!

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.440
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.460
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.500
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.550
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.590
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.630
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.670
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.710
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.750
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:30.800
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.840
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.880
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.920
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.960
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.000
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.050
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.090
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.130
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.170
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.210
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.250
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.300
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.340
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.380
HAVE SOME SELF-RESPECT!

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.240
Women

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.240
Men

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.750
That was a lot of snowboarding!

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.380
And I gathered a lot tasty 
material for my stories.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.710
Why would that be your focus
when you come to a ski resort?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.590
I guess everyone enjoys things
in their own way.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.090
All right!

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.390
Maika-chan, can you snowboard now?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.350
Yes, the manager was a very good teacher!

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.980
From what I could see,
he was definitely a hands-on teacher.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.860
<i>The manager really took good care of me
all day today.</i>

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.530
<i>I'd like to give him something
to thank him!</i>

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.660
Seriously?

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.410
You're gonna confess your love?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.870
Lower your voice, Akizuki-san!

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.960
Let go of me!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.380
Jeez. So that's what you're so hyped about!

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.880
I am not hyped! How am I hyped?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.840
A confession of love, huh?

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.890
While on a trip and even better,
a ski slope...

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.140
A confession of love...

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.720
Seems like you set this whole plan up
just for that!

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.230
She might get turned off if she found out.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.270
Wouldn't it be better to wait
for a more natural moment?

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.780
I don't want to be scolded by a boy with
a towel wrapped around non-existent breasts!

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.200
That was refreshing.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.410
Manager!

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.660
Ma-Maika-san!

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.370
Did you get warmed up?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.700
Y-Yes.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.580
Um, do you have a few minutes?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.290
Sure.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.300
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.300
<i>Don't tell me
Maika-san's going to make the first move!</i>

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.170
You don't want to talk?

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.890
No, that's not it!
I have all the time in the world!

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.770
Have some coffee.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.850
Th-Thank you.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.100
That's my apology for teaching me.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.980
Apology?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.400
You couldn't snowboard much

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.490
because you were with me all day.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.120
This is all I can do at the moment,
but I'll thank you properly later.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.990
Please don't let that bother you!

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.790
I'm glad I was able to be
with you all day, Maika-san!

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.540
I mean, I was lucky you were a beginner!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.170
L-Lucky?

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.880
Ping pong! Ping pong!

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.630
There they are!

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.760
How about playing some ping pong
with cute li'l ol' me—

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.640
Be quiet.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:44.640
Anyway, snowboarding sure is fun.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.430
It sure is!

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.390
It's a little cold if you go fast,
but the wind feels good!

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.150
Even though you taught me,
I kept falling down!

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.950
But the snow was softer
than I thought it would be.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.900
<i>Maika-san in a yukata, just after a bath...</i>

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.660
<i>Gotta keep the blood in my nose!
Stay in there!</i>

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.540
I haven't gotten this much exercise
in a while either,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.670
so between that and being excited,
I'm a little...

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.800
We've got time tomorrow, too,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.550
so I'll teach you again—

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.420
SPURT

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.510
Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma-Maika-san!

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.930
Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma-Ma...

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.390
Ma-Ma-Ma-Maika-san...

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.390
Manager...

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.940
Previously...

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.980
Stile staff went on a ski trip.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.230
As they all enjoyed themselves,

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.200
the manager resolved to declare
his love for Maika! Whoa!

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.330
But right after a bath, Maika had a talk
with the manager, and things got crazy!

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.960
Is Maika actually
going to declare her love first?

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.170
What'll happen in the end?

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.080
Did we really need a summary?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:57.590
It's important.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.340
D-D-D-D-D-Don't tell me
Maika-san means to...

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.550
<i>No!</i>

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.680
<i>The man has to confess his feelings!</i>

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.350
Ma-Maika-san, please listen!

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.440
Maika-san, I... actually...

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.270
I love y-y...

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.860
Um...

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.610
I love that you might have
an aptitude for skiing, too!

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.610
He is really incompetent!

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:25.740
No, not that!

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.240
Um, listen, Maika-san...

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.330
I've always l-l...

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.250
Go, Manager! Conquer your weakness​!

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:35.290
...loved you!

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.580
Maika-san...

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.830
I love you!

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.470
Ma-Maika-san?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.100
Sh-She's sleeping!

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.180
Don't tell me she fell asleep?

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.100
That guy has the worst timing.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.030
It looks like he's so shocked
that he can't accept reality.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.570
No, I think...

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.450
A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A     A    A     A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A    A      A      A

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.450
...he's agonizing
over his lap being used as a pillow.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.120
<i>This is no time to be agonizing
over a lap pillow!</i>

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.660
Maika-san, please wake up.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.750
If you're going to sleep,
you should do it in your room.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.130
She's deep asleep.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.630
<i>She's exhausted
after I made her practice all day.</i>

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:26.880
All right.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.680
Guess I'll carry her to her room.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.350
Crap!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.180
Get back, get back!

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.690
Please open the door.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.070
Maika-san fell asleep
so I brought her back here.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.700
Huh?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.200
What's wrong? 
You're out of breath.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.910
We were doing a little exercising.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.200
That's right!

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.620
Anyway, Maika-chan fell down on you, huh?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:58.870
Kaho!

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.380
Ouch! What was that for?

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.010
Hu                                       MPH

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.470
It's terrible to eavesdrop
on a confession of love!

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.720
Don't pout like that. Our bad.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.390
Remember,
we're all rooting for you.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.770
We have a lot of time here today, too,
so look for your chance and go for it!

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.280
Forget it.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.030
I'm not gonna tell her how I feel.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.950
You don't have to go that far!

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.120
It's not that.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.000
Not being able to confess my love
even under these conditions

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:44.040
is God's way of telling me
that I shouldn't do it right now.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.550
Manager...

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.300
I'll look for my next opportunity.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.600
You're blaming God for bad timing?

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.930
Shouldn't you console me a little more?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.690
Maika-chan, Maika-chan!

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.560
What's wrong? 
Your face is red.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.270
Really?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.440
Maika...

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.730
Come here.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.950
Doesn't feel like you have a fever.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.870
Actually, I had an embarrassing dream,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.120
and that may be why I'm blushing.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.620
An embarrassing dream?

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.380
What was it? What kinda dream?

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880
U-Um... It was...

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.000
embarrassing...

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.090
or maybe lewd...

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:31.630
Lewd?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.760
A prim and proper girl with traditional
good looks has a l-l-lewd dream?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.220
That's so hot!

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.310
I doubt her idea of a lewd dream
matches up with what you have in mind.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.310
So? So? What kinda dream?

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.690
I-I'm really self-conscious about it,
s-so please don't laugh.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.940
Yep, yep!

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.240
I-In my dream,

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.950
the manager told me he l-loved me.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.200
<i>Th-That's reality!</i>

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.950
REALITY

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.460
So in your dream,
did you answer him, Maika-chan?

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.960
Y-Yes. I did.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.250
I said, "I love you, too."

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.760
You, too, Kaho-san.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.470
And Mafuyu-san, Miu-san, 
Hideri-chan and Akizuki-san...

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.260
I love all of you. 
That was my answer.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.770
Oh...

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.650
I feel sorry for him, but it sounds
like the manager doesn't have a chance.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.280
I'm not sure about that.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.420
Okay, try to snowboard today,
using what I taught you yesterday.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:46.960
Okay.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.790
Ma-Maika-san?

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:50.750
Um...

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.050
Wh-What?

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.550
<i>Maika-san has a weird attitude!</i>

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.510
<i>Did I make her practice too much
yesterday after all?</i>

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.100
I'm sorry!

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.100
Maika-san, you're just so kind
that I got carried away.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.140
I'm sorry for being so inconsiderate!

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.730
Th-That's not true—

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.860
Please don't hate me!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.860
It's okay, Manager—

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.360
Please don't hate me!

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.360
No! I don't want you to hate me!

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.080
<i>I was so bothered by that dream
that it put me in a bad mood,</i>

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.910
<i>which is making the manager sad!</i>

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.250
<i>When he's going out of his way
to teach me...</i>

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.130
<i>I have to</i>

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.630
<i>clear up the misunderstanding!</i>

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.710
Why? Why am I like this?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.840
It's okay, Manager!

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.550
Manager...

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.720
I love you!

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.060
I'm sorry!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.810
Why are you apologizing?

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.810
I'm sorry!

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.580
Thank you for coming on Christmas,
two lonely guys!

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.540
We really had a sadistic whip
cracked on us this year!

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.620
Yeah, it's been awesome!

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.380
Please don't come back here ever again.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.460
Good work, everyone!

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.050
I'm calling it a year.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.510
Why don't we all finish the leftover cake?

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.260
Yay!

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:25.970
Owner!

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.020
He brought you down?

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.900
Good for you!

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.320
Hey!

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.480
If you have enough time to be jealous
of a dog, help me instead.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.990
That's cute!

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.990
He called it a "leftover,"

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.370
but I bet he really made it for this!

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.290
That's our manager!

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.950
We see right through you!

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.370
Here you go, Kaho-san.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.880
This time I did it
without being nervous at all!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.010
Actually, I haven't finished
my latest manuscript yet.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.390
OWNER

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.510
The café really has gotten lively
this year, huh?

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:07.720
Yeah.

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:12.150
At first it was just the manager,
Akizuki-kun and me.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.020
You two were the opening staff?

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.900
I thought that would've included
the loli-granny...

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.620
I came after them.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:24.950
Yeah.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.080
This brings back memories.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.700
Back when those two just started...

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.130
<i>N-Nice to meet you.</i>

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.250
<i>Same here.</i>

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.130
Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:47.510
THUMP THUMP

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.090
<i>Yikes!</i>

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:46.300
<i>Actually, I've only spoken to males my age
in class while collecting the handouts!</i>

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.510
<i>Am I gonna be okay?</i>

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.100
THUMP THUMP

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.770
Crap! How do you talk to a real girl again?</i>

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.150
<i>The only females I've spoken to in two years
are convenience store clerks!</i>

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:56.610
Hello.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.700
You two were such innocents back then.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:02.780
Shut up!

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:03.740
After all...

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.740
I can't imagine that.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.490
I never change,
not even when I first meet someone.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.250
They didn't speak frankly like they do now,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:17.420
and whenever I was out on an errand,
I take it they didn't talk at all.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.340
Without me around, they'd never talk!

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.340
They're like completely different people now.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.640
Who are you to talk, you coward?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.010
Shut up! Shut your mouth!

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.640
Violence never solves anything!

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.310
The manager never has known
when to stop.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.400
Mafuyu-san, you were
the next one hired, right?

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.560
Yes.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.320
Scouting Mafuyu-san was really tough.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.610
<i>Excuse me, could I speak to you?</i>

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.490
<i>Actually...</i>

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:47.660
<i>Um...</i>

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.160
<i>Wait! Wh-Why? Why?</i>

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.410
BUZZ                  BUZZ

<i>The police! Call the police!</i>

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.420
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.750
I was... I was so scared!

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.800
Sorry. I just pegged you
as a pesty lolicon.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.550
And I was right.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.550
You're just as cruel now!
I'm not a lolicon!

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.020
But I'm surprised he succeeded
with you in the end, Mafuyu-san.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.310
How did you do it?

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.940
It was mainly a feat of strength.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.400
<i>We have a new friend!</i>

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.610
Then it was a crime!

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.370
That was a lovely episode!

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.950
Now that I remember it...
It's still frustrating.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.500
I had a lot of trouble with Mafuyu-san,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.920
which made it nice to get okays
from the rest of you after that.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.380
No, you were pretty heavy-handed
with Sakuranomiya, too.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.260
M-Maika-san, that's not true, is it?

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.220
Um... Right.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.390
<i>I love you!</i>

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.100
It was all very sudden,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.520
so I was a little surprised at first.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.770
I'm sorry.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.150
But...

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.900
if you hadn't called out to me
like that, Manager,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.410
I wouldn't be working here now.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.660
Besides, I'm the one
who made the decision to join!

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.790
Maika-san...

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.500
Kaho-san...

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.330
Mafuyu-san...

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.420
Miu-san...

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.550
Hideri-chan...

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.670
Yay!

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.920
Akizuki-san and Owner...

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.430
And Manager...

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:33.810
You're wonderful people,

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.430
and I've made many great memories here!

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.810
I love you all!

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.400
Hello!

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.400
Welcome to Stile!

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.150
Why did you come?

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.990
TSUDANUMA

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.540
Sorry—

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.040
Manager!

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.420
Maika-san!

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.420
<i>Huh? I have a feeling...</i>

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.960
<i>...this has happened before.</i>

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.340
Shall we go?

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.550
Yes!

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.930
HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN
SOMETIME, SOMEWHERE.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.930
Hope to see you again sometime, somewhere!

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:49.730
