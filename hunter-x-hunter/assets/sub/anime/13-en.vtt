00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.260
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.980
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.530
Letter x From x Gon

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.450
"Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.290
I'm doing fine.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.960
I just passed the Hunter
Exam's Third Phase.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.230
Isn't that great?

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.010
But it's been a tough ride.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.210
First, after leaving the island,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.050
the boat I was on ran into a big storm.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.860
But that's where I met
Leorio and Kurapika."

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.570
You can't buy class with money, Leorio.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.660
That's three times now.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.970
Step outside.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.110
I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline,
here and now.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.800
Take that back, Leorio!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.680
Take that back!

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.050
That's Leorio-san to you.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.050
Take back what you said!

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.150
Take back your words,
and I'll forgive you, Leorio.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.670
How many times must I repeat myself?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.490
You should show me some respect.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.780
I won't back down.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.410
Then I have no choice...

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.010
Damn it!

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.560
Thanks, Gon!

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.940
You saved my life.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.290
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.950
These two helped save you.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.730
Huh?

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.180
Thank you very much!

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.080
No, you don't need to thank me.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.200
Well...

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.080
Yeah, I'm glad you're okay.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.340
Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.090
What?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.760
I apologize for my rude behavior.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.100
Sorry, Leorio-san.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.240
Wh-What's with the sudden change?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.330
We sound like strangers...

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.110
Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.580
I'm also sorry.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.470
I take back everything I said.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.360
I was wrong.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.790
"This led to the three of us traveling to

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.440
the Hunter Exam site together.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.500
But the journey wasn't so simple."

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.470
Exciting two-choice quiz!

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.020
Here is your question...

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.030
Your son and daughter have
been kidnapped.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.800
You can only rescue one.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.960
Select 1 for your son,
or 2 for your daughter.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.190
Which will you rescue?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.240
<i>She's making fun of us...</i>

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.060
Don't stop me, Kurapika!

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.750
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.230
Calm down, Leorio!

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.820
How am I supposed to calm down?

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.550
You'll waste our correct response!

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.310
Correct response?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.940
We gave the right answer.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.060
Silence was the correct response.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.560
Please...

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.110
Please save my wife...

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.360
Leorio, we'll leave the
injured man to you!

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.080
Kurapika!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.840
Who are you?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.590
How can you tell that I'm
not the same one?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.800
Huh?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.850
Your face is completely different.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.000
And your voice is a little
higher and thinner.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.160
What?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.610
Did I say something funny?

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.120
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.870
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.120
You pass.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.130
"Finally, the Hunter Exam began!"

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.000
I apologize for the wait.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.150
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.650
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.110
You must follow me to Phase Two.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.420
This is the exam's First Phase.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.850
"That's when I made friends

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.180
with a boy around my age,
named Killua."

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.280
Hey, how old are you?

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.180
I'm twelve years old.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.650
Hmm...

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.180
<i>We're the same age.</i>

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.180
Huh?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.060
Guess I'll run, too.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.940
Wow!

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.280
That was cool!

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.400
I'm Killua.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.900
I'm Gon.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.450
Hey, why do you want to
become a Hunter?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.170
Me?

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.210
I'm not really interested in
becoming a Hunter.

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.710
Huh?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.870
I heard the exam was supposed
to be really hard,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.020
so I thought it'd be fun.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.210
But this is disappointing.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.680
What about you?

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.010
Well, my dad's a Hunter.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.590
So I want to become a Hunter,
like my dad.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.690
Hmm...

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.330
What kind of Hunter is he?

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.500
I don't know.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.290
That's kinda weird.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.200
Really?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.020
You want to be like your dad,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.690
but you don't know anything about him?

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.360
I was raised by Mito-san,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.800
so I've only seen my dad in pictures.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.720
Who's Mito-san?

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.700
Aunt Mito.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.140
Oh...

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.830
When he was twelve,
my dad took the Hunter Exam.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.840
He passed and became a Hunter.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.710
Then he left the island.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.970
I want to find out why he
chose to be a Hunter

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.720
over being with me.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.210
The exit!

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.470
Whew...

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.190
Goal!

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.420
Yay! I win!

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.530
What are you talking about?

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.910
I was faster...

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.940
Now, I'll go over the rules of the game.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.190
If you can take this ball from me,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.460
before the airship reaches
its destination, you win.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.940
It's mine!

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.910
I commend you on your efforts.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.790
"Thanks to Killua,

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.110
the Hunter Exam's been a lot of fun.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.960
We're best friends now."

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:05.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.140
Letter

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.900
"Applicants come from around the world
to take the Hunter Exam,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.370
so there are lots of amazing people."

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.670
Not bad, little boy.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.340
Is that a fishing pole?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.920
What a fascinating weapon.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.180
Allow me a closer look.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.210
Your fight is with

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.270
me!

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.530
You came to rescue your friend?

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.740
Such a good boy.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.370
And that expression...

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.120
Very nice.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.420
I'm getting excited now...

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.100
How wonderful...

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.370
I really do love that look.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.160
Do not fear.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.540
I will not kill your friend.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.050
He passed.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.930
Yes, you pass, as well.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.810
Grow up and become a fine Hunter.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.320
But I was pretty excited, as well.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.850
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.570
But I couldn't.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.200
And at the same time, I was excited.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.580
Isn't that strange?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.060
"At the start of the Hunter Exam,
there were 404 applicants.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.090
But by the time we reached
the Third Phase,

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.520
only 41 were left."

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.840
Ahem...

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.600
Everyone, the exam's Third Phase
will begin here,

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.200
at the top of Trick Tower.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.850
Trick Tower?

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.600
To pass this phase,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.150
you must reach the tower's base alive.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.680
The time limit is seventy-two hours.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.780
Wh-What is this place?

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.790
Look over there.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.960
Allow me to explain, gentlemen.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:24.220
Before you are some of
Trick Tower's prisoners.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.410
The Hunter Exam Committee

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.990
has also officially hired them
as examiners.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.010
You will be fighting against
the five of them.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.910
There's too much at stake
without knowing

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.750
what they have up their sleeves.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240
Given that, I shall...

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.740
No, I'll go!

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.450
Tonpa-san?

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.370
Let the fight begin!

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.460
I...

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.960
I give!

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.850
Huh?

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.000
What?

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.830
Did he just give up?

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.340
M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.860
We each light a candle
at the same time.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.030
The one whose candle goes
out first is the loser.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.660
Hey! Look at Gon's candle!

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.830
The flame suddenly became stronger!

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.050
He must have hidden gunpowder or some other
highly flammable substance inside,

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.300
to make the candle burn faster!

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.050
If the fire is stronger,

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.180
then a little breeze won't extinguish it.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:56.730
He's fast!

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.230
I win!

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.750
A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.040
That's...

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.390
I'm Majitani, one of the
Phantom Troupe's four kings!

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.050
Consider that first strike
my way of saying hello.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.610
This is your last chance to surrender.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.010
I'm still willing to...

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.470
Huh?

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:47.030
Wh-What's wrong with you?

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.950
<i>Huh?</i>

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.370
<i>Wh-What?</i>

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.720
Right! In that case, we'll use
rock-paper-scissors!

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.720
A bet on who'll win a game
of rock-paper-scissors!

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.390
What?

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.220
It's so obvious what you'll use.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.980
I can read minds.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.690
Liar!

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.300
Your bluffing won't scare me!

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.990
You'll believe me soon enough.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.990
Let's do this!

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:40.160
Rock...

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.160
Paper...

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.750
Scissors!

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.080
Well? What will you use next?

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.170
Think hard.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:52.990
Come on.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.290
Damn!

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.770
Man, I have no idea what to think!

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.020
Here we go!

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.020
Here...

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:03.770
comes the...

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.020
draw!

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.940
I win!

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:18.220
How are we settling this contest?

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.500
Contest?

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.450
I believe you're confused.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:26.320
This will be a one-sided massacre.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.960
I have no interest in the exam
or any offer of amnesty.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.470
I just want to hear you scream.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.620
Really? Okay.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.510
Then the loser is the one who dies.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.540
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:48.080
I'll tear your body apart.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.150
That's...

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.390
mine.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.500
G-Give it back.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.700
Please select a path.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.200
There are two choices.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.150
One path allows five to pass,

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.840
but is long and difficult.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.650
The other path allows only three,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.740
but is short and easy.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.170
I'm going to press O.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.050
We made it all the way here together.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.510
I want us all to pass together.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.980
Gon...

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.250
Even if it's a big risk,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:02.260
I want to give it a shot!

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.390
We entered the long and difficult path.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.380
Then cut a hole in the wall,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.280
to sneak into the short and easy path.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.790
My butt hurts...

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.510
I didn't expect a slide

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.630
for the short and easy path.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.640
Three of them...

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.180
Thirty seconds remain.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.680
That was really close.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.980
My hands are covered with blisters.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.560
Same here.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.310
Leorio, applicant #403,
is the twenty-third to pass.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.820
My hands are blistered,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.670
but all five of us cleared
the tower together.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.510
All thanks to Gon!

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.790
The Third Phase of the exam is over.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.110
Twenty-five applicants have passed.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.580
One has died.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.190
"And so,

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:22.590
I've completed the exam's
Third Phase, Mito-san.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.790
I don't know how many are left,

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.800
but I'll pass them all

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.560
and become a Hunter, just like Dad.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.610
Until next time,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.870
Gon Freecss."

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.680
Ging, your son is following

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.650
in your footsteps.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.250
Well?

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.550
Are you happy?

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.050
Next time: Hit x The x Target!

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.550
Be sneaky like Hisoka!

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:29.760
Hit and run.
