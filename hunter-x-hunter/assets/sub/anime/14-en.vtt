00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.260
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.440
We entered the long and difficult path.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.370
Then cut a hole in the wall,

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.060
to sneak into the short and easy path.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190
<i>In an extreme situation,</i>

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.090
<i>you were able to calmly evaluate</i>

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.810
<i>our two options and circumvent them.</i>

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.320
<i>That's what makes you special.</i>

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.320
Hit x The x Target

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.830
The twenty-four applicants who have passed

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.830
the exam's Third Phase

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.330
exit Trick Tower, one by one,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.640
for a long-awaited breath of fresh air.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.360
Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations
on having escaped Trick Tower.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.240
Only the Fourth Phase and
the Final Phase remain.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.870
Two more...

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.570
The Fourth Phase will take place
over there, on Zevil Island.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.250
Let us proceed.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.910
I will need you to draw lots.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.930
Lots?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.310
For what?

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.060
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.560
In here are twenty-four numbered cards.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.200
In other words, your ID numbers
are on the cards.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.420
Now, I need you each to draw a card,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.700
in the order by which you
exited the tower.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.200
Will the first person come forward?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.230
Guess I'm next.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.530
I'm next.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.910
Hey, Killua.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.500
Huh?

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.250
He said something about hunting
and being hunted.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.230
Does that mean we'll be
fighting each other?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.510
Yeah, probably.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.400
I don't know what this is all about,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.800
but I draw with style...

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.430
Everyone's taken a card?

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.940
Then, remove the seal from your card.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.160
The card indicates your target.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.940
This box has recorded which card

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.350
each of you drew.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.280
This means that you're free

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.480
to dispose of the cards if you wish.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.020
The objective

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.980
is to steal your target's ID tag.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.480
Oh, so we don't need to kill each other.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.280
Naturally, you're free to use
any method you choose

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.080
to steal the ID tags.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.240
Including killing your target and
taking the tag off the corpse.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.570
That sounds like the fastest way.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.780
S-So that's what this is about?

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.000
Fool, there's nothing to be scared of.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.500
Listen carefully!

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.010
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.760
Your own ID is also worth three points.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.520
All other ID tags are worth one point.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.650
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.580
So while on Zevil Island,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.680
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.480
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.890
I'd like to commend everyone on board

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.050
for their excellent work during the
Hunter Exam's Third Phase!

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.340
I will serve as your guide.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.300
My name is Khara!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.810
It will take two hours for
this boat to reach Zevil Island.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.880
All twenty-four applicants remaining here

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.190
are automatically qualified
to take next year's exam!

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.690
So if you fail this year, don't feel bad.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.700
Please try again next year...

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.200
<i>Th-This is so depressing.</i>

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.080
The battle has already begun.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.880
Yeah, everyone's removed their ID tags,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.840
and hid them.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.830
Well, you're free to do as you like,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.200
for the next two hours.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.180
Please enjoy the boat ride.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.380
Speaking hypothetically...

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.640
If you happened to be my target,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.450
I wouldn't show any mercy.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.250
Naturally.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.720
If you happened to be my target,

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.960
Am I your target?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.460
I was speaking hypothetically.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.750
Oh, right...

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.060
Don't worry.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.330
You are not my target.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.720
I-I see...

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.220
And you aren't my target!

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.050
Yo.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.910
What number did you draw?

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.680
How about you?

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.820
Secret.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.760
Don't worry.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.300
You aren't my target.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.800
And my target isn't you.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.090
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.310
Okay!

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.310
Ready, and...

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.160
#44 is...

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:51.820
Seriously?

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.510
You have really bad luck...

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.430
You think so?

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.880
Who's #199?

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.030
You don't know, either?

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.880
Uh-uh.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.250
I didn't bother to memorize
everyone's numbers.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.920
After the initial explanation,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.070
I started checking tags,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.790
but everyone had already removed them.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.270
That's so lame...

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.580
Gon...

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.920
Huh?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.970
What?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.920
Are you happy?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.530
Or scared?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.400
Both, I guess...

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.130
In a straight-up fight,

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.550
I wouldn't stand a chance.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.000
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.650
then I have a real shot.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:53.800
Yeah.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.090
Right now,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.220
I might actually have a chance.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.310
That scares me a little...

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.380
But I think it's worth it.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.810
I see.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.340
Well, let's do our best.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.570
Make sure you stay alive, Gon.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.480
Uh-huh!

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.860
You, too.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.740
Thanks for your patience, everyone.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.210
We've finally arrived at Zevil Island!

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:36.210
Now, please disembark in the order by which

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.840
you cleared the Third Phase.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.930
Tsk...

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.100
This again.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.300
After each person disembarks,

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.890
we'll wait two minutes before
the next person's turn.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.290
That means we'll be waiting
here a while.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.380
Yeah.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.110
You will stay on this island
for exactly one week.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.270
During that time,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.990
you must amass your six points
of ID tags and return here.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.740
All right then, the first person may start!

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.470
I understand...

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.850
Those who disembark earlier
hold the advantage.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:17.630
Yeah.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:20.300
They can hide and monitor

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.390
their target's movements.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.560
Two minutes have passed.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.580
The second person may start!

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.900
The third person may start.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.650
Yeah!

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.650
The seventh person...

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.740
The eleventh person...

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.050
The fifteenth person...

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.910
The twentieth person may start.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.480
Two minutes have passed.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.670
The twenty-first person may start!

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.720
See ya.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.590
Uh-huh.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.550
Well,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.320
guess I'll begin by scouting the island.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:11.860
Two minutes have passed.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.940
The twenty-second person may start.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.020
Okay!

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.300
See you...

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.130
Yeah!

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.070
<i>First, I need to find Hisoka!</i>

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:35.170
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.170
Zevil Island

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.010
<i>How do I steal Hisoka's ID tag?</i>

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.180
<i>Such a good boy.</i>

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.360
<i>Very nice.</i>

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.570
<i>I'm getting excited now...</i>

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:18.360
<i>I won't be able to steal his tag
with a head-on attack...</i>

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.740
<i>It's another applicant.</i>

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.430
<i>And another one is behind him.</i>

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.690
<i>He's targeting the guy in front.</i>

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.020
<i>He blew it!</i>

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.770
Hey, that was close.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.310
Sorry, but it won't be that easy...

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.530
That easy...

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.990
Wh-What?

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.700
B-Bastard...

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.320
The arrow was coated with
a fast acting tranquilizer.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080
You won't be able to walk
for the next week.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:42.740
Don't worry.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.420
There's water nearby.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.920
You won't die.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.190
I'll be taking this.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.800
See ya.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.380
<i>Wow.</i>

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.120
<i>He was able to mask his own presence</i>

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.190
<i>as he stalked his prey.</i>

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.900
<i>And his target was able to
sense the shot being fired,</i>

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.150
<i>and quickly dodge it,</i>

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.980
<i>avoiding serious injury.</i>

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.160
<i>However,</i>

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.290
<i>the other applicant anticipated this,</i>

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.200
<i>and poisoned his arrow...</i>

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.490
<i>This is how you hunt!</i>

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.300
<i>If I have any chance at
stealing Hisoka's ID tag,</i>

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.590
<i>this is it!</i>

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.020
<i>First, I have to sneak up on him</i>

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.230
<i>without being noticed.</i>

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.730
<i>Then I wait for my chance,</i>

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.070
<i>and steal his tag!</i>

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.110
Yeah!

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.080
<i>But unlike this target,
Hisoka will be moving...</i>

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.800
<i>Regardless, I'll only get one shot.</i>

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.880
<i>I have to hook Hisoka's tag</i>

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.640
<i>when he isn't paying attention.</i>

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.830
Okay...

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.390
<i>Read his movements...</i>

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.490
Now!

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.750
Hmm...

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.800
This isn't quite right...

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.510
It's too easy to predict

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.800
how a swinging target will move.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.410
That's right.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.440
I shouldn't forget that Hisoka will
try to move out of the way.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.540
<i>If I can't get a bird</i>

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.250
<i>by watching how it moves,</i>

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.030
<i>I'll never be able to steal Hisoka's ID!</i>

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.240
Huh?

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.300
Oh, well!

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.980
I won't catch a bird on the
first or second try.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.720
There!

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.040
Whose number is this?

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.500
The sun's about to set...

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.720
I should probably stay in one place
until tomorrow morning.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.860
Damn...

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.810
I didn't think it would be so hard.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.380
It's too dark for me to see anything.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.810
And all the birds are gone...

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.170
Okay...

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.730
I'll catch one tomorrow!

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.360
Right!

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.080
Back to training!

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.330
It's no use.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.520
Maybe it's not possible, after all.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.150
To catch a bird,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.620
with accuracy, while it's in flight...

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.290
<i>Birds can catch fish that are swimming.</i>

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.800
<i>Go!</i>

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.690
<i>I get it...</i>

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.940
<i>There's a moment</i>

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.940
<i>when I know exactly what
my target will do next!</i>

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.090
<i>Now!</i>

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.160
I did it!

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.360
<i>I figured it out!</i>

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.560
<i>I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!</i>

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.550
<i>Heh.</i>

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.270
<i>He actually mastered
the art of hunting.</i>

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.560
<i>Impressive little boy...</i>

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:40.140
<i>But that intense concentration
will be your undoing.</i>

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.690
Gon finally mastered the trick that
would help him hunt Hisoka.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:53.610
However, Gon was also being hunted.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.380
Next time: Explosion x Of x Deception!

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.010
Explode!

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.700
Explode...

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.800
Ka-boom!

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.140
Oh, mushroom.
