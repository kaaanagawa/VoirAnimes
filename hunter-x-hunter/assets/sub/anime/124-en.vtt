00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.480
Approximately thirty minutes after
the Hunters entered the palace...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.650
As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.060
an immense number of citizens
hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.600
still waited outside for the selection process
that would turn them into soldier ants.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.530
Meanwhile, a creature in the form that
they would soon become began to stir.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.030
Breakdown x And x Awakening

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.550
Okay, all charged up.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.030
Someone's watching me.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.250
And...

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.910
It's probably someone I know.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.010
No one's there?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.530
While her appearance hadn't totally changed,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.060
Palm was clearly no longer the same person.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.230
And that greatly disturbed Killua.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.240
She was captured

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.070
by the Royal Guard...

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.070
And she's been transformed!

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.740
If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.710
he won't be able to take it...

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.570
There's no room left in his heart.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.090
If the transformation has
reached as far as Palm's heart...

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.510
I can see Gon completely breaking down!

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.610
I must learn the answer.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.790
We still have a chance.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.830
Palm approached me herself!

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.870
Palm?

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.570
Palm must have sensed me

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.000
before I noticed her watching me...

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.020
Using that power she told us about before.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.080
Once I used my power, it was quite simple.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.780
I thought she could use some kind
of divination to locate people.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.890
But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.980
From her position, Palm shouldn't
have been able to see me...

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.250
The only conclusion is that she was
watching me by some other means.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.290
And if Palm were an enemy,
she would have backed off...

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.910
Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.550
And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't
remember me anymore.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.780
Since she approached me,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.300
she must remember me...

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.510
Remember us!

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.320
Killua, yes?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.090
I knew it...

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.510
She has her memories!

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.230
Where's Gon?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.950
Once he's seen what I've
become, will Gon hate me?

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.610
Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.090
And you're assuming that he
doesn't already hate you.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.970
You're always so spiteful...

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.350
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.990
I have nothing to gain from your pity.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.000
Where's Gon?

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.280
Gon's with Pitou.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.660
He's—

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:50.740
Why can she see me,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.510
but she can't see Gon?

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.750
What's wrong?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.250
Was it chance that you happened to find me?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.440
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.010
You're the one who turned the corner.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.150
Wrong! I sensed you watching me.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.480
That's why I came this way!

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.260
You noticed me first.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.760
Why are you lying?

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.780
Troublesome brat...

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.390
Where's Gon?

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.400
Answer my question first.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.290
Did I notice Palm watching me
only when she physically saw me?

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.200
Does that mean Palm actually
saw me once, then immediately left?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.510
Then she used clairvoyance
to watch me follow her,

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.770
and turned around so it'd look
like she was approaching me?

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.550
For the last time...

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.940
Where's Gon?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.230
I won't tell you.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.200
You're an enemy, aren't you?

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.200
I made a mistake...

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.100
I used my power incorrectly.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.960
When I was brimming with rage,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.610
I should have let my emotions take over!

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.620
Black Widow
Dark Demon Goddess

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.600
Sh-She's dangerous!

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.380
Better to let everything out than hold it in.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.670
That includes my desire to kill you!

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.620
Well? What now?

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.910
Will you die without a word?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.500
Will you die after speaking?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.660
Or will you just die?

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.810
Palm's ability to arm herself by covering
her body with her hair, Black Widow,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.830
varied in appearance according
to her emotional state.

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.510
But defense was its primary function.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.840
What made Black Widow frightening

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.980
was the fact that she could rely on
her hair armor for protection,

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.600
allowing her to devote all
her energy to her attacks.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.370
<i>P-Palm-san! Turn off your </i>Hatsu!

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.550
Palm is an Enhancer.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.880
When everything clicks, it's possible
to become this much stronger?

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.930
I completely blocked the attack,
but I still took damage.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.010
If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.560
But I can't run away.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.990
Gon's mind is already at its limit!

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.010
He's barely holding himself together,
while he waits for Pitou.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.030
I can't let them meet.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.120
Even if Palm's heart is still there...

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.510
It'll have a negative effect now!

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.600
Palm!

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.420
Why are you looking for Gon?

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.570
Depending on why, I might be
willing to tell you where he is.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.310
Huh? Why are you asking now?

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.550
There's no reason...

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.910
I just want to see him.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.820
He's probably nearby.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.660
I'll find him myself.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.660
Once I've killed you!

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.340
Sorry!

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.820
I panicked and called you an enemy...

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.730
But even if you look different,
you're still Palm, right?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.910
Gon is suffering.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.880
Someone he deeply respects
was completely transformed.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.390
That person had his soul taken away.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.240
Right now, Gon is facing off
against the one responsible!

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.970
If you appear before Gon
looking as you do now...

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.960
Gon will...

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.510
totally snap.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.180
So you have to

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.170
call him by his name first.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.290
You must say, "Gon."

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.100
That's the condition.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.730
Tell him you're okay.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.620
Before we entered the palace,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.050
Gon was really worried about you.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.930
Give him some peace of mind...

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.570
He was just buying time.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.270
He had no intention of letting them meet.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.260
That was the idea...

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.990
Help...

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.530
make him feel a little better, if you can...

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:45.430
Only you can do that now!

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.640
No one else...

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:56.830
can do it.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.270
I can't...

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.910
do anything!

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.380
Once he'd said those words,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.420
the dam within him burst.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.770
He's completely defenseless.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.930
Change in plans...

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.030
Kill him now, #1!

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.410
When Palm had infiltrated the palace,

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.710
arriving at the exit Knov had
placed near the stairway,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.100
Pitou's <i>En</i> returned.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:12.300
Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt
as though she'd be crushed to dust,

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.510
she reached the same conclusion Knov had.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:24.060
As she watched Pouf slowly and silently
descend the stairs, she made her decision.

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.870
She plotted to take her own life,

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.010
so she would look like a despairing girl
who could not bear Bizeff violating her.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.080
However, Pitou prevented that from happening.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:42.550
As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.470
no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:50.090
to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura
at the moment she was exposed to it.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.180
The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.970
and after receiving permission from the fasting King,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:02.010
Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.850
Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.520
their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:15.830
This was most noticeable in Ants who
had learned how to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:21.690
Memories of the past tended to both assist
and deter the growth of soldiers.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.550
Deterrence generally happened

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.900
when memories led to emotional reactions.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:35.100
Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded
that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.330
to destroy the connection between
Palm's memories and her emotions.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.140
The experiments that produced Cheetu
and Leol confirmed that those

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.640
who retained more of their memories
emerged from their cocoons sooner.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.440
To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.680
leaving soldiers with their memories, while
keeping control of them, would be best.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.330
Palm was the perfect test subject.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.660
The success of her experiment would
signify the end of the human race.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.470
Now go, #1...

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.910
Beat the kid before you to death!

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.000
Shut up.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.970
I am

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.880
Palm Siberia.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.240
I'm not #1!

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.500
I will never become a pawn to you Ants...

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.310
Even if it costs my life!

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.180
Killua...

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.240
I have you to thank.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.350
There was a wall inside my head.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.860
My emotions were separated from my body.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.320
I couldn't do anything about it.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.100
I've been like this since I woke up.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.280
You removed the barrier.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.170
Don't say that there's nothing you can do.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.110
If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.660
But you must not forget...

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.110
You are the one Gon needs most.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.470
What is it?

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.420
Failure.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.570
That's all there is to it.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.710
Slow and steady it is.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.470
Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.740
Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.240
I can create soldiers on my own!

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.260
That will make it easier
to build a new kingdom

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.740
for the King and me.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.620
Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.580
Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?
