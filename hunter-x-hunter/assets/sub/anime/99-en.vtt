WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
After Gon parts ways with Killua
in order to stop the selection,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.090
he finds himself under attack
by new Chimera Ants.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.310
An owl and a bat?

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.120
They're both nocturnal creatures...

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.020
Hunters of the night!

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.040
From the left?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.160
Bring it!

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.730
The owl's feathers?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.900
Damn...

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.620
The bat's wings are so loud,
I can't hear the owl at all!

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.010
Combination x And x Evolution

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.770
My ears can pick up sounds of
higher frequency than other animals'.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.910
I can hear you stepping on leaves
and your clothes rustling.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.280
All of which tell me exactly where you are!

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.530
From the right this time!

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.230
The owl uses its feathers to distract me

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.290
right before the bat attacks...

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.790
They're using both long- and short-range attacks.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.720
Wait...

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.170
That means...

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.350
He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.850
We are unrivaled in the darkness!

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.960
I should approach this the opposite way!

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.400
If the owl is acting in a support role,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.540
I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.610
Right after the owl attacks,
the bat will attack!

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.100
Now!

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.240
Bingo!

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.430
I missed?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.690
But my timing was perfect!

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.370
Ultrasonic waves?

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.250
Damn, I missed again?

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.940
Bah, he's correctly guessing
the direction of my attacks.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.510
For a human, his ears are sharp.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.000
And his aura keeps growing,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.920
so my feathers aren't doing any damage.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.880
The bat uses ultrasonic waves to
anticipate the timing of my attack.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.610
Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.810
First comes rock...

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.580
His aura continues to grow.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.250
This could pose a problem.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.160
Not at all...

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.020
This is our chance.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.130
He's probably using his ultimate attack.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.170
If we can evade it, we've won.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.170
I can use my ultrasonic waves
to see it in advance.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.990
Do you need help?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.300
Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.930
The sound's moving away.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.820
The sound's gone!

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.580
Now, with no wingbeats...

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.820
I dive!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.330
That won't work!

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.080
Your wings aren't like the owl's,
so I can hear you slice through the air.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.830
Now, show me your ultimate attack.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.230
He isn't acting?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.660
I guess a human can only hear so much.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.480
In that case, I'll make my move...

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.370
I'll slash your jugular!

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.100
Keep my motions minimal.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.350
Wait until I draw her as near as possible!

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.300
He was baiting me?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.100
I'm in trouble.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.440
But his punch will take a
few milliseconds to land.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.670
I have plenty of time to fly away!

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.790
The noise...

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.980
I can't see.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.980
I must get away!

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.960
You won't escape!

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.790
Rock...

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.090
You aren't the only one that can use sound...

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.920
Paper...

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.720
...to locate others.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.350
Paper!

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.350
All right.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.040
A rock?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.410
He used that to deflect my shot?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.940
Gorilla Mode

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.400
That was close...

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.420
Damn it!

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.730
I used my special attack and
still couldn't bring it down!

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.700
What was that?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.140
There was a sound that made my head spin.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.340
Is this ultrasound, too?

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.880
That stupid kid has a loud voice...

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.970
But I'm much better at attacking with sound!

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.900
This is the true power of their combination.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.230
They strike with sound and finish with brawn.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.730
What now?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.500
Do I cover my ears?

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.720
No, I can't...

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.230
In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing,
my reaction time will suffer.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.280
I know!

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.610
Gyo!

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.620
His eyes are shining?

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.370
Or is that aura?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.370
He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.120
Let's give him another...

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.120
Ultrasonic Dissonance

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.120
Secret Noise!

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.610
Okay!

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.970
This should help some.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.420
He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.890
Water significantly weakens the power of sound!

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.950
Good, this is better...

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.030
I can locate the owl through its aura.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:09.740
Here it comes!

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.240
A feather?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.650
Zetsu.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.860
Of course... They started off as wild animals.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.100
From birth, they've known
to conceal themselves

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.130
when approaching their prey!

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:32.160
I can fend off their attacks,
but the ultrasound really hurts.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.020
<i>If I don't keep up the</i> Gyo,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.640
they'll take me down before
I can even find them!

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.320
In terms of latent aura,
the kid has a clear advantage.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.150
Even after being hit all those times,
he's taken no damage.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.920
But his level of capability is irrelevant.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.710
Without a strategy, he's just a moving target.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.190
They work in perfect sync.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.040
I have to disrupt that!

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:04.800
Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top
of me, we can't use ultrasound.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.350
Wrong guess!

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.400
If I use Rock, I can defeat this one.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.770
But then the bat might run
and warn the other Ants!

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.430
To me, a starry night is as bright as day.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.010
As long as I'm not in total darkness,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:29.070
I can see you without needing
to rely on my hearing!

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.160
So if I cover my ears...

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.580
I can attack at will!

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:43.620
The kid has shrouded his entire
body in aura to avoid damage.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.770
But that reduces the strength of his attacks,
making it impossible to stand against them.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.890
At this rate, he'll never defeat them...

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.600
It's over for this kid.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.610
Their weakness is that

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.850
their movements are always in sync!

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.110
Here!

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.790
They always take positions on opposite sides

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.850
to avoid both being targeted at once.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.660
When the owl is in front of me,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.000
the bat is directly behind me!

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.250
A giant wall?

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.620
The real wall was

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.020
behind me...

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.030
He turned our teamwork against us?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.280
If I only have one opponent,
I can concentrate on attacking.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.590
Once he pulls off one plan,
things will go his way...

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.380
But that attack won't be enough
to get him anywhere here.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:08.850
Damn!

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.680
First comes rock...

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.900
Rock... Paper...

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.050
Why, you...

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.230
Rock!

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.190
I made sure to knock you west!

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.590
Go back to NGL!

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.710
That was incredibly strong...

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.700
I see... This is his real ultimate attack.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.580
I take back what I said.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.950
This kid can be useful.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.700
But how do I proceed?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.210
Diego has been dethroned.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.840
Brainwashed soldiers are running around,
slaughtering entire villages and towns!

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.900
Diego has fallen?

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.270
Is that true?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.220
But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.090
There's no time to think about it!

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.100
Just leave this village and run, anywhere!

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.740
Warn people in other areas!

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.970
Who's interfering?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.020
It was in the southeast this time.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.200
Some of my puppets have been stopped.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.740
That was fast.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.680
Whoever they are, they're keeping
low and unpredictable.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.820
An assassin?

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.750
But they are acting on their own...

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.460
A decoy?

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.290
This is so annoying...

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.380
I wanna kill them!

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.990
It is no more than a diversion.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:39.890
Which means we cannot go.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.900
You think?

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.140
But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.900
They're being careful not to let me catch them...

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.540
It may all be an act to draw you out.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.070
But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.400
But... But...

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.660
Ah, how I long to indulge myself
in the delight of agonizing...

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.690
It is the sweet trap of the thought process.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.850
Nothing more.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.620
The answer is simple.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.900
Our mission is to protect the King.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.160
We can let the other Ants handle the rest.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.930
Is it our turn?

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.810
When we were injured

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.710
and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in.

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.640
You even gave us instruction on using our power.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.700
It is time for us to return the favor!

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.450
Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.090
Can you kill them?

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.040
You can count on me.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.960
Take this cell phone.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.960
We can't use telepathy.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.690
I'll give you updates on their location.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:00.990
Understood.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.980
Can we really trust them?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.100
Nah, I don't trust them.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.020
They're the ones trying to earn our trust,

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.700
so they'll try hard to carry out their mission.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.610
It's possible that they're looking for an
opportunity to stab us in the back.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:30.280
In that case, we should treat them accordingly.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.370
The closest village is at two o'clock.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.630
The next closest villages are
at eight and ten o'clock...

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.630
Should I skip them and head for
Taba, forty kilometers away?

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.390
Play it safe...

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.140
Don't let anyone find me.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.150
I can't go this way.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:17.770
This is bad...

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.180
I should have taken matters into my own hands.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.110
What's wrong?

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.470
As we speak, Cheetu is racing
toward East Gorteau.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.090
It seems the Hunters that replaced
us failed to capture him.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.950
Is he headed toward us?

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.690
No, if he continues on his current
course, he'll pass far to the south.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.690
Where are you going?

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.430
Don't try to stop me...

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.950
I'm already in a bad mood.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.980
The Hunter Association has captured three
hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.170
outside of NGL as of yesterday.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.460
But Colt confirmed that none of
them were Squadron Leaders.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.410
According to him,

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.950
there are eight Squadron Leaders left
that would be considered aggressive.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:07.470
Hunters have encountered four,
but they all got away.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:12.100
Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.680
He must know the King is here.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.730
He's choosing to return to the King's
service in order to increase his power.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:26.360
My ability is still in effect,
and I have more raw strength.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.650
But if we let him slip away and
he gains even more power,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.740
there's no telling who will win next time.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.000
If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:40.470
we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.410
Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.210
If you are, I'll fight you first.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.240
First, we contact Morel-san.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.270
If worse comes to worst,
he'll need to replace us.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.270
I'll come with you.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.510
This should increase the odds
of capturing that Ant.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.620
It's Knuckle... Something's come up.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.330
Yes, I'd guess so.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.030
Probably.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.470
Yes.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.290
So, uh...

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.550
Hello? Hello?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.040
Fools!

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.820
I told you to send Riakke!

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.450
He'd have been perfect for this.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.910
Huh?!

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.800
I don't give a damn!

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.060
What's wrong?

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.840
The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.420
The review board didn't send
the Hunter we requested!

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.840
Who did they send?

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.570
Some Hunter I've never heard of.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.340
Probably an Association dog.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.820
An Association dog...

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.590
You mean Hunters who only take jobs
through the Hunter Association.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.330
It isn't surprising that they have less talent.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.810
Damn! I should have gone
to talk to Riakke myself!

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.400
Don't be foolish!

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.830
If you do anything without board approval,

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.840
the Chairman will get all the grief.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:18.350
He had to argue with the executive
committee just to get the two of us here.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.240
But they don't understand the situation.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.610
They base it on past accomplishments
and donations to the Association...

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.890
The review board has always been inflexible.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.620
How can you be so relaxed?!

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.780
If we underestimate the Squadron
Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.090
They're strong.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.540
After all, they listen to their deepest desires.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.400
So they have the talent to quickly master

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.180
the abilities they need the most.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:57.510
If we let the review board bring self-preservation
and formality in, we won't get help in time.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.060
Maybe that's their goal...

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.030
You refer to the rumors that
the Vice-Chairman's faction

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.070
controls the review board?

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.410
That they're only giving work to Hunters

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.550
who agree to vote for him in the next election?

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.260
There's no evidence of anything
like that happening.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.630
You think they're stupid enough to get caught?

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.850
Look at the facts!

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:30.480
They've let every Squadron Leader
they've faced escape alive!

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:38.150
If this expedition fails,
the Chairman will shoulder the blame.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.010
They're willing to do whatever it
takes to guarantee that result.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.400
As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.610
the voices calling for the Chairman's
resignation grow louder.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.110
Too bad the voices belong to a bunch
of people sitting at their desks!

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:59.190
If we take out the King and five million
people are already dead, we've failed!

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.170
We already knew that.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.120
The Chairman is prepared.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.400
When he developed this plan, he was
well aware of the consequences.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.520
He knew how long assuring victory would take,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.630
and the resulting casualties...

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.640
Five million is the low end...

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.200
That's too high!

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.230
Marcos-san?

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.150
What?

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.150
The phones have been ringing nonstop!

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.910
Rumors of a coup d'état are flying around.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.150
And it's been discovered that mass murders
are taking place all over the nation.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.860
This is no rumor. It's actually happening!

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.580
What's going on here?

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.670
Are you responsible for this?

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.790
We haven't done anything!

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.920
The citizens have learned the
truth about the selection?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.080
We'll discuss this later.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.090
Return to the office before anyone suspects you.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.920
Morel!

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:08.190
Our beloved leader, Diego, has an
urgent announcement to make.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.940
To ensure that our great leader's message
will be heard throughout the nation,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.680
we request that relay speakers in all
regions be turned to maximum volume.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:23.200
All televisions and radios should be on,
and the volume raised to maximum.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.440
Good evening, my beloved comrades.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.070
I am Diego.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.800
I have just declared that East
Gorteau is under martial law.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.220
This precaution is being taken to combat
malcontents that would foment rebellion.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.260
I ask all comrades to stay indoors,
with your doors locked.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.540
Anyone outdoors without permission will
be identified as a rebel and punished.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.750
I ask that you not lend an ear
to false rumors being spread,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.210
but that you follow my instructions.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:03.680
The soldiers of my special forces
will be visiting your residences,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.240
to see if any rebels are hiding inside.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.250
Do not open your doors for anyone else.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.800
Their response was too fast.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.680
It must be Killua and Gon.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.290
They weren't supposed to act.

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.870
But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.510
They were so well-prepared,
I can't believe otherwise.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.970
The citizens learning the truth about
the selection wasn't important.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.330
In fact, if they did, the military
would have an excuse to mobilize.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.770
East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:43.620
completely isolated from the rest of the world.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.480
Hmm... No problem.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.400
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.060
I will stop them all.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.900
Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.840
98!

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.540
99!

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.270
100!

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.410
We want to thank everyone...

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.570
...for helping us reach 100 episodes!

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.420
Thank you!

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:29.760
We hope you keep watching!
