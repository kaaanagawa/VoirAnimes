WEBVTT

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.440
We didn't learn what happened to Uvo,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.820
but we have the chain user's name and face.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.130
We still don't know his abilities.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.700
All right.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.080
We'll be waiting in the Hotel Beitacle lobby.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.580
It sounds like we got the
chain user's identity.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.690
He has three remaining allies.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.090
Let's go.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.600
Let's go.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.960
What do we do?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.540
There isn't any point in
capturing Pakunoda now.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.060
If I were Kurapika, I would switch targets.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.820
If I wanted to crush the Troupe,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.600
I would target the boss.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.580
Melody's listening in on the conversation,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.770
so they should know where we're going.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.940
It's a question of when he'll attack.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.370
We'll need to confer before we move.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.370
The first instant will decide it.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.960
Any slight delay could cost us our lives.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.040
Initiative x And x Law

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.510
Wait here.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.520
They're too alert...

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.860
They'll be watching anyone who walks in.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.730
I hope Kurapika and Melody
arrived before us.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.030
Hey!

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.280
Do you realize what time it is?!

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.970
Idiot! It's Hotel Beitacle!

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.170
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.290
Leorio!

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.670
What are you looking at, eh?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.180
Should I get rid of him?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.170
Ignore him.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.420
Don't look at him.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.540
Eh? This ain't no show!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.680
Damn, my future's <i>dark</i>

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.730
because of the failures working for me!

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.620
Listen up!

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.560
This once, I'll <i>close my eyes</i>
like nothing happened.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.560
One more mistake, and you'll get it good!

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.320
Now listen.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.000
Seven on the dot.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.560
You'd best be at the hotel by then!

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.120
That's a message!

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.920
Seven on the dot!

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.440
Use darkness to our advantage!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.500
I can escape these threads instantly

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.250
by dislocating my fingers.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.490
I'll need 0.7 seconds to attack.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.470
I'll have plenty of time!

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.830
It'll take a few seconds before

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.650
their eyes adjust to the dark

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.940
if the lights suddenly go out!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.460
It's time for our last song.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.250
This request comes from Kicchomu-san.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.100
Three more minutes!

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.100
Paku and the others are here.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.370
Oh?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.350
What's this? You got caught again?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.750
I get it...

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.730
You changed your minds and
decided to join, right?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.090
We didn't know that the reward
for you guys was rescinded.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.080
So you screwed up again while stalking us?

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.740
Didn't learn your lesson, huh?

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.720
But this must be fate at work.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.120
Two more minutes.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.880
Well, let's be friends.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.110
No way.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.480
We were only following you for the reward.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.880
I wouldn't even want to look at your faces.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.350
Smart!

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.140
Now we won't seem suspicious
when we close our eyes.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.790
I agree.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.780
Well, boss?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.140
They've got guts, right?

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.150
Their sass reminds me of Uvo.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.450
That's probably because they're kids.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.520
They know no fear.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.840
Anyway, describe the chain user for us.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.770
First things first, Paku.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.910
Check these kids again.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.540
Okay, what do you want to know?

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.040
What are they hiding?

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.060
Damn, that's a smart question.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.580
Straight to the point,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.290
and he can learn all kinds
of information from it.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.870
Well, there's only one minute left

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.460
in this week's broadcast.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.810
One minute! We have to buy time!

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.560
It's no use.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.350
Your power

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.890
lets you draw out memories
from those you touch, right?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.480
We aren't hiding anything,
and we know no—

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.140
I'll know the truth soon enough.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.320
Shut up.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.860
Even if we did know something,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.480
we could think about something else,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.700
and hide it from you!

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.200
Yep, there you go.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.120
You seem to be confused.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.350
I draw out the purest essence of human memory.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.210
I'm not browsing through
the images in your mind.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.450
My question will stimulate your memory,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.420
stirring up the dirt collected in its depths

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.400
like throwing a stone into a pond.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.350
The dirt represents your pure,
unaltered memories.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.560
And I simply scoop them up.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.640
It's impossible to deceive me.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.060
I'll see you next week.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.890
This is JFN, and it's 7:00 PM.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:27.490
Here it comes!

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.490
Now, it's time to ask my question.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.840
What are you hiding?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.960
I can see them!

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.390
And they can't see us!

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.810
The kid on the right is free?

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.850
I can't see!

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.020
This was their plan?

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.190
I won't let go of the other one!

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.650
Gon!

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.900
To break the thread, I'll have to kill her!

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.650
I can't pull out my hand...

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.910
She trapped it with her muscles!

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.290
You're mine.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.440
Once you reveal your presence,
I can sense you.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.290
Using the dark was meaningless.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.500
Killua!

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.300
Give up.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.580
A pity...

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.550
Well, it was a good shot.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.770
It came from the entrance?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.270
The guy with the radio was
working with them.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.700
Forget him!

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.930
We only need these two.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.270
Our eyes will adjust shortly.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.210
Yes.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.780
Wait, where's the boss?

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.910
The boss is gone...

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.910
Shizuku, hold this guy for me.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.500
Sure.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.490
Paku, are you okay?

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.750
He broke my left hand and a molar...

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.530
We underestimated them.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.160
Anyway, this is going to shock you.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.990
These kids are—

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.890
Wait!

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.390
Pakunoda, this is for you.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.390
Discuss their memories, and I'll kill him.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.740
Hey, what's going on?

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.110
We missed him because he was
disguised as a receptionist!

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.290
And, wait... the boss should have

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.880
been able to evade a chain
attack from that distance.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.420
But the abrupt plunge

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.080
into darkness delayed his reactions.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.640
This was all planned out!

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:52.430
radio

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.450
But I was only able to learn keywords

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.430
what are you hiding?

missed him

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.430
such as "blackout" and "seven o'clock."

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.710
And there's one more question...

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.850
If these kids knew the chain user all along,

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.130
why didn't my previous questioning
trigger any memories?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.950
He must have been hiding his powers

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.520
from his own allies!

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.620
From all that, we can surmise
that he is most likely intelligent,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.240
quick on his feet, secretive,
and level headed.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.240
He probably isn't bluffing.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.220
He was prepared to sacrifice a few
seconds to leave this message.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.790
Which means the message must be true.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.530
His ally can read human emotion

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:41.320
by listening to heartbeats.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.230
That ally is the reason he
left this message behind.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.990
If I talk, he'll sacrifice his own
allies and kill the boss.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.560
But that also means that these
kids are valuable as hostages.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.330
Paku.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.260
We have a chance to rescue the boss.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.910
Paku...

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.420
But...

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.290
Paku!

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.880
Don't say a word.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:07.380
Got it?

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.300
Machi, focus on your threads.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.630
I'll take him for you.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.010
Kurapika pulled it off.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.330
Since he left us a message,

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.720
he'll contact us again.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:25.310
Until then, these kids are valuable hostages.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.270
I am the head,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.660
and you are the legs of the spider.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.730
Natural law dictates that the
legs blindly follow the head.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.480
However, this simply represents
a chain of command.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.260
It doesn't apply to my life or death.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.200
If I happen to die, one of you can replace me.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.920
And there may come a time when a leg
has more importance than the head.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.930
Make the right call.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.480
My orders are top priority.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.430
However, I am not your top priority.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.640
Our goal is not to keep an individual alive,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.000
but the spider.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.390
Never forget that.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.690
What should we do in this situation?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.440
If I tell everyone the chain
user's powers and weaknesses

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.320
that I learned, we can defeat him.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.580
With ease.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.700
But that will probably lead
to the boss' death.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.450
Uvo must have faced a similar decision.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.550
He died for the spider.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.210
Died?

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.010
What did that fortune from the boss say?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:38.220
On a dark day with very little light,
you will face two choices within a small room.
You must choose between pride and betrayal.
While the death-bringer hovers near.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.680
Two choices...

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.520
Would it be considered betrayal to speak?

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.220
Or would it be considered betrayal to lie?

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.720
It is the spider that must be kept alive.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.760
Right...

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.820
I'm thinking too hard.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.890
Paku,

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.010
don't worry about it too much.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.400
Just keep your mouth shut.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.360
Hurry, Phinks!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.680
The boss has been captured!

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.290
Boss...

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.160
We still need you.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.040
Even if it means

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.600
I must betray the spider.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.260
It's okay.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.370
A number of the enemies were injured.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.260
They won't move until reinforcements arrive.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.980
What are you looking at?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.770
Nothing.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.060
I didn't expect the chain user to be a woman.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.020
Did I say that I was?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.920
You shouldn't let appearances deceive you.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.530
Anyway, you should watch what you say.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.720
Since it may be the last
thing out of your mouth.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.250
You won't kill me.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.160
You left your precious friends behind.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.710
I'm not so composed that
I will ignore your taunts!

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.790
Kurapika!

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.550
That's enough.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.960
The girl's fortune didn't mention this.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.270
Therefore, this event

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.560
isn't significant enough to matter.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.100
You bastard!

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.350
Kurapika!

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.370
If you kill him, I'll kick your ass!

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.820
Do you need further explanation?

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.570
I consider this situation

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.740
the same as an afternoon coffee break.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.870
A peaceful outing.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.990
Calm down, Kurapika!

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.560
We're on equal footing now!

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.780
Nothing has changed.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.680
Equal footing?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.250
You are sorely mistaken.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.930
First of all, you've made
the wrong assumption.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.130
I have no value as a hostage.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.670
If you insist on babbling...

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.850
He isn't lying.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.350
Everything he says is true.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.140
There you go.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.800
This is reality.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.860
You people are the ones on the ropes.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.620
What do you mean?

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.150
His heartbeat is normal.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.860
He isn't shaken by any of this.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.890
He isn't worried or frightened of death.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.230
I can hear that he's accepted death.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.870
I can hear that he walks
with death every day.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.510
How is he capable of producing such a sound?

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.930
No more!

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.540
I can't take any more of this!

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.010
I don't want to listen to you or him!

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.910
Melody...

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:27.060
He truly believes that he has
no value as a hostage.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.520
But the fact remains that he is the leader.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.270
What are you...

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.910
What are you people?

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.950
The spider.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.780
Explain.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.300
The lights went out.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.910
The boss was taken in that instant.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.490
Here's the message from the chain user.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.160
Why didn't you go after him immediately?

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.460
Machi and Paku were injured.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.350
So?

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.420
He has allies who are pro Hunters.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.670
So?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.010
Read between the lines!

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.180
It proves we can use these kids as hostages.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.990
If we give chase and let
them escape, it's over!

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.760
The boss has probably been captured

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.130
by those chains that Uvo couldn't break.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.400
It'll be difficult for him to escape on his own!

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.740
Probably?

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.440
The lights went out!

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.670
By the time our eyes adjusted,
the boss was gone.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.450
We weren't in any condition to move.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.230
Okay, we can assign blame later.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.950
For now, we need a plan.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.960
Five years ago, were you the
leader when the Troupe

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:40.010
slaughtered the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.190
Answer me!

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.680
Are those the chains you used to kill Uvo?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.860
What were Uvo's last words?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.180
I don't remember.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:54.610
You're lying.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.510
Am I right, miss?

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.180
I can relate.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.420
I feel the same way.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.170
I have nothing to say to you.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.690
Kurapika, he's trying to provoke you!

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.680
Don't fall for it!

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.680
Damn...

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.110
Damn!

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.700
Damn!

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.310
That proves it.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.460
I'm quite surprised.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.400
The chain user has an exploitable weakness.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.130
I can use this.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.230
It's the boss.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.090
Hello?

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.950
I have three demands.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.230
The chain user?

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.850
The general rule is that my
demands are absolute.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.230
If you don't obey, I will kill
your leader immediately.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.470
First, do not follow me.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.990
Second, do not harm your two hostages.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.270
Third, put that Pakunoda woman on the phone.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.010
Can I ask you something first?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.500
It's about the second demand.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.140
The two hostages put up a struggle,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.880
and we had to break a few bones.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.800
Then we're done negotiating.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.160
What is it?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.780
Sorry, I was lying.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.010
Both of them are unharmed.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.690
This is your last chance.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.470
Do not fool around.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.140
Put Pakunoda on the phone.

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.770
Ow!

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.650
Hello?

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.540
You are the only one allowed
to hear what I say.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.080
Move away from the others.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.000
Did you make contact with
a man named Squala?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.860
Yes.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.240
Are you aware of a woman named Melody?

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.300
I am.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.570
Then this will be quick.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.110
Listen carefully.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.540
You are forbidden from
communicating with your comrades.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.950
No talking, gesturing, writing,
signaling, or making eye contact.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.240
None of that is allowed.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.450
You must come alone to
the place I designate.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.940
If your heart rate changes even in
the slightest, I will kill the hostage.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.060
Understood?

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.310
Now give the phone to someone
besides the previous man.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.190
I'm here.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.230
I'm going to meet with Pakunoda alone.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.690
The rest of you must return to your hideout.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.950
All ten Troupe members must be there.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.090
If a single one is missing, I will kill the hostage.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.000
Understood?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.820
Yeah.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.180
Put Pakunoda back on.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.460
Here.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.680
You're to come to Lingon Airport.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.080
You have until 8:00.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.510
And you must come alone.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.390
Don't hesitate, Pakunoda.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.470
Bring everyone.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.470
He'll put his friends before his mission.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.950
Hey, Paku!

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.230
Wait!

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.540
Let Paku go by herself.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.600
We're returning to the hideout.

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.500
Orders from the chain user.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.220
What's your point?

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.230
If we disobey, he'll kill the boss!

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.490
Are you an idiot?

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.410
If that happens, we kill the chain user.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.490
And that will be the end.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.490
It's what the boss would tell us to do.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:06.000
Nobunaga, you insult the spider.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.320
We have to follow Pakunoda now.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.100
This is an absolute necessity!

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.430
I concur.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.760
There's no point in letting Paku go alone.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.530
If we continue to follow his orders,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.260
the fortunes will come true.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.570
I agree with Nobunaga.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.450
We should follow his orders for now.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.270
I agree.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.680
For now?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.580
How long do we listen to him?

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.890
Until half our limbs are gone?

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.530
Shizuku, what do you think?

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.390
When there's a fight, we flip a coin.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.660
He's broken the rules.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:41.900
But I'll side with Nobunaga.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.480
I don't want the boss to die now.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.910
I don't want Paku to die, either.

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.420
I'm sure Paku feels the same way.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.740
That's why she left without a word.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.900
I don't believe this...

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.560
Talking to you is pointless.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.370
I would love to kill you right now,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.050
but following Pakunoda comes first.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.300
Wait!

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.700
Take one more step,

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.310
and I'll cut you down.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.570
Go ahead and try.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.800
Troupe members aren't allowed to fight.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.330
Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.830
That's what my heart says.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.200
But the rules are absolute.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.480
If we reject the rules, we reject the spider.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.520
And we also reject the boss.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.460
I don't want to do that.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:35.890
It's him.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.840
I'll take it.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.710
Hello—

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.970
Put one of the hostages on the phone.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.060
You little...

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:45.890
Here.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.390
Are they all together?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.620
They are right now.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.480
But they're talking about
going after Pakunoda...

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.120
Watch your mouth, kid.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.120
Hello?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.240
You have thirty minutes to
return to your hideout.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.740
You can try trickery if you want,
but your leader will die.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.600
I'll call again shortly.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.850
We won't be able to follow Paku now.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:08.820
Damn it!

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.630
The boss will die if we ten aren't together?

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:19.630
He's pretty smart to use the
hostages as messengers.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.900
This is the perfect chance to fight the boss.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.280
But if I leave, the boss will die.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.140
There you have it.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.420
Lend me a hand.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.930
Sure.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.280
I've known you a little longer than Chrollo.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.170
Kurapika's revenge has come to fruition.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.420
And his confrontation with the
Troupe has reached its final stage.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:15.920
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.020
Today, we introduce Pakunoda.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.370
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.280
A Specialist.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.710
Her power lets her see memories

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.870
A Specialist.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.090
by touching people and objects.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:15.920
Her rare ability shows her
the memories of the people
or objects she touches.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.180
She can conjure those memories or her own

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.740
into bullets to shoot.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.250
<i>Memory Bomb!</i>

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.420
Next time: Signal x To x Retreat.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.630
What are you doing, Killua?

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.260
Time to retreat.
