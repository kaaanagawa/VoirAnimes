WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Tell the boss...

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.650
I won't go back until I settle up

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.540
with that chain user.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
Chasing x And x Waiting

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.290
Hisoka, who joined the Phantom Troupe

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.040
for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo,

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.040
has proposed that Kurapika,
who seeks revenge

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.260
on the Troupe, join forces with him.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.540
Well? It's your call.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.800
Will you work with me?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.150
Or will you fight alone?

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.270
Go ahead.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.300
It's me.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.830
Kurapika, it's terrible...

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.080
The man we captured has escaped.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200
Escaped? On his own?

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.520
No,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.920
some Troupe members

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.010
disguised themselves as
Mafia and came for him.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020
What about the leader?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.210
We've been unable to reach him.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.700
We're heading toward pattern B.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.290
Return immediately.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.610
I understand.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.100
Hisoka, I have a question for you.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.180
Do you know what became
of the Scarlet Eyes?

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.610
Unfortunately, that was
from before I joined.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.180
The boss sells every item after
admiring it for a while.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.280
The Scarlet Eyes should be no exception.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.720
That is all I know.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.200
But keep this in mind.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.870
A spider will not stop moving
until you crush its head.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.780
I asked if you wanted to team up,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.980
but I was not suggesting that
we fight side by side.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.070
Merely that we exchange information,
in a give-and-take relationship.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.610
If it ceases to be beneficial to either party,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.820
there will be no further
obligation to cooperate.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.300
Simple enough, yes?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.920
What do you say?

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.020
I'll be here tomorrow,
at the same time.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.160
So, what do we do now?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.560
The leader is probably dead.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.420
And we haven't completed the mission...

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.540
Shouldn't we report this to the boss?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.020
That little girl's our boss in name alone.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.370
It was someone else who hired us.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.550
Light Nostrade, her father.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.140
He gave the orders,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.560
and the leader received them.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.150
But the leader was the only one
who knew how to contact him.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.570
It seems we have no choice but to report
what's happened to the boss.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.090
Boss... Boss.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.340
What time is it?

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.090
It's 2 AM.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.940
Huh? What about the auction?!

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.470
It's been called off.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.470
Huh?

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.590
Called off? Why?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.840
The auction was attacked by thieves.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.860
Huh?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.500
Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino
died during the attack.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.080
What?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.540
We can't reach the leader,
so he's probably done for.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.630
No way.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.730
What about the mummy?

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.600
Was it really stolen?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.430
I wanted it so much...

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.120
The Mafia community moved the
merchandise to a safe location.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.960
Oh, that's great!

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.200
So when is the next auction?

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.470
We don't yet know.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.120
What? Why not?

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.620
In any event, the leader
handled all communication,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.390
so we don't know anything.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.990
We cannot act until we have orders.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.640
I don't know anything about that.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.830
So, ask Daddy.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.100
His number's on my phone.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.270
Squala, make the call.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.110
Huh? Why me?!

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.270
You're the most experienced member left.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.170
You should be the leader.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.990
No way!

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.990
Out of the question!

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.090
I'm not the leader type.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.250
Perhaps we should take a vote, to be fair?

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.370
We need to make the call quickly.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.500
I vote for Kurapika.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.370
He was the one who
apprehended the bandit,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.580
and he has shown excellent judgment.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.010
I believe he would make the best leader.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.290
No objections here.
I vote for Kurapika.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.540
That's that...

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.980
You make the call.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.340
I understand.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.620
As the interim leader,
I'll call Mr. Nostrade.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.990
This is only until we confirm
what's become of Dalzollene.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.840
Any final decision will be
Mr. Nostrade's to make.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.010
I never expected to get
a chance so soon...

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.180
It would be inappropriate for
me to call him directly,

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.470
so would you provide an
introduction, boss?

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.020
Sure.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.900
Then, I'm putting him on now.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.700
Hello?

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.560
Is it true that Dalzollene has been killed?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.630
Yes.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.720
I find that hard to believe.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.310
He is a <i>Nen</i> user.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.970
He's trained to withstand

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.890
ten gunshots without sustaining injury.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.740
He was killed by a group of outlaws
known as the Phantom Troupe.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.100
The spiders?

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.610
I had an opportunity to see them in action.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.210
One of them stopped a
bazooka rocket with one hand.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.620
I am Kurapika, the interim leader.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.710
Could you please issue us our orders?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.530
First, I'd like to hear your
opinion as interim leader.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.520
I believe we should

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.780
get your daughter out of
Yorknew City immediately.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.120
If anything unexpected happens,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.310
we would be unable to protect her.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:41.260
I agree with your assessment,
but my daughter also has a say.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.800
I want to respect her wishes when possible.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.240
My top priority is her safety.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.650
I understand.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.850
I'm on my way now.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.660
I should arrive by tomorrow evening.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.750
I shall do my best to persuade Neon.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.040
You will be the new leader, Kurapika.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.390
Here is your first order.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.720
Keep an eye on Neon until I arrive.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.930
Understood.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.790
Your father will arrive tomorrow night.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.840
Really?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.890
Yay!

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.270
I'll get him to buy me lots of clothes.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.520
You are to wait in your room until then.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.180
What?

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.900
I want to see the casino...

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.130
Stay here with the boss.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:30.920
Huh?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.220
S-Sure...

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.700
I'll be downstairs, investigating.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.310
Here we go!

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.470
That building you were in is owned by

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.980
a dummy corporation for
the Nostrade Family.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.940
Can you get a list of buildings

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.030
the Nostrade Family owns in this area?

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.130
Of course!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.950
I can also see if anyone's checked
in using the Nostrade name.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.080
Here, I brought more beer.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.080
Oh, thanks.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.850
Here.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.380
You should get a Hunter License, Uvo.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.530
You can get all kinds of
information from this website,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.350
as long as you have the money.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.670
Unlike you guys, I dislike
the idea of money.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.670
If there's something I want, I take it.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.810
How splendid...

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.360
You are the model thief!

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.860
Here we go.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.360
They own two other buildings.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.020
And there are three hotels
where members are staying...

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.230
Well, this should be a short search.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.370
Thanks.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.290
I appreciate it.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.380
Wh-What was that for?!

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.110
Well, I'm off, then.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.080
What about the beer?

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.760
You guys can finish it.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.260
Make sure you dispose of the body.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.420
Try to make it quick.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:18.760
Yeah.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:20.250
Bye.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.020
Uvo!

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.020
Huh?

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.900
Don't get careless.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.540
Family members?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.190
I'll start with them.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.290
Look at this.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.740
What's that?

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.010
A list of buildings owned
by the Nostrade Family?

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.210
There's a list of Family members...

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.300
I didn't know this information was available.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.990
This website can only be
accessed by pro Hunters.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.250
With this information,
they can locate this room.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.420
A website for pro Hunters...

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.190
Then if one of the enemies is a pro Hunter...

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.920
We're in big trouble.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.200
We need to take the boss
and find a different room.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.830
Eh? In the same hotel?

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.200
It's faster and avoids needless movement.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.820
But we cannot use fake names.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.340
We'll have Melody or Basho register the room.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.050
Make sure everyone,
especially the boss, stays inside.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.070
Got it.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.660
Don't check out of this one.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.220
Kurapika? What about you?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.720
I'll stay here.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.520
Huh?

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.230
You can't mean to...

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.570
I-I don't think that's a Family member.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.260
He's a bodyguard for the boss' daughter...

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.080
Daughter?

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.400
Yeah...

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.840
She's a strange one who
collects human body parts.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.070
Eyeballs and organs...

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.220
Oh, and she's an incredibly
accurate fortune teller.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.590
Fortune teller?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.640
She has a long list of Mafia clients...

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.780
Some community elders basically worship her.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.640
After all, our boss

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.120
made his fortune by using
his daughter's power.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:35.780
Hey...

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.290
C-Cut me some slack?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.640
I told you everything I know.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.480
Please spare me!

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.370
Someone who can see the future...

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.620
She knew the attack would happen?

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.910
The boss was right.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.940
There weren't any traitors.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.540
Currently, we have a 3,000,000 diamond

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.220
and 2,400,000 Jenny in leftover cash.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.390
And we also have the 2,750,000
Jenny from the arm wrestling.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.150
That gives us a total of around 8,000,000.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.710
We need to turn this into at least 9 billion,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.420
the minimum opening bid for <i>Greed Island</i>...

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.410
I don't see how we can manage that
through legitimate channels.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.730
I wouldn't call that arm wrestling legitimate.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.920
All the challengers toward the end were
half desperate losers trying for revenge.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.920
That's fine.
That was my goal.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.890
Huh?

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.500
We want as many people as
possible to embellish the tale.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.930
What do you mean?

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.340
The arm wrestling was meant as bait.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.580
Bait?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.430
To draw out the moles.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.990
Moles? Why do we want moles?

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.330
Pipe down now.
I'll explain everything.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.950
Come on down!

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.110
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.370
We have a diamond worth 3,000,000.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.830
The winner will be determined
through arm wrestling.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.920
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.880
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.150
What? He's just a kid.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.320
I'll give it a shot.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.640
Don't bother.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.760
That kid beat five hundred people yesterday.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.040
Huh?

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.400
Over twenty ended up with broken arms.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.810
Seriously?!

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.580
The stories are spreading nicely.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.880
In that case...

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.370
Move.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.540
Oh, do we have our first challenger?

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.760
No.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.510
Huh?

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.040
I already know that my man
can't beat your kid.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.510
I was watching yesterday.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.810
Then what do you want?

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:56.920
Interested in making some real money?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.540
Meaning?

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.410
I know where you can make big bucks

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.550
instead of the pocket change
you're getting here.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.640
You can make hundreds...

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.100
No, thousands of times more.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.590
Are they moles?

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.710
Yeah, looks like we landed a big fish.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.130
Huh? Fish?

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.460
Don't you mean moles?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.200
Stop talking.
It doesn't matter!

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.580
Here we are.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.780
Oh! I can feel the bloodlust.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.730
The arm wrestling competition here
accepts all comers, and it pays out.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.080
The spectators bet on each match,

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.130
and the winner receives ten
percent of all bets placed.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.000
We're talking billions bet on each match.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.870
That would mean millions with each win!

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.940
You could win even more...

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.620
I'll be taking fifty percent of your
earnings as my commission.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.340
Fifty percent? Isn't that a little high?

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.730
You can't participate
unless I enter your name.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.840
Besides, you can bet your own money.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.670
You'll get great odds with that kid,

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.810
and earn back your stake
a hundred times over.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.060
That's right! I'm in!

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.460
Go, Gon!

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.480
Huh?

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.780
Well? Any other challengers?

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.180
Got one right here!

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.490
This kid's up for the challenge.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.680
Very well.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.350
Sorry, but the arm wrestling is canceled!

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.920
We'll be doing some
conditional auctioning now!

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.300
Why was it canceled?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.510
U-Uh, I don't know.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.010
To win, you must play
hide-and-seek!

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.360
Hide-and-seek?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.110
We'll start by passing out flyers!

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.650
Examine the pictures on the flyer.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:32.410
Those seven people are your targets!

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.390
Hey, that girl with glasses was...

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.160
Yep, she arm wrestled me.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.900
Hey, are they the ones responsible
for what happened last night?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.470
Yeah, you mean the attack on the auction?

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.830
In order to win the bid,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.430
you must capture and deliver a target to us.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.960
For each target brought in,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.810
you will receive a nice sum of 2 billion Jenny!

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.790
There is no time limit.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:07.220
It doesn't matter if the
target is dead or alive.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.190
Please contact us once
you've captured one!

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.350
Two billion each?

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.200
If we catch them all, we'd have 14 billion!

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.080
It'll cost you 5 million Jenny to participate!

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.420
We're joining in, right?

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.400
Yeah...

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.450
Yeah, that's right.
I'll fax you the information.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.090
Search the Net for information.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.020
We'll pay for anything concrete.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.580
We need to hurry.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.080
There's no rush.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.850
They won't be able to catch our targets.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.130
Huh?

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.750
After all, the Mafia's having
trouble handling them.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.360
What do you mean?

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.890
This conditional auction is
nothing but a bounty hunt.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.940
In other words,

00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.490
the Mafia is admitting that, alone,
it can't capture these targets.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.730
You have a point...

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.000
They were willing to suspend
everything to track them down.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.500
I just heard that the underground
auction was attacked last night.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.480
The underground auction?!

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.260
Was it them?

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.010
That's why there's a
reward for their heads?

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.720
Yep, they must be nuts to
steal from the Mafia.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.520
And we already know who would
be crazy enough for that.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.030
The Phantom Troupe!

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.880
Oh, right...

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.920
What's Kurapika up to?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.430
Yeah, he should be in the city,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.810
but he hasn't made contact.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.790
I'll call him.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.370
He isn't answering.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.840
Is he working?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.970
Working?

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.320
I heard that he's been
working as a bodyguard.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.280
Probably for some VIP...

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.000
He's trying to track down the Scarlet Eyes,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.330
so it must be someone in the underworld.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.500
What if he was guarding that
person at the auction house,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.460
and got caught up in the attack?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.250
He wouldn't have been
caught up in the attack.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.560
If the Troupe attacked, he'd be
actively tracking them down.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:43.470
It's possible that he's already
captured two or three.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.860
I hope you're right...

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.310
Alone?

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.580
I'm impressed.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.570
Where do you want to die?

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.620
I'll humor any requests.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.720
I'd prefer a deserted wasteland,
with no one nearby.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.160
Since I'll have you screaming
at the top of your lungs.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.510
Uvogin has come to avenge his
capture and restore his pride.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.540
And Kurapika has been waiting

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.210
for the chance to exact revenge
upon the Phantom Troupe.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.500
Their battle is about to start.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:15.460
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.230
Today, we introduce Squala.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.990
One of Neon's bodyguards.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.570
He's one of Neon's bodyguards!

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.410
He can control dogs with <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:15.460
A Manipulator who
controls his pet dogs.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.300
He's a Manipulator.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.230
He's actually dating Eliza-san, Neon's maid.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.840
Meow!

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.790
Woof!

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.420
Next time: Condition x And x Condition.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.420
Explain the difference in thirty words.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.840
A condition is a rule.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.260
A condition is a covenant with yourself!
