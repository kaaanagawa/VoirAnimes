00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.500
Leol has chased Morel into
an underground church,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.720
where they will now fight one another.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.500
This ability only activates when it rains.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.070
Inamura!

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.980
Return x And x Retire

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.860
My Inamura

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.870
summons waves!

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.030
Well? Aren't my big waves rad?

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.750
I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.930
You're having trouble moving
in the water, right?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.380
You like how easily my board can maneuver?

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.190
If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.440
That's not your ability.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.120
It belongs

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.070
to my buddy!

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.710
Oh, making a boat of smoke?

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.380
So he can stand on that smoke?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.550
You think that's enough to defeat my waves?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.190
I told you, that's not your ability!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.060
This one is my own original...

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.160
Tornave!

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.220
Maelstrom!!
Tornave

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.720
The current's so strong...

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.890
I can't tell up from down.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.290
This is bad.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.570
I can't control my body at all...

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.730
I stop my opponent's
movements with a whirlpool.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.230
Here I go!

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.730
Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.760
My harpoon can match the speed of sound,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.060
and pierce a whale at the very bottom
of the ocean, even from the sky!

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.470
Take this!

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.920
He disappeared?

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.730
Impossible!

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.400
The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.380
He had no way to escape.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.690
Bastard...

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.690
How did you do it?

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.690
I simply exhaled.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.150
When it comes to lung capacity,
no one in the world beats me.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.700
He used his breath as jet propulsion
to break out of the whirlpool?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.460
Okay, it's my turn now!

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.440
It's your turn?

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.330
In this battle, you don't get a turn!

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.090
All you get to do is drown in my waves!

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.090
During this exchange, I've learned three things.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.320
First, I now know your power.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.740
Somehow, you're able to use
other people's abilities.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.980
And those earphones

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.850
have nothing to do with your power.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.210
They're either for show or for luck.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.210
Or it means someone is sending you orders.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.950
If he meant to impair his hearing
to strengthen his power,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.050
he shouldn't be able to hear me talk.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.760
What's the third thing?

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.000
Your lifespan.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.760
That Inamura ability belongs
to a Hunter named Grachan.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.870
You probably encountered and defeated
him when he was sent

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.250
to fight the Chimera Ants.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.530
I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.280
Your life ends today!

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.340
Hold on...

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.540
That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.450
I was protecting myself from humans
who were hunting me down.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.790
It was self-defense.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.780
And I didn't steal his ability.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.550
I'm just borrowing it for a bit.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.020
Just borrowing it for a bit?

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.280
That's an excuse thieves use.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.310
Well, arguing with you is pointless.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.430
I'd like to get my hands on his ability,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.070
but defeating him is more important.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.860
Right now, our top priority
is to defeat one another.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.830
I'll repeat myself...

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.400
I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.340
Big Wall!

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.710
Giant Wave
<font size="20">Big Wall</c>

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.150
I'm flooding this underground church.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.680
My wall of water's gonna suck you in!

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.180
Just try and find your way to the surface!

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.280
Now, will he make it up?

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.930
Will I smash his skull with my board?

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.010
Launch my harpoon through his gut?

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.360
Which do I choose?

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.500
Either way,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.780
if he shows his face above water, he's done.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.330
He isn't coming back up...

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.190
Has he drowned?

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.010
No,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.690
he was confident about his lung capacity.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.340
That means he can survive for
ten or twenty minutes.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.540
No, wait.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.880
It's just possible

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.150
that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.650
There you are!

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.950
Don't move!

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.170
I'll impale you with my harpoon.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.090
Bubbles on the opposite side, too?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.490
And over here!

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.920
And over there!

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.830
There are air bubbles everywhere...

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.430
I see...

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:03.060
It's possible, if he formed his smoke
into a hose with multiple branches.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.940
That way, he wouldn't give away his position.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.460
Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.200
Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.760
No, that isn't it!

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.890
The bubbles are camouflage!

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.580
Is he running?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.480
If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.710
he could swim out through the maze of
underground corridors leading down here.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.470
I can't let him escape!

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.060
I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this,
so I could take all the credit...

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.410
My head's spinning?

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.880
And my chest hurts...

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.730
Have I been poisoned?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.280
My board disappeared?

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:01.270
Is it because my physical and
mental stability are compromised?

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:04.920
Can't move...

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.410
Can't breathe...

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.220
My power stopped working,
but the water hasn't gone away?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.930
Because we're underground?

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.090
Crap...

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.240
I let him think he had the advantage
so I could turn the tables on him.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.270
But it looks as though the one
who was backed into a corner...

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.800
was me...

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.610
Am I gonna die?

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.750
Am I... Am I gonna die here?

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.510
So he was using smoke hoses

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.180
to send air bubbles everywhere.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.290
But what kind of...

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.490
poison did he use?

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.020
That was faster than I expected.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.950
The poison you've inhaled is lethal.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.530
But it's something naturally found in air.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.330
Carbon dioxide.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.270
Carbon Dioxide

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.830
Morel used his immense lung capacity

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.330
to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.330
and exhaled it with an increased
concentration of carbon dioxide.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.710
I started my attack

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.920
before you ever began.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.530
If he was telling the truth,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.850
Grachan should be getting his ability back.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.360
I have a few hours in which to move around.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.590
During that time, I must see
them with my own eyes!

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.640
I've observed Bizeff's movements
with my crystal ball.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.470
I know how to leave this area.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.040
Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.450
he can't tell anyone because
he's kept this area a secret.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.250
They are...

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.400
up above.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:48.450
I can't go any farther.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:51.560
But...

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.600
Oh? How are you feeling?

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.680
Octopus! Where am I?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.180
How long was I out?

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.610
Don't call me an octopus!

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.930
This is an underground clinic for folks
with roots in the underworld.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.670
You were out for two whole days.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.000
Two days?! I need to get going!

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.630
Hey!

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.380
You shouldn't move around!

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.880
Your wounds will reopen.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.290
I have to follow through with the plan...

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.880
Fool!

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.230
You were just on the verge of death!

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.840
You need a few days before—

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.890
Oh, you're awake?

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.520
That's great.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.420
Thanks for everything you've done.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.000
I'm checking out now.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.030
Not until you pay me.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.530
Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.780
If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.910
I don't have my wallet on me.
I'll wire it to you when I get back.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.830
I'm not stupid enough to trust
that you'll keep that promise.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.460
Until you find someone to bring
the money, you're staying here.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.880
I don't have time for that!

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.130
Give me a phone!

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.230
It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.870
Would you just shut up and go away?

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.990
Hello?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.050
Hey, it's me.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.690
Killua!

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.090
Where are you? Are you okay?

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:02.310
What happened?

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.320
I'll explain when I see you.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.310
A strong enemy gave me some trouble.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.900
I've been in the hospital.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.540
Oh...

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.950
Well, I'm glad you called.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.250
This means you're okay now, right?

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.580
Yeah, I'll be back soon.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.960
Anything happen on your side?

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.430
We've found a strong ally.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.960
He's bonding with Knuckle.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.960
We have a plan that could
defeat the King if it goes well.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.460
Oh...

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.970
We should meet, so I can hear what you think.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.450
Okay.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.420
Then, I need you to send money
to a certain bank account.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.380
If you do that, we can rendezvous today.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.360
That just leaves Palm.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.700
You haven't been able to reach her?

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.330
No.

00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.110
She's probably still in the palace...

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.120
But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's
<i>Nen</i> has already exposed her?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.380
I imagine she's in the warehouse,
beneath the palace.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.550
There are about five kilometers
of corridors surrounding it.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.530
Pitou's <i>En</i> can't reach that far.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:11.820
But since the exit is in the
palace, she can't get out.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.080
How's Knov-san doing?

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:17.640
Well...

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.340
he's probably out of this fight.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.650
But he did manage to place the exits.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.500
There's no change to our plan.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.520
Three days to go...

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.400
His wounds are already healed!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.430
No problem.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.970
Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.960
You can leave. Right now.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.700
What are you doing?

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.260
Let's go.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.010
Huh?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.700
We're gonna join my buddies.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.560
I'll introduce you.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.910
But...

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.640
Well, I won't force you.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.600
I'll just tell you this.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.580
Thank you.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.240
Uh, wait...

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:42.740
Actually...

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.230
It's okay if I come?

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.630
I mean, I'm just a...

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.380
What?

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.240
Was I the only one who thought
we were already friends?

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.220
It's really...

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.250
okay?

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.760
It isn't about what's okay.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.410
It's whether you're coming or not.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.760
I'm going! I'm going with you!

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.390
I want to make something clear.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.480
The next time something like this happens,

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.520
I won't bother thanking you.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.170
So if something happens,
and I end up helping you,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.760
you don't need to thank me.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.530
Friends are supposed to help friends.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.140
From now on, we'll be working together.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.110
So we'll be helping each other.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.790
Supporting each other isn't a big deal.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.240
It'd be lame to thank each other
for every little thing.

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.770
Yeah, this is it.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.900
This is the world I wanted.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:05.230
The world I longed for and sought...

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.160
But deep down, I thought
it was beyond my reach...

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.500
That it wasn't meant for me...
And wouldn't happen...

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.940
I'd given up on this world.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:18.520
I thought it wasn't meant to be...

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.240
Killua, I'm...

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.280
I'm so happy, I could die!

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.790
Huh? Why are you crying?

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.690
Because...

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.390
Because you're doing this for me!

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.910
Come on...

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.680
I want to make one more thing clear.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.550
The world you're stepping into is far more brutal

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.430
than the world of the Chimera Ants.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.930
They may seem similar,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.860
but there's a huge difference between
risking a life and throwing it away.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.020
People staring death in the face every day

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.410
don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.860
Only people who maintain a daily
regimen to stay in tip-top shape,

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:12.410
and can swallow just enough poison to
fall short of a lethal dose, get to survive.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.960
That's how it goes.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.310
Are you ready to join us?

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.160
How could you know

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.110
the words I most wanted to hear?

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.800
A foolish question.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.480
I see paradise before me.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.490
I'm going, no matter what it costs me.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.420
I've seen the other side...

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.800
I've made contact.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.670
I've learned it really exists...

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.050
And I can reach it!

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.530
Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.150
2-1-3, marshal.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:25.610
4-5-1, knight.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:27.390
8-7-uh...

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.100
lieutenant general!

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.230
4-3-3... 2?

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.020
My phone number!
