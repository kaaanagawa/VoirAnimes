00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
Hello? Pitou-sama?

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.440
This is Komugi.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.970
I'm fine, so don't worry.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.810
Got it...

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.790
Now, Pitou is also under my spell...

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.550
The spell of the lie that will
free Pitou from that curse.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.290
Gon...

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.340
You listened to my request.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.850
So I will be honest with you.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.440
He is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.020
already

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.690
dead.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
His soul is no longer here.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.340
There is no way to heal him.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.780
I am sorry.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.380
Huh?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.450
Why is it healing Pitou's arm?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.820
Turn Kite back to normal.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.010
Please...

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.110
After you finish what you're doing...

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.970
Anger x And x Light

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.480
The tables have been turned.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.740
Pitou believes we have recovered Komugi.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.740
The way things are looking,
that Gon boy will be killed.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.990
I am the only one who can stop Pitou.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.250
If you hand the woman over
to me, I will stop Pitou...

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.100
Get lost, scumbag!

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.770
Leave her to me.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.280
I swear upon these eyes that
I will not let them have her.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.530
Yeah, I'm counting on you.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.530
Speed of Lightning!

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.280
Gon...

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.340
Wait for me to get there!

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.860
Gon...

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.350
I'm sorry to say this,

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.360
but I must kill you.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.360
For the King.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.140
You must

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.180
kill me?

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.200
You aren't going to heal him?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.210
Then you really aren't

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.000
going to heal Kite...

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.580
Liar.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.650
What?

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.660
What is this?

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.830
I don't care

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:08.970
if this is the end...

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:45.860
So...

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.440
I'll use everything.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.290
I was right.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.970
His power is now equal

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.740
to that of the King!

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.090
I'll kill you,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.460
Pitou!

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.510
Terpsichora!

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.000
Exceed your limits,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.270
and dance!

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:50.540
I must stop him here!

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.800
It can't be!

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.550
Is he heading for the King?

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.210
Come.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.570
I don't want to destroy this place.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.320
This way.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.280
Follow me.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.570
I don't know how he did it,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.520
but he's forced his body to mature to a point

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.350
at which he's able to defeat me.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.260
First comes

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.280
rock...

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.560
Rock.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.820
Paper.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.820
Rock.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.950
Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.260
Pitou felt a sense of relief.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.400
Thank goodness...

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:39.290
This power could only be achieved through
the sacrifice of his own life energy.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.800
<i>He's prepared to never use</i> Nen <i>again.</i>

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.620
That was the resolve required
to perform this feat.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.830
An enemy blessed with immense talent

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:07.550
has been forced to exchange all
of that talent for this power.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.080
I'm so glad

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.400
I am the one

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.540
that he will kill...

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.640
Having used Speed of Lightning to race
to Gon, Killua arrived to hear...

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.940
Which one of them is doing that?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.190
Gon!

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.790
And what he found was...

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.840
A silhouette that looked nothing
like the person he'd known,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.960
swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.780
downward toward the skull
of an already-broken Pitou...

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.790
Rock.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.720
Paper.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.020
...for the final, shattering blow.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.980
Kite...

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.360
I finished the job, the way you taught me to.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.030
So...

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.270
Gon,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.390
is that you?

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.030
Killua...

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.780
Having seen Gon's appearance,
Killua immediately thought of Bisky.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.040
But he realized the difference at once.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:45.310
Bisky's appearance changed,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.850
but there wasn't a massive increase
in the aura contained within her.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.050
And in Bisky's case,

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.430
she was merely reverting to her original form.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.180
But Gon's done the opposite!

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.570
How many years?

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.400
More than ten?

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.270
Decades?

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.860
This would have been the result
of years of endless training.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.450
What price did he have to pay
to obtain so much aura?

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.050
Pitou's devotion to the King was so great

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.280
that even after death, Terpsichora clad
itself in even more powerful <i>Nen</i>,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.460
transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet
ready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey,

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.550
its sole purpose to kill Gon.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.560
In that fraction of a second,
shorter than the blink of an eye,

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.920
Killua heard Gon speak.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.060
It's okay.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.230
It doesn't hurt.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.020
I'm not trying to be tough.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.290
I'm kind of happy...

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.320
I finally

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.630
get to be the same

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.350
as Kite was then.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.040
Gon...

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.660
I feel like

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.940
I've been redeemed some.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.680
You can have my right arm.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.610
First comes rock...

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.370
Gon!

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.600
It's time for you

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.870
to sleep, too.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.740
Stop...

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.940
You can't!

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.380
If you keep using this power,

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.380
what will happen to you?

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:20.880
Rock.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:24.580
Paper.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.590
Gon!

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.550
Next time: Flash x And x Start.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.430
I never got a chance to say this, but thank you...

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.600
For everything.
