WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.650
So, then...

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.390
Where are we on the island?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.650
Let's steal an Accompany card and go.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.410
Uninvited guests?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.490
I'm getting nervous...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.220
Just so we're clear,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.280
you didn't wash up on shore, right?

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.600
After all, if you'd let the waves carry you,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.460
it would be impossible to reach this island.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.930
This guy's strong.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.230
Who are you?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.560
Are you supposed to be our tour guide?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.640
I'm one of the designers of this game.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.390
The name's Razor.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.090
I mainly handle the Emitter spells,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.740
including all movement via spells

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740
and dealing with external threats.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.000
Eliminate
Send all trespassers
on Greed Island to a
random location on
the Azian continent
[LR][SP]

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430
This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.760
Sorry, but you'll have to leave.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.140
You're more than welcome to
visit via official channels.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.880
From there, if you defeat me,
you can receive an item.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.450
Should you decide to play,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.010
we'll probably get to fight eventually.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.560
Sounds good...

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.810
We'll come back.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.770
Through the front door.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.690
Eliminate on.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.930
Hmm, those were some strong <i>Nen</i> users...

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.000
Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.160
As Gon continues to train,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.510
he discovers a hint to developing
a new technique, and that is...

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.970
First comes rock!

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.260
Rock... Paper...

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.580
Rock!

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.780
I see.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.030
Here comes the next one!

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.780
First comes rock!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.530
Rock... Paper...

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.860
Paper!

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.600
Bisky, how do I make my <i>Nen</i> fly?

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.420
Train more!

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.420
So paper is an Emitter technique?

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.570
Uh-huh.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.790
And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.170
I wanna be able to cut through rock.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.690
I understand.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.680
That's a reasonable fighting technique.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.180
But such a childish idea.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.600
You know how it takes time
to focus <i>Nen</i> in my fist?

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.180
I was trying to think of a good
way to spend that time.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.280
And when you were talking about
rock-paper-scissors, it hit me.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280
Because I like rock-paper-scissors.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.530
Trusting your instincts is important.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.560
Your gut plays a big role in
techniques that require

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.330
multiple <i>Nen</i> categories.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.150
The key is that it should feel right to you.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.130
Ah... Ahem.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.320
Well, this is all I can manage right now,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.500
but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.140
That's awesome, Killua!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.720
You're like an electric eel!

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.020
That's a horrible comparison!

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.020
<i>He can already change </i>Nen <i>into
electricity at such a young age?</i>

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.810
Frightening...

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.030
And very tragic...

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.030
His childhood must have been a living hell.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.380
It's a miracle that he can smile now.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.040
Indeed...

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.290
They make a great team.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.760
Well, let's take a break, then.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.280
It's a little early, but we can have a party.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.420
A party?

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.240
What do you boys do back home to celebrate?

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.310
Celebrate?

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.440
In the outside world, it's almost New Year's.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.250
Time flows at the same speed
inside the game as outside.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.800
Oops!

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.700
The deadline to apply for the
Hunter Exam is coming up!

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.700
And our training was just starting to get fun...

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.290
I believe you're required to apply
before the end of the year.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.130
We need to hurry.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.410
How do we get outside?

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.380
I'm guessing there are spell
cards to leave the game?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.010
In that case, let's head to Masadora.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.470
Agreed!

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.250
Well, let's find a place to have a drink.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.030
We can't... There's no time.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.270
We can ask around the stores.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.270
How to leave the island?

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.200
That'll be 3,000 Jenny.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.150
If you go about fifty kilometers west,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.410
you'll reach the island's only port.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.030
You must defeat or bribe
the chief of that port

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.290
to receive a ticket that will
transport you outside.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.540
How big of a bribe are we talking?

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.880
Depends on how the chief's feeling.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.790
Ah...

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.450
Your other option is to
use a Leave spell card,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.550
but that's a rare one.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.360
What do we do?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.680
Let's head for the port.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.140
If it's a rare card, we could buy
a bunch without finding one.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.510
True.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.820
Passage Ticket

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.220
Voilà.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.640
Well, I'll go pass the test real
quick, and then hurry back.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.410
There are monsters called Kiriko
that live beneath a cedar tree

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.450
on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.580
If you tell them you're my friend,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.210
they'll take you to the exam area.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.700
Okay.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.530
See ya.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.220
Then let's get back to training.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.010
Osu!

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.270
Welcome.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.680
Is this where I started?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.370
No, it's not...

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.460
The girl looks similar, though.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.530
Well, that's not so unusual in games.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.800
You are leaving the island, right?

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.500
Please select a destination.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.780
Do you know Dolle Harbor?

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.690
Yes, I do.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.290
Then send me there.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.120
Understood.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.240
When you leave this island,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.650
the cards in your free slots will disappear.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.990
Is that okay?

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.550
Yeah, it's fine.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.470
Then we shall await your return.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.310
I'm back in the real world now?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.830
Doesn't feel that way.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.630
Book.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.620
Oh, it doesn't work out here.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.810
Once I submit my application,
I'll head for that cedar tree.

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.960
First, I should shower and
change into fresh clothes.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.380
Okay, train while you run!

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.110
When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9
in one minute, you'll clear this stage.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.390
That hurt!

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.560
What are you doing?

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.580
Aren't you...

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.240
Your other friend isn't here?

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.210
What's that machine on your shoulder?

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.160
Did something happen?

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.590
We were fooled by the Bomber.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.480
Will you listen to my story?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.130
So he was the Bomber...

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:30.060
The others are waiting at our base for
the Bomber to disarm the bombs.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.730
They believe the terms he gave them,

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.890
even though it was probably a bluff.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.620
Can't anything be done?

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.820
If they're prepared to accept casualties...

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.890
It's impossible.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.140
The first people to attack
will be the ones who die.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.410
Who would volunteer for that role?

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.400
True...

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.030
Jispa was our group's strongest fighter,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.160
and he was defeated in an instant.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.960
At that point, our loss was assured.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.220
And allowing him to leave the game

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.590
was a fatal mistake.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.190
We indulged in a moment's victory cheer

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.960
before we could verify each
member's cards and assign roles.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.970
That's when he caught us off guard.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.470
It's embarrassing to admit,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.710
but I was so distracted,
I didn't notice him using Leave

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.840
until it was already too late.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.360
You were probably focused on
understanding his explanation.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.530
Yeah.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.640
We were thrust into that
situation with no warning.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:37.210
Given our mental state, there was
no action we could have taken.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.120
But why are you telling us this?

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.960
Because, of everyone I've met on this island,

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.680
you are the ones I believe I can most rely on.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.680
If you run into any other players,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.370
please tell them about the Bomber.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.660
Once everyone knows how his ability works,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.140
they should be able to protect themselves.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.400
And if possible, I would
like you to avenge us!

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.160
If not,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.210
could you at least promise that
you won't let him clear the game?

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:08.960
Yeah.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.400
Understood.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.970
Sorry...

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:16.450
I'll use what time I have remaining

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:19.230
to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.550
Book.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.810
Return on.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.540
Bunzen!

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.720
Just kidding...

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.170
The truth is that they were
the only players I could find

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.050
using Magnetic Force.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.550
Even a pig can climb a tree if
you give it enough praise.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.940
Every thousandth of a percent counts

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.120
<i>when it comes to deactivating someone's </i>Nen.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.380
Well, Nickes probably left to
meet with the bombers.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.200
If the mass disarmament

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.260
turns out to be a mass explosion...

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.450
I should get started.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.960
You're finally here.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.460
Now give me your ring.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.220
Jispa's dead.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.470
That's nice. Your ring.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.470
Disarm everyone's bombs first!

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.470
Hell, no.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.630
I have to enter the game with your ring,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.480
and confirm that the cards
really are all inside.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.990
I'll disarm the bombs after that.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.100
I'll give you one more chance.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.990
Hand over the ring.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.270
Sub, put it on.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.410
If you put on a second ring outside the game,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.570
you'll overwrite the data.

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.060
Now, let's head back inside together.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.010
Wait, what was your name?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.480
Migamura, Samingadura,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.530
Interaminga, Zenberarubura.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.590
Spirits of the forest,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.020
<i>remove the tainted</i> Nen <i>that resides within me.</i>

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.570
Now, then...

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.800
What horrors will come of this?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.320
I borrow power from the forest spirits,

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.620
to use my Conjurer ability

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.790
<i>to create a</i> Nen <i>beast, capable of
consuming other people's </i>Nen!

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:53.870
It's huge!

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:58.470
The Bomber's Countdown must be
a particularly strong technique.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:02.970
How'd it go?

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.460
Has he disarmed the bombs yet?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:06.320
Book.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.820
81 restricted slot card types.

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.710
They're all here, all right.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.900
We did as you requested...

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.590
Disarm the bombs!

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.370
But of course.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.770
I'm a man of my word.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.840
But first, hand over three Leave cards.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.110
Okay, we have a deal.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.880
Sub... Bara...

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.490
Let's do this.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.960
Release.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.330
I released you

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.240
from your terror.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.370
Th-That wasn't the deal...

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.290
Why should I keep a promise

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.880
I made to a bunch of scum?

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.880
Release was the signal to explode, not disarm.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.550
Leave on!

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.170
At least now, I don't have
to worry about exploding.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.940
But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies,

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.670
this thing won't disappear.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.810
I have a troublesome partner now...

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.710
Hey, stop moving!

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.630
The Bomber thinks he killed us all.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.350
I'll let him believe that...

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.840
Until I make my move!

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.470
Bisky...

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.760
I think we should drop by
their base real fast.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.450
They already ran out of time.

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.240
Besides, he didn't even
tell us exactly where it is.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.500
And even if we did know,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.240
we don't have a spell card
that could take us there.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.100
I know.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.850
But some of them might have
survived the explosion...

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.010
Doubt it.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.920
If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs
on all his targets without anyone noticing,

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.290
he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.300
However...

00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:14.400
If we continue to play this game,

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.530
we'll probably run into the Bomber.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.040
Given that, we may need
to visit their base soon.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.700
Uh-huh.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.120
We need spell cards.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.770
Let's go to Masadora and
sell our monster cards

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:28.810
to buy spell cards.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:30.280
Yeah!

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.980
Hey, Bisky...

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.560
How long do you think it'll take me
to master my special technique?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.660
You're just starting to develop your <i>Nen</i>.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.230
It's hard to predict when your
power and speed will peak.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.720
Oh...

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.430
But it shouldn't take too long

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.170
before you get the form down.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:53.280
Really? How long?

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.190
Let's see...

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.640
Hopefully, you'll have it ready
by the time Killua returns.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.450
All right!

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.340
I'll finish my technique and surprise him!

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:14.650
You two are lucky!

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:18.200
We just received a huge
shipment of spell cards.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.340
These are the spell cards they'd gathered.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.960
We bought sixty between us,
so there are lots of different types.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.460
Look.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.970
Prison
All slotted cards on target
page are immune to theft
or destruction via spell
card until removed.
(Only targets pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.780
An S-rank card...

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.670
There are only ten in the whole game!

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.200
What do you think?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.920
Should we save it?

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.470
Or use it now?

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.290
I don't know what to do!

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.020
Shh!

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.400
You're too loud...

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.730
People will get suspicious!

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.620
If only Killua were here...

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.790
I can smell Gon on you.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:02.750
I'd like to see him again...

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.990
We'll take you to the exam site.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.070
I need to zip on over and
breeze through the exam,

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.300
so I can hurry back to Gon.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.640
But the exam won't begin for a few days.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.260
Oh, right.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.570
In the meantime, you can tell
us about yourself and Gon.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.000
Okay.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.590
I'll start with the story about
when he came to visit my home.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.410
You're making steady progress.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.230
You're on track to have your
special technique ready.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.420
This is a safe place to practice.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:54.800
Since we'll be able to spot anyone
before they're in attack spell range.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.840
I can sense people watching from Masadora,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.980
just like I sensed people
watching us at the start point.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.680
But we have plenty of defense spells now.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:07.930
Well, just to be safe,

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.660
I used a Blackout Curtain card.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.940
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy.
(Does not stack when used on target already under
effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.520
But no point in worrying about spell cards.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.100
Just focus on training hard.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:19.590
Osu!

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.740
Okay, one minute's up.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.460
Next.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.810
It didn't work.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.440
I can't reach it...

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.730
That was just fine.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.970
You're in far better shape than
a Transmuter would be!

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.930
Be patient, and start by focusing
on maintaining your aura

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.680
in a sphere for extended periods of time.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.980
Osu!

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.870
The longer you can maintain the
sphere, the stronger your <i>Ten</i>.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.740
Once you've trained long enough,

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:06.470
you'll be able to maintain an aura
sphere for two to three days!

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.770
You should be able to reach that
stone before the day's out.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.900
You're right! I reached it!

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.760
That was fast!

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:24.070
<i>This proves he's been hard at work
on his</i> Ten <i>and</i> Ren <i>every day</i>.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.660
Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.530
Osu!

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.580
Gon continues to train with Bisky,
to master his special technique.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.430
Killua has temporarily left the game
to retake the Hunter Exam.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.900
The two boys are working
hard toward their goals.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.780
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.120
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:06.300
Today, we introduce the card Blackout Curtain.

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:14.910
Blackout Curtain
Block one instance of enemy Steal
or Fluoroscopy. (Does not stack
when used on target already
under effect of Blackout Curtain.)
[DEF][CONT]

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.730
With this card,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.810
other players can't see inside your binder.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.700
You can see inside my binder
whenever you want, Killua.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.460
What?!

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.930
Continue!

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.660
Next time: Strategy x And x Scheme.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.420
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Gon-kun!

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Killua-kun!

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.510
Hey, hey, hey, hey, show me what you've got!
