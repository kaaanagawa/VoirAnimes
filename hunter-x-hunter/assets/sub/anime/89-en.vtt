00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
Your technique

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.980
has two huge weaknesses!

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.990
Compassion x And x Strength

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.510
Gon has finally challenged
Knuckle to a serious fight.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.500
However, Knuckle claims that
Gon's technique has serious flaws.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.550
So, Gon...

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.300
What did you name that technique?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.010
Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.170
Ja-Janken!

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.310
Wow, zero effort...

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.050
Jajanken...

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.910
I understand.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.200
You combined "jajan" for "ta-dah," with
"janken" for your attack, "Rock-Paper-Scissors."

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.190
Ah, no...

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.080
The first "ja" was a stutter.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.620
Not a bad name, kid!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.140
Uh, yeah.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.690
Guess I'm okay with that.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.840
You are?!

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.010
Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.970
First, it takes too long to charge.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.360
During a fight, you don't have time
to stand still for several seconds.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.780
I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.240
I know that.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.860
Second, it's too risky.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.260
When you focus aura in your
fist to increase power,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.890
you have less aura for defense.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.750
One attack to the wrong place
will take you out, fool!

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.320
I know the risks.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.760
That's why I've spent the past month
training to compensate for them!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
Now that I see it again,
his aura really is something.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.150
In terms of volume, he has
as much as a mid-level pro.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.020
He's so close...

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.690
But you still lack

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.780
experience.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.730
You haven't been in

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.290
enough real fights!

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.970
You've got plenty of determination.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.130
It seems you've looked death
in the eye many times,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.300
and you have natural talent.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.230
However, you're still unrefined.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.600
Your aura is too rough!

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.490
I can tell which area you're defending.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.030
I can see what you're trying to do.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.440
Your aura gives it all away.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.490
So if I use that information to fake you out,

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.450
shifting your intended point of attack...

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.500
This is the result!

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.310
Damn...

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.350
His aura is giving away his every move!

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.610
I was right! Knuckle really is...

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.030
Okay, then...

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.110
Time to throw a real punch.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.860
He's so...

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.140
Don't blame me if you die.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.870
He's so gentle!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.480
Behind you, fool!

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.920
Without his warning, I could have died.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.970
First, it takes too long to charge.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.800
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.850
And providing guidance.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.860
He's telling me how to become stronger.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.860
He's too gentle!

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.060
First comes rock...

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.360
I told you that you won't pull off that attack.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.840
Don't fool around with me!

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.850
That was your full strength?

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.280
Which one of us is fooling around?!

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.850
It's supposed to be a serious fight!

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.360
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.700
First comes rock...

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.000
Here I go!

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.500
Rock...

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.100
Over here!

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.890
First comes rock...

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.390
Rock...

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.300
Bastard...

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.120
He faked me out with his Jajanken.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.770
It's obvious that you're focused
on stopping my special attack.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.130
Even I could tell exactly when your
right arm was going to strike.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.770
He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long
charge time, against his opponent.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.470
He's playing mind games.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.910
Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.630
He has to swing for it.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.770
It's a perfect pitch, right down the
middle, that he has to send flying.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.280
That's the trigger.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.660
When you see the easy ball, you tense up.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.410
You can hit it. You have to.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:55.910
These thoughts make you use
more strength than necessary.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.860
The same thing applies to aura.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.550
<i>If a </i>Nen <i>user doesn't control their aura,</i>

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.580
it will gather in areas of tension.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.440
The moment of the swing, it intensifies further.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.620
<i>If the</i> Nen <i>user is inexperienced or out of control, </i>

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.470
the aura will either stagnate
or just flow too freely.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.160
The flow of the aura

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.310
lets the opponent sense
when an attack will come.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.820
You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.820
By calling him out for being soft,
Gon threw Knuckle off.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.320
As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.690
I'd think this tactic would be more effective
on those who know Jajanken's strength.

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.920
Opponents who have seen how
strong the technique can be

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.180
will be more scared and likely to lose
control when they see it coming.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.380
The fake-out will be more believable,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.740
and if the enemy steps back,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.230
they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.470
I always assumed Jajanken

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.830
would be less useful once opponents
figured out how it works.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.080
That it was flawed.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.300
But I was wrong.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.060
It can be adapted to any situation.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.360
Okay, let's try this again.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.400
In the second attempt, he was
too focused on the technique

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.340
and let Knuckle land a kick on him.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.140
But if he learns to better control his aura
in response to the opponent's movement,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.970
it will be harder to distinguish between

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.500
fake and real Jajanken attempts.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.260
Gon's been thinking how to shore
up his technique's weaknesses.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.630
No...

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.450
He thought of the solution during this fight.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.520
He's making incredible progress while fighting.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.740
I'm already getting tired.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.690
We haven't even been
fighting for twenty minutes.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.800
Moving so much is sapping my energy.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.790
If an hour of training is comparable
to ten minutes of fighting,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.170
<i>I'll only be able to maintain my </i>Ken <i>for another ten minutes.</i>

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.890
If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.170
Before then, I have to end this.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.680
By using Jajanken.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.810
Bring it!

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.680
Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.950
But Gon is adapting, little by little.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.430
By increasing the area his aura covers,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.590
he reduces the damage from miscalculations.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.680
And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.620
Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.460
But he's running out of time.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.970
He doesn't have much stamina
left to maintain his aura.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.390
On the other hand, Knuckle has
been conserving his strength,

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.480
only attacking with physical blows.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.600
Jajanken requires a large
amount of aura just to charge.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.990
A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.670
Gon's already activated his technique three times.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.960
They started fighting twenty minutes ago.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.300
If he uses Jajanken again,
he'll only have a minute or two

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.160
to fight at full strength.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.540
Gon...

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.980
You told me to use my full strength,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.110
but you're no match for me right now.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.690
You're...

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.360
First comes

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.700
rock...

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.200
Why?

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.020
What...

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.960
is he going to do?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.500
First comes

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.600
rock...

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.670
Why?

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.480
Knuckle's in good shape and alert,
and he's attacking from that distance?

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.980
He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.190
This is definitely Gon's final attack.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.370
This will end it.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.040
Rock... Scissors...

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.370
Paper!

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.050
An Emitter attack?

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.140
But it's much weaker than his Rock.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.390
You're definitely an Enhancer.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.020
Your power as an Emitter is far lower.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.050
No speed... No punch.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.900
He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.150
Once I knock that aside, it's over!

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.740
Once again!

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.870
Once again?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.370
He used that ball as cover
to move behind me?

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.000
Crap!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.350
Two Jajankens in a row...

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.880
Rock!

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.340
He must have depleted his
aura before Rock hit.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.720
Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground...

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.310
Where are you going, fool?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.240
I'm going back.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.220
Aren't you going to fight?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.560
I'm fine here.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.810
You can fight Gon again tomorrow.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.810
The outcome will probably be different.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.660
I'll defeat Shoot.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.430
Tell Gon this.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.940
Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.080
He'd better be prepared to die.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.610
It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.590
Sure you're up to the task?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.910
Hell, yeah, fool.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.050
Tomorrow...

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.420
As long as you win,

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.900
it's fine if you don't get serious.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.310
But if you lose without fighting at full strength,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.100
I won't forgive you.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.010
I'll never forgive you, as long as I live.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.260
You're still soft.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.940
Why are you helping the enemy?

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.880
And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well...

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.140
If you don't want to go to NGL,
hand over your token to them.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.930
Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.800
Bastard...

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.620
You're pretty cocky when you aren't
shaking in your boots, eh?

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:06.490
The past month, all you've done is stalk them!

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.900
I'll fight.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.860
Tomorrow, I'll join the fight.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.370
Don't worry.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:28.780
I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.750
in top condition tomorrow.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.540
Killua's the real issue...

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.920
I wasn't expecting him to go

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.870
the whole month without fighting once.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:42.260
Killua!

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.820
Fight me.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.150
Huh?

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.330
What happened to your face, Killua?!

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.080
Huh? I was training with Bisky.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.860
Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.900
Anyway, are you feeling okay?

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.220
Yep, I feel great.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:16.060
I used up all my aura, so I expected
to be tired, but look!

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.040
That gorill—

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.310
That old hag's massage must have done the trick.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.730
That was close.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.200
Listen now...

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.470
If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.610
I'll make your face three times worse.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.240
She wasn't joking.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.650
Now, do you know your weakness?

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.750
You're too quick to give up.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.790
You're too cautious about fighting.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.380
Some might say you underestimate yourself.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.960
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.880
you fight on the premise of escaping.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.090
I realize that this isn't your fault.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.720
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.470
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.050
But I can say one thing for sure.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.050
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:43.360
Combat ability can change,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.560
depending on environment
and physical condition.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.620
For example, a good-condition C

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.190
has a high chance of defeating
a poor-condition D.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.950
If the conditions are right, A, B, and C

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.920
all have the potential to defeat D.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.700
But in your case, you're assuming

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.970
the enemy is always at their best.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:08.260
You always assume the worst-case scenario.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.770
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.800
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.210
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.730
You don't bother to think of how you could win.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.530
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.070
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:39.740
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.540
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.350
you must leave Gon's side.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.760
Okay! I'm gonna win this time!

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.880
Let's go.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.530
Yeah.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:30.330
Killua's overly cautious style is the
product of a smothering love.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.720
A twisted, self-serving love...

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.320
That just makes his habits stronger,
deeper, and harder to break.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.950
Without extraordinary willpower,
this curse cannot be broken.

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:06.230
I don't know who will emerge victorious...

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.330
All right, then...

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:12.730
Time to run for it.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.030
The loser...

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.920
Hands his token to the winner.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.800
Gon and Knuckle.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.270
Killua and Shoot.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.480
Their final battle begins.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.760
Next time: Interest x And x Curse.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.240
Who are you calling slow, fool?

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.140
Are you saying I'm cursed, fool?
