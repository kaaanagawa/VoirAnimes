WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Wait...

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.690
By using...

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.570
words?

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.100
King...

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.410
Would you like to know your name?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.620
How would you know my name?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.800
My subordinates were present at the
moment of your mother's passing.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.010
She uttered your name with her dying breath.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.340
And my subordinates may have died
fighting your Royal Guard by now.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.380
Interested in fighting me now?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.720
If you can force me to admit defeat,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.240
I will tell you your name.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.310
Force you to admit defeat without killing you?

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.060
So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.770
No matter.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.040
I shall checkmate you shortly.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.980
Centipede x And x Memory

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.020
As the King and Netero prepared
for their final battle...

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.030
Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.960
having failed to finish off
the unconscious Brovada.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.030
Fire! This is the best option!

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.180
There's no one else to help me!

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.590
I h-have to...

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.840
kill him!

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.600
This is no time to be crying...

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.680
I have to find Palm!

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.810
Huh?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.370
The door to the warehouse area is open.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.570
So is the door leading to the garage!

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.150
Why?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.530
Don't move!

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.830
If you move, I'll attack.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.580
Welfin...

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.840
I have a lot of things to ask you.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.840
If you seem to be trying anything funny,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.430
I'll kill you!

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.440
What he wants to ask me

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.050
is obvious!

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.450
The number of my allies,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.960
their roles,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.100
and their abilities.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.360
And he intends to use any means
necessary to get the answers.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.490
People could die if I leak information.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.350
If he's a Manipulator,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.780
he can obtain the information against my will.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.580
Huh?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.250
D-Don't move!

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.500
I really will kill you!

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.420
Go ahead... Kill me.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.250
That's what I want!

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.750
Stop!

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.760
If the alternative is betraying my buddies,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.210
I'll take you with me!

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.570
Ouch!

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.890
Bastard! Now you've done it!

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.890
Damn it!

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.360
I'll kill you!

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.760
Missile Man!

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.530
I'm... not dead...

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.930
I didn't sustain any damage.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.950
What was that attack?

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.200
Damn, that hurts...

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.420
You little punk...

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.960
Damn...

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.210
That bastard... How did a wimp like
that figure out my weakness?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.620
Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.860
If an enemy attacks before I can ask
a question, it's null and void!

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.110
The wound isn't deep...

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.530
I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.850
Huh?

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.750
He planted something inside me?

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.830
Those were created by my <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.630
They're black centipedes.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.630
Black Centipede

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.140
They grow by feeding on your resistance.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:28.450
If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.910
you'll suffer excruciating pain,

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.570
then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.950
Wh-What are you doing, fool?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.900
Weren't you listening to me?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.240
If you try to do that...

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.790
That's fine with me.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.100
If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.570
S-Stop!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.830
No, wait...

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.860
If he wanted to kill me, that's the
ultimate form of resistance.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.850
Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes
to grow large enough to kill him instantly!

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.260
Don't worry.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.260
I'm not interested in killing you...

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.490
I just need to make sure that you can't leave.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.480
I still...

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.110
have plenty of bullets.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.870
Bastard! Don't mess with me!

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.620
I'll kill you!

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.020
You're dead! I'll kill you!

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.710
It's so easy.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.660
When I'm prepared to offer my own life,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.480
it's so easy to pull the trigger.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.000
I g-get it...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.080
I get it, already.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.540
I won't go anywhere!

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.260
I surrender.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.300
Please... Don't fire!

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.440
The pain is going away.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.570
The creatures inside me are suffering?

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.810
I lose, damn it...

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.310
I can't move anymore.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.910
Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.760
Man, I knew it...

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.780
I had a feeling this would happen eventually.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.350
But still...

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.740
I didn't think I was this weak!

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.480
I didn't think it'd be so scary
to face someone who fights

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.970
with no regard for their own life!

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.310
Hey.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.620
What?

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.850
The pain has stopped, but can
you get rid of these bugs?

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.800
Stop complaining...

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.970
I'm in too much pain to think about that now!

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.340
Hurry up.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.870
Give me a minute!

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.990
I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.050
But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble...

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.130
Damn, how do I get out of this?

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:01.480
I need to buy time...

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.300
Until I can come up with a good idea.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.830
The pain is making me...

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.850
feel faint...

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.370
Wait! Okay!

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.470
I was lying! I won't do it again!

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.540
Then get rid of these.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.900
Yeah, uh...

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.430
So, the thing is...

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.270
Forget it. I see how it is.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.310
Wait! Hold on!

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.900
I can't remove them!

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.570
Not once they've been activated!

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.490
That's why I didn't want to say anything.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.010
It's the truth! Believe me!

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.830
I'm not trying to trick you!

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.440
The insects are in pain again.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.380
Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.790
Can you really blame me?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.030
I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.840
I never cared what happened after that.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.350
I never gave any thought to
what happened to my enemy.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.680
<i>Nen</i> abilities are really something.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.610
My abilities reflect my own personality.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.760
My personality? His true intentions?

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.220
Welfin...

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.570
What do I ask him?

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.800
What do I want to know?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.470
I once knew someone just like him.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.090
Do you have any memories from
when you were human?

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.600
Wh-Why are you asking about that?

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.790
I can't remember...

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:18.150
You're lying.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.470
Wh-What?

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.240
Stop! Hold on!

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.030
Calm down!

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.710
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.440
When I woke up,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.520
my first thought was...

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.900
Damn...

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.600
I can still remember it.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.760
I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:24.780
I was fed to the Queen,
and reborn as something new...

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.840
But I still...

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.970
I still remember the one thing
I most wanted to forget.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.280
The sight of my father strangling me,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.040
and the woman watching behind him.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.500
At first, I only had flashbacks of it.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.370
Over time, I remembered the
entire sequence of events.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.130
I was saved by...

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.990
my little brother, who was unrelated by blood.

00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.140
I remember now!

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.260
He looked just like Gyro!

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.530
Gyro?

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:24.520
You know. The king!

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.600
We used to brag about whose
life was more miserable.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.810
He was the only one I could
turn to when I needed

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.540
to laugh away my tears...

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.810
We were both empty.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.470
So we had nothing to hide.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.730
I wonder what he's doing now...

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.570
I want to see him one more time...

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.560
Yes, I just want to see Gyro.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.250
I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.730
with money and nations...

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:50.200
Go.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.540
The bugs are gone.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.610
You still have something to do.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.620
Why did you open the doors?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:08.380
Oh, I was letting those weaklings
reach the treasure in the back.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.600
They can't put up much of a fight.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.310
I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.890
And I told them to pass while
you were on the way back.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.630
A coward!

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.280
It was that simple.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.910
Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.920
I thought you'd be an easy target.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.890
I couldn't have been more wrong.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.140
Go on.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.260
I'm too tired to move...

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.420
I have one last question.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.930
Did you see a woman in the palace?

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.420
A woman?

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.350
Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.840
but the Royal Guard captured a human,
and put her in a cocoon.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.950
Where is she?

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.410
Take the elevator up, then turn left.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.450
It's the room at the end of the hall.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.690
They called it #1.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.120
Thank you!

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.960
What's so funny?

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.220
Telling the truth

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.930
feels really good...

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.990
Welfin had spent his life unable
to trust himself or others.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:02.820
Telling Ikalgo the location of
the one he searched for

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.950
was the first time he'd opened
up and spoken honestly.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.840
Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:26.970
I'm just... I'm just...

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.670
What's wrong, Killua?

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:29.890
I'm here for you.
