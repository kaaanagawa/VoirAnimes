00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
Then x And x After

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
"Dear Mito-san and Grandma,
how are you doing?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.500
I'm doing great, as always.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.320
So, I actually passed the Hunter Exam.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.130
While I managed to pass the exam,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.810
I'm not too happy about it.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.220
That's because of what happened
during the Final Phase."

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.680
You really don't get it...

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.230
If you die, you'll never get another chance.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.450
If I kill you here,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.820
I need only try again next year.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.610
We are not on equal footing!

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.120
You value your pride more
than your own life?!

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.000
You're really willing to die for your pride?!

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.960
I'm going to find my dad.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.490
My dad is a Hunter.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.590
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.970
I believe that I'll find him one day...

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.450
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.490
I'll never find him!

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.460
So I won't surrender.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.990
If you don't yield, you'll die...

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.410
He defies reason.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.920
I give up. You win.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.800
That's not fair!

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.050
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.810
You fool!

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.060
"He knocked me out.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.810
So Satotz-san had to tell me

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.730
what had happened next."

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.900
Begin!

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.570
It's been too long, Kil.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.390
Brother...

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.360
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.720
You were born to be...

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.370
a killer.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.280
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.310
True,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.160
I don't desire to become a Hunter.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.520
But...

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.670
I do have something I want...

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.750
You don't.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.890
I do!

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.010
There's something I really want!

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.550
Tell me what it is that you want.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.020
I want to become friends with Gon...

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.800
I'm sick of killing people...

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.670
I want to become friends with Gon,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.190
and to live a normal life...

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.080
That's impossible.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.620
You'll never be able to make friends.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.500
Because you have the soul of a killer.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.760
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.130
And if our bodies make contact,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.520
that will also mean the fight has begun.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.100
If you don't fight me,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.230
your dear Gon will die.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.550
I surrender.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.370
I lose...

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.760
"Killua gave in to his despair after that."

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.060
Apologize to Killua!

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.950
Apologize? For what?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.200
You don't know what you did wrong?

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.000
Don't bother apologizing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.880
Just take me to see Killua.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.530
What will you do then?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.560
That should be obvious...

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.960
I'm gonna rescue Killua!

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.160
"After that, Kurapika, Leorio, and I

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.120
went to Kukuroo Mountain,
where Killua lives."

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.730
This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.080
Anyone who cannot open this gate

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.330
is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.590
Listen to me, Gon-kun.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.550
You three are allowed to work together

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.350
to open the door.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.600
With a little training, it should be possible.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.480
Let's do this, Kurapika!

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.940
Right, let's push!

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.280
Here we go!

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.280
One!

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.280
Two!

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.150
Three!

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.140
Ow...

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.660
It opened.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.410
Yes!

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.140
We did it, Gon!

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.430
Uh-huh!

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.680
Leave.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.440
You're trespassing on private property.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.940
I cannot allow you to pass
without permission.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.510
If you take one step beyond this line,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.940
I'll remove you by force.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.200
What's the problem?

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.950
I'm just here to see my friend.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.960
I'm just here to see Killua!

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.500
Why do I have to do this?!

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.140
You're different from Mike.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.400
You may try to hide your feelings,

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.890
but you have a heart.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.270
When I mentioned Killua,
your eyes softened for a moment.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.660
Please...

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.580
Help Killua-sama—

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.310
You must be Gon.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.890
I heard about you from Illumi.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.640
Killua knows that you're here.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.020
Why can't Killua come see us?

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.520
Because he's in solitary confinement.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.820
Solitary confinement?

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.070
Kil returned because he regretted his actions.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.610
And he voluntarily entered
solitary confinement.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.830
I will take you

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.830
to the butler's office.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.070
There is a phone that connects to the mansion.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.980
If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.560
Well? Which hand?

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.800
I have known Killua-sama his entire life.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.060
I dare say that I care for him
as though he were my own.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.980
In all honesty,

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.940
I must despise you for trying
to take him away.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.000
If one of you answers incorrectly,
that person is out of the games.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.710
Should you all be disqualified,

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.800
I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.590
And that he will never see you again.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.480
Here I go.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.550
One second!

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:42.540
What is it?

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.390
If you're trying to buy time,
I'll kill one of your friends.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.230
That's it...

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.020
He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.610
Okay!

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:59.770
Now I can see.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.910
Give me your best!

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.380
Who now holds the coin?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.960
The person right behind me.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.450
Brilliant.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.270
Gotoh, is Gon here yet?

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.290
Killua!

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.460
Oh! You're here, Gon!

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.080
Along with...

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:35.990
Kurapika?

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.510
I'm just an afterthought?

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.660
Liorio!

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.240
Leorio!

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.220
It's been a while.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.490
I can't believe you came.
What happened?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.790
Your face is a wreck!

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.910
Yours isn't any better!

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.540
"And just like that,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.290
we managed to rescue Killua.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.540
However, there is one more piece

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.350
of business I must take care of, Mito-san."

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:16.150
Hunter Vocabulary

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.150
Alphabet

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.740
"The business I still need to take care of

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.800
is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase."

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.710
I will need you to draw lots.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.270
Lots?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.460
For what?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.220
To determine who will hunt
and who will be hunted.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.720
Listen carefully!

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.220
Your target's ID tag is worth three points.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.980
Your own ID is also worth three points.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.730
All other ID tags are worth one point.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.860
You need six points to advance
to the Final Phase.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.860
So while on Zevil Island,

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.640
you must gather enough ID tags
to total six points.

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.880
That is the condition for clearing
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.340
What number did you draw?

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.490
Show each other our numbers
at the same time?

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:28.850
Okay!

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.850
Ready, and...

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.340
#44 is...

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.360
Seriously?

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.740
In a straight-up fight,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.110
I wouldn't stand a chance.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.800
But if I only need to steal his ID tag,

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.810
then I have a real shot.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.290
Yeah.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.590
I might actually have a chance.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.800
That scares me a little...

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.200
But I think it's worth it.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:23.610
Now!

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.460
I did it!

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.580
I figured it out!

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:35.590
I have to aim for my target as
he hunts his own prey!

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.960
There!

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.460
At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
in the next minute.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.750
I have to figure out where
their paths will cross...

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.030
Over there!

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.780
I've gotta hurry.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.790
Hisoka will attack,

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.850
as soon as he notices that guy.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.600
This is my chance to steal his tag...

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.510
My last chance!

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.130
I have to conceal my presence, too.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.380
Completely conceal my...

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:12.970
presence.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.280
Here he comes!

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.530
Hisoka!

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.780
Damn... Bring it!

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.300
I did it...

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.500
I took Hisoka's tag!

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.720
Approximately, seven thousand.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.220
Do you know what that
number represents?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.730
The number of chances
I had to kill you.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.910
It's also the number of times you swung

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.700
your fishing rod when you were training.

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.490
Next time, remember to
watch your own back.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.560
So long.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.840
Damn it...

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.680
You surprise me.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.010
You hid your presence,
while waiting for your chance?

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.690
Waiting for me to attack another?

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.800
Did you teach yourself how
to conceal your presence?

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.370
Marvelous...

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.560
Like a wild animal.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.440
And your timing was impeccable.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.040
You concealed all traces of your attack

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.960
by timing it with my own attack.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.030
A splendid job.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.440
Wait...

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:02.220
Didn't you come to take back your tag?

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.220
No, I just came to commend you.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.020
You owe me one now.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.310
Feel free to pay me back when you want.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.710
Goodbye.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.160
I don't want to owe anyone...

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.080
You can have it back now.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.210
I refuse.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.210
Right now, I'm letting you live.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.720
And I'll continue to keep you alive,

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.720
until you've grown enough
to be worth killing...

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.660
I'll only take it back

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.490
when you're able to punch me
in the face, just like that.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.490
Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.740
"It's the first time I've ever
felt that frustrated.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.070
So I need to find a way to return the favor.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:19.450
I can't return to Whale Island
until that's done.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.890
That's why I'll be going to
Heavens Arena with Killua,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.640
to train as a Hunter.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.870
Please take care until I get back.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.900
Gon Freecss."

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.440
I didn't expect him home anytime soon.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.800
He really is your son...

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.080
Are you watching over him,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.200
Ging?

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.840
Next time: Arrival x At The x Arena!

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.010
Off we go!

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:28.930
Gon Gon!

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.290
Again?
