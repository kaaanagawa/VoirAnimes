WEBVTT

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.250
While Killua returned to the Zoldyck
compound for a reunion with Alluka,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.010
who was locked up deep underground...

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.250
I'd say there were six other cases
in which two people died...

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.470
Our mother didn't believe Killua,
so that was another pair.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
Another pair died to satisfy her curiosity.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.990
Even after she was convinced,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.010
she sacrificed two more pairs to verify
how the other victims were chosen.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.370
Then Milluki

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.140
exchanged the lives of two pairs
of tourists for some cheap toys.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.370
During that time, there were two major incidents.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.730
There were thirteen confirmed deaths in
the first, and sixty-seven in the second.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150
Kill him for me.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.410
Milluki was responsible for the first one.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.460
I want to be a millionaire.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.670
Yasuha, the butler, was
responsible for the second.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Alluka x And x Something

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.810
Sure, a few pictures are no problem, Muna-san.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.420
I'm just taking Alluka and Kalluto for a walk.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.290
Oh, they're my younger brothers.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.740
Incredible!

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.000
Hey, Muna...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.590
Eat this.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.040
Hmm?

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.480
Huh?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.880
Oh, sorry...

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.960
He likes to make requests.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.910
You only need to refuse.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.760
Kill him for me.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.150
Figuring out the tourist incident wasn't easy...

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.820
But since another butler paid the
price for the butler's incident,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.200
it was easy to track down the victims.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.640
After investigating, I realized something.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.400
The criteria that determines who dies

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.520
is different for more than two people.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.540
Perhaps there are different
rules for when a pair dies,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.090
and when many people die.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.520
Zoldyck butlers are trained in
a facility on our property.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.610
At the exact moment Kasuga died,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.060
every butler in her class at that
facility was wrung to death.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.190
Her head teacher and specialized teachers also died.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.760
Butlers from other classes...

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.780
Friends from her orphanage...

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.780
Her foster parents and their parents...

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.130
All people she was close to.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.640
Still, that she liked all of her
classmates was impossible, right?

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.890
It becomes clear when you look at her
hospitalized biological mother.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.670
Every month, she could only meet
her mother for half an hour.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.620
Records from Kasuga's student days say she
loved her mother most in the world.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.330
But her mother, in the hospital, survived.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.050
Well, people change...

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.800
Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.260
I agree, but that wasn't the case here.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.630
It wasn't that she began to hate her mother.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.450
Rather, she found someone she loved more.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.560
Kasuga had just begun a relationship.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.500
She'd spent even less time with her lover
than she had with her mother.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.420
But wait...

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.120
You didn't investigate her past after the fact.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.820
You chose her to test after learning her past.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.570
Oh, you could tell?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.580
Yeah, that's right.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.060
We used her to confirm our suspicions.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.460
Since our butlers aren't allowed to
have relationships, or they're killed.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.880
The first incident made it clear
that this power was dangerous.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.310
Capable of destroying the Zoldyck
family, if we didn't understand it.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.990
After investigating the first incident
and reaching a conclusion,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.610
the second incident confirmed it.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.370
If you fail to grant four of Alluka's requests,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.350
you must pay with your life.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.370
When the price is two lives,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.250
you and the person you love most will die.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.370
When more than two must be sacrificed,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.880
you and the person you love most will die,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.730
along with, in order, those you've
spent the most time with.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.310
So Kasuga's mother didn't die because she
hadn't spent enough time with her.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.540
And Kasuga's lover died,
despite his short time with her.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.110
This is a problem.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.600
Isn't it?

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.340
Killua will make a wish to Alluka, to restore Gon.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.490
If Killua makes the wish

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.000
and lets someone else fulfill the requests,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.620
there shouldn't be any problem.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.280
But I'm sure Killua will do things
the other way around.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.640
Brother!

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.680
Alluka...

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.290
Killua will have someone else make the wish,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.180
and will then attempt to fulfill the
consequent requests himself.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.470
Sorry about leaving you down
here for so long, Alluka.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.660
I'm sorry.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.550
It's okay! I'm really happy!

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.550
I've missed your scent...

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.300
The leader of the monsters was strong enough
to force Netero to resort to the Rose.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.230
To defeat one of its subordinates,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.680
Gon's restriction and covenant must
have been harder on him than death.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.680
Restriction                                                                      Covenant

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:21.130
A wish to reverse that would far exceed
the power of money and medical science.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.280
The wish will likely be granted.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.070
And then, Killua will do whatever
he can to fulfill Alluka's requests.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.360
Killua will receive requests he cannot fulfill.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.290
Still, Killua will try his best, and fail halfway.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.830
Mission failed.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.590
The one he loves most, or the
one he's spent most time with...

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.340
Either way,

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.600
the restored Gon will still die.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.300
Huh?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.660
Huh?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.520
Oh.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.600
Am I wrong?

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:07.160
When you mentioned that "both" would die,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.130
were you referring not to Killua and Gon,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.860
but to Killua and yourself?

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.370
Yes, that's right.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.370
I have issues, but you are just as bad.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.960
And if things go wrong,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.580
it won't only be Killua, Gon, and me.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.510
Every Zoldyck will die.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:36.330
I'm thinking that this wish will cost
tens of thousands of lives.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.750
So you'll probably die, too.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.020
That's why your comment surprised me.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.030
Oh, this is a problem...

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.040
Brother, die.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.090
Okay, sure.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.550
Bang!

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.500
I'll ask Killua to follow proper procedure
when he makes his wish.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.010
I want you there, hidden.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:26.750
If Killua either refuses,
or agrees, but you feel he's lying,

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.280
I want you to dispose of Alluka.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.880
He has no combat abilities.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.610
You can consider him an ordinary child.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.460
We just don't know where he came from.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.880
Third Election for the 13th Chairman
1) Pariston — 258 (39%)
2) Cheadle — 49
3) Botobai — 31
4) Ickshonpe — 28
5) Mizaistom — 27

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.300
6) Morel — 18
7) Teradein — 17
8) Saccho — 15
9) Sanbica, Bushidora — 14
11) Loupe — 11
12) Cutie, Biscuit, Linne — 10
15) Tsezguerra — 9
16) Knov, Kanzai — 6
18) Kite, Satotz — 4
20) Menchi, 6 others — 3
27) Saiyu, 3 others — 2
31) Gon, Hanzo, 21 others — 1

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.660
There were 68 absentees.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.800
Absentees — 68              Turnout — 89.7%

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.800
The turnout was 89.7%.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.370
Oh, dear... Oh, dear... Oh, dear.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.310
This is strange.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.260
In the second vote, there were
thirty-three absentees.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.840
This time, we have sixty-eight absentees.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.940
More Hunters were absent.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:16.390
Is this because they previously
submitted invalid votes,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.460
which is no longer possible?

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.450
So they chose to put their licenses
on the line by not voting at all?

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.240
What's going on?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.460
Why would they go that far?!

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.080
Then it's okay if we take licenses

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.960
from anyone who's committed both offenses?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.380
Yes, I suppose we have no choice.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.220
Cluck-san, this is the list.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.920
Please send them a letter
that says these two things:

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.080
They must bring their licenses to headquarters.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.270
And that we expect them to explain their absences.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.420
I don't know...

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.240
Will that really be enough?

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.790
Once they lose their licenses,
violators gain exemption from the rules.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:10.630
They no longer need to fear
the penalty for not voting.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.880
Taking away their licenses was your idea!

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.900
Huh? But we put the proposal to a vote.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.480
Besides, everyone was against the idea

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.140
of temporarily stripping them of Hunter status.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.930
If my goal had been to quickly improve turnout,

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.650
then I would have agreed.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.750
Yes, he's hard to deal with

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.460
because he readily accepts
suggestions that hurt him.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.660
And he'll even propose ideas
disadvantageous to him.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.310
It's as though he enjoys the obstacles.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.310
That's the one aspect that's
similar to Chairman Netero.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.570
And I don't like it!

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.970
So I have a proposal.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.010
I think the twelve Zodiacs should give a speech

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:06.470
before all of the Hunters.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.180
We must express this election's importance!

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.690
For the Association...

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.130
For humanity...

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.000
For the world!

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.290
Speaking through a screen is no good.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.160
We must look each of them in the eye,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.010
and let them hear our voices,
and feel our souls in person.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.660
For the sake of the former chairman!

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.150
This is why

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:32.500
I hate your guts, Pariston!

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.510
Brother, wake up!

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.120
Boo!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.400
You're so good!

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.020
Alluka's power has rules the rest of
the family doesn't know about.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.440
Brother, let's play shiritori.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.910
Okay, sure.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.030
Then...

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.120
I'll start with the ending "A" in "Alluka"!

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.840
The one that calls me "Brother" is the real Alluka.

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.520
The one that calls me "Killua"

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.560
is something else.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.560
Brother, pat my head.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.970
Sure.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.130
Killua's being a model big brother.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.500
That's three requests down.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.190
So a computer was no big deal...

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.790
S-S-Sorry, Papa...

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.480
I won't do it again!

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.490
That means Alluka is ready.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.480
Yep, Killua just has to make his wish.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.290
Milluki, I want you to go over the rules again.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.750
Ah, sure.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.750
I'm aware of five rules.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.250
One.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.460
When someone fails to fulfill one of
Alluka's requests, causing them to reset,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.850
the request difficulty returns to level 1.

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.750
That's the best time to make a wish to Alluka.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.800
Two.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.830
Once Alluka starts making requests to someone,

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.830
he will not switch his requests
to someone different.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.850
That's why I always ensured
that Alluka made a request

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.660
to a butler before sending
him to you and Mama.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.280
I'd guess Killua did the same thing.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.750
That's why Alluka has never made
any requests of you two.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.760
Three.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.340
If the person receiving Alluka's requests
dies before clearing them all,

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.300
it's considered a failure,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.120
and at least one more will die.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.400
This was confirmed by experiment.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.110
Four.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.310
If he doesn't know someone's name,
Alluka can't make requests of them.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.940
Five.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.940
The same person can't make two wishes in a row.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.470
That's all I know.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.630
I'm not hiding anything from you!

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.230
I swear on the deal we made.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.210
Why isn't Killua making a wish?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.210
He probably has some foolish idea...

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.330
If Killua makes a wish now,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:13.720
someone else will have to clean up the mess.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.200
That makes no sense.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.490
Can he not save his friend first,

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.730
and worry about the consequences later?

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.790
Papa...

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.280
Would his friend be happy to know

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.210
that many lives were sacrificed to save him?

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.490
No!

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.530
That's what's going through his head.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.990
Since he's stupid.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.420
His mind doesn't work the way ours do.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.000
That's why you had Illu-nii use
his needles on him, right?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.690
He's moving.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.690
Father, open the door.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.440
No.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.530
Make the wish in that room.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.410
We cannot let you go outside.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.000
As I thought.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.540
They don't know about any of these rules.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.670
Father,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.880
I am definitely your son.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.560
You called Alluka "something that
came from somewhere else."

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:41.760
Right?

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.600
I call the black-eyed Alluka "Something," too.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.610
We're leaving.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.230
I'll clean up my own mess.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.330
Something,

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.310
if we haven't left the mountain in half an hour,

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.840
kill my mother!

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.850
Huh? Hey, Killua!

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.850
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.220
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.970
Got it?

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.860
'Kay.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.370
Mama!

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.960
Killua...

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.890
How...

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.390
How can you issue such cruel commands?

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.060
It's magnificent! You've grown up!

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.390
Damn! You're allowed to do that?

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:12.400
As long as only one wish is granted,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.770
you can give yourself options!

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.350
Father,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.480
open the door.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.230
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.760
When she's fixing,

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.110
she must touch the target,
or her power won't work.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:42.070
If we've left the mountain in half an hour,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.040
I want you to kiss me on the cheek.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.760
I will save both Gon and Alluka!

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:25.010
Killua's determination to save Gon
has set events in motion.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.760
And that man returns.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.070
