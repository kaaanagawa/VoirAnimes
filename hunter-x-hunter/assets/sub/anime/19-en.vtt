00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.800
What?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.050
Are you serious about this?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.030
Dead serious.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.340
Those who win will join
the ranks of the Hunters.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.810
Can't Win x And x Can't Lose

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.820
Nine applicants:

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.070
Gon, Killua, Kurapika,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.200
Leorio, Pokkle, Bodoro,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.210
Gittarackur, Hanzo, and Hisoka,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.240
head to the Final Phase, having passed
the exam's Fourth Phase.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.040
Well, gentlemen.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.210
Did you get plenty of rest?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.390
This hotel is owned by the
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.220
The place is all yours until the
battles have concluded.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.110
For the Final Phase, we will be
holding a one-on-one tournament.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.630
So only the last person standing passes?

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.360
No.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.120
One win is all you need to pass.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.580
One win?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.870
Then, in this tournament...

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.430
The winners are removed from competition,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.810
while the losers continue up the bracket.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.620
In other words, the person who
finishes at the top will not pass.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.260
Does everyone understand now?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.510
So you're saying that only
one person will fail.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.300
Exactly.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.360
And here is the bracket.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.130
Impressive, right?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.850
After all, everyone has at least
two chances to win.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.380
But some people,

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.190
like #294 and #405, get five chances.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.200
Why didn't you use a balanced bracket?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.700
A question that must be on everyone's mind.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.060
This bracket was assembled
based on your performances

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.080
throughout the entire exam.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.460
Those who performed better
received more chances.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.710
That doesn't sound right.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.210
Can you explain how you
scored our performances?

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.670
No!

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.220
Why not?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.820
Your scores are classified information.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.060
So I can't tell you everything.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.730
But I can explain our methods.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.000
First, we consider three major criteria:

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.330
physical strength, mental strength,

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.700
and overall impression.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.000
For physical strength, we use
an aggregate of agility,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.210
flexibility, endurance, and perception.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.800
For mental strength, we use
an aggregate of resilience,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.300
adaptability, judgment, and creativity.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.010
However, this information is only
used as a reference point.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.830
After all, you were strong enough

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.050
to advance to the Final Phase.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.140
However, we are most concerned
with your overall impression.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.350
This refers to any intangible factors

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.400
not previously mentioned.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.650
You could consider this

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.660
an evaluation of your potential as a Hunter.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.930
And we also incorporate the
opinions of your peers.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.170
That was our process.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.820
<i>Based on performance,
I should be ranked higher...</i>

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.600
<i>Do I have less potential than Gon?</i>

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.140
The battle rules are quite simple.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.470
Weapons are allowed.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.670
No cheating.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.370
If your opponent admits defeat, you win.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.440
However!

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.560
If you kill your opponent,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.140
you will be immediately disqualified.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.800
All remaining applicants will pass,
and the exam will end.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.700
Are we clear?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.030
Then, we shall begin the exam's Final Phase.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.860
The first match is Hanzo versus Gon.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.310
Please step forward.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.290
I will serve as the referee.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.540
My name is Masta.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.550
Best of luck.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.890
Hey, good to see you again.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.590
You were tailing me during the Fourth Phase.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.280
You noticed?

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.440
Naturally...

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.850
I'm assuming that each applicant was
assigned an examiner for the Fourth Phase.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.750
Well, I'm sure everyone else noticed.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.610
<i>I had no idea.</i>

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.860
<i>I obviously noticed.</i>

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.210
I thought it wasn't worth mentioning.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.610
Y-Yeah...

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.110
<i>How was I supposed to notice that?</i>

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.940
You have my thanks.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.710
My rank was higher because your
reports on me were accurate.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.590
Though the outcome was never in doubt!

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.550
Y-Yes...

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.630
Moving on,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.030
I have a question for you.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.880
What is it?

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.010
We only win if our opponent
surrenders, correct?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.660
It doesn't count if we knock them unconscious.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.500
No TKOs allowed, either.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.520
Yes, that is correct.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.270
<i>I see.</i>

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.170
<i>This one could be difficult...</i>

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.990
<i>He looks tough, but we should be even</i>

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.780
<i>in terms of strength and speed.</i>

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.030
<i>I can use my speed to keep on the
move until I get an opening.</i>

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.280
Now then, it's time to begin.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.290
<i>Get him, Gon!</i>

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.290
<i>How well can he do against Hanzo?</i>

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.050
Begin!

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.060
<i>Put some distance between us...</i>

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.440
You must be confident in your legs.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.520
You have my respect.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.240
You did well for a kid.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.410
<i>Tsk.</i>

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.210
<i>I could have easily dodged that attack.</i>

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:34.230
Well, this would already be over
if it were a normal fight...

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.390
Here, wake up.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.040
You must feel terrible.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.550
I hit you hard enough to make
your brain bounce around.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.460
Do you understand?
You have no chance against me.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.690
Might as well give up now...

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.030
No way...

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.040
Think about it.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.420
If you surrender now, you'll still be in
decent shape for your next fight.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.290
There's no reason to be stubborn.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.480
Just surrender.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.430
Never gonna happen!

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.650
Surrender.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.640
Gon! Don't be silly!

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.910
You'll still have another chance!

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.500
You should...

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.410
Leorio!

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.790
If you were in Gon's position,
would you surrender?

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.530
Hell, no!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.670
That guy thinks he's hot stuff...

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.670
Gon feels the same way!

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.260
I know! I know that...

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.020
But there isn't any other choice!

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.350
You're contradicting yourself,

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.070
but I understand how you feel!

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.730
<i>Yield this fight, Gon!</i>

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.770
<i>It's suicide!</i>

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:16.780
Honestly, the chairman's nasty
streak is in a class all its own.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.510
What do you mean?

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.730
The applicants who've made it this far

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.290
are unlikely to simply surrender.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.290
True.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.560
This goes beyond a "rather peculiar fight."

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.160
This system is just plain crazy.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.050
That kid's in danger.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:53.150
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.150
Hanzo

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.420
It's been three hours.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.170
There's nothing left for him to vomit.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.770
Get up.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.740
Enough, already...

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.830
I'm gonna kill you!

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.690
I'll fight you in his place!

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.360
If you can't take it, leave.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.320
It's only going to get worse.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.070
What was that?!

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.070
No one may interfere in a one-on-one match.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.700
And if you step in, Gon will be
the one disqualified!

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.960
It's okay...

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.580
Leorio.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.200
This is...

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:58.260
nothing...

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.970
I-I can still fight...

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:13.690
I'm going to break your arm.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.800
I'm not joking around,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.070
so give up.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.540
Surrender.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.140
Never!

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.840
He really broke his arm.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.660
There you go.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.350
You can't use your left arm anymore.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.610
Kurapika, don't try to stop me.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.610
If that bastard does anything else to Gon...

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.520
Sorry, Gon, but I can't stop myself.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.190
Me?

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.020
Stop you?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.920
Don't worry.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.380
There is no chance of that happening.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.680
I'm sure you're in too much pain to listen,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.780
but hear me out.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.880
I am descended from the shinobi,
a clan of covert agents.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.510
From the day I was born, I was forced

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.520
to endure harsh training in order
to master the art of ninpo.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.670
For eighteen years,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:41.360
I have trained my body and
technique, without rest.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.410
By the time I was your age,
I had already killed a man.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.910
<i>Heh, that's nothing to brag about.</i>

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.730
At this point in time,
you cannot defeat me in combat.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.000
I'm trying to be nice.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.880
Admit defeat—

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.550
Ow...

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600
Damn it!

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.600
My head's cleared a bit, after all the
pain and that long explanation.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.850
Yes!

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.880
Gon, go!

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.610
Kick him while he's down!

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.990
If you're eighteen, you're only
six years older than I am.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:32.260
Besides, this isn't a battle
to see who's stronger.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.500
It's to see who's willing to surrender first.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.090
I let you kick me on purpose.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:44.060
Liar!

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.800
You don't understand...

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.790
This isn't a warning.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.680
It's an ultimatum.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.890
Was it too hard for you to understand?

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.060
Then I'll make it easier for you.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.970
I'll cut off your legs,

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.320
so that they can't be reattached.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.570
A permanent injury should
help to wake you up.

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.990
But first, I'll ask you once more.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.080
Surrender.

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.300
I won't accept that!

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.440
I don't want my legs cut off,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.470
but I don't want to surrender.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.690
So let's find a different way to fight!

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.100
Hey... Do you understand
your own situation?!

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.110
Excuse me.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.230
You don't get to make demands!

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.520
Are you trying to insult me?!

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.110
I'm seriously gonna cut off your legs!

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.120
But I still will not surrender.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.950
Besides, if you do that,
I'll bleed to death.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.350
He'll be disqualified if that happens, right?

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.130
Oh, yes.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.740
See?

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.840
Neither of us wants that to happen.

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.380
So let's think of a better way.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.640
I think he's okay now.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.140
Gon's taken control.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.820
He's so self-centered...

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.400
But he's succeeded in convincing
Hanzo and the rest of us.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.250
Honestly...

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.980
<i>What is this?</i>

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.490
<i>The situation hasn't changed.</i>

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.160
<i>Gon hasn't gotten stronger than his opponent.</i>

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.290
<i>His arm is still broken!</i>

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.460
<i>So why is the brutal
atmosphere from before</i>

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.540
<i>suddenly so much lighter?</i>

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.640
You really don't get it...

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.020
If you die, you'll never get another chance.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.470
If I kill you here,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.100
I need only try again next year.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.530
We are not on equal footing!

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.030
<i>He's right, Gon.</i>

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.180
<i>You can try all you want
to talk your way out of this,</i>

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.250
<i>but he's far stronger than you.</i>

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.190
<i>That isn't something you can
neutralize on the spot.</i>

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.290
<i>It all comes down to power.</i>

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.490
Why won't you concede?
It's easy to do.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.830
You can try again next year.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.870
You value your pride more
than your own life?!

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.700
You're really willing to die for your pride?!

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.710
I'm going to find my dad.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.220
Your dad?

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.460
My dad is a Hunter.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.040
So I'm going to become a Hunter
and find him!

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.280
I believe that I'll find him one day...

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.910
But I have a feeling that if I give up now,

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.090
I'll never find him!

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.160
So I won't surrender.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.250
If you don't yield, you'll die...

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.680
<i>He defies reason.</i>

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.190
I give up. You win.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.730
I can't kill you.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.050
But I can't think of a way
to make you surrender.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.200
I'll take this loss and take my
chances in the next battle!

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.380
I can't accept that.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.950
That's not fair!

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.210
We both have to think of
a way to settle this fight!

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.960
Heh, I knew you would say that.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.510
You fool!

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.810
There's no point, because you'll
never surrender!

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.780
But I don't want to win like this!

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.180
What am I supposed to do?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.220
We can work together to figure it out!

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.010
In other words, I've already
given up on this match,

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.490
but you want me to try to win again,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:01.020
while helping to determine a way to
make you feel good about your victory!

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.240
Is that right?

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.370
Uh-huh!

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.120
You moron!

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.950
Hey, ref.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.290
I lose. Let's move on to the next match.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.510
Understood.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.460
But I want to tell the executive
committee something first.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.020
When he wakes up,

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:19.320
he'll probably refuse his passing judgment.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.340
Because he's a stubborn boy,

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.810
as we've seen.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.800
Only one person will fail this round, right?

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:32.020
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.310
Gon's victory has been assured,
following Hanzo's concession.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.660
The Final Phase, to determine
the single failing applicant,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.530
has only just begun.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.860
Next time: Baffling x Turn Of x Events!

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.530
They got Gon, too!
