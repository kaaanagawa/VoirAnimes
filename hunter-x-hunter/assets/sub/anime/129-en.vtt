WEBVTT

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.840
The revived King, now calling himself Meruem,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.730
carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.620
in order to recover his memories.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.660
Pouf's main body is with the King!

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.380
They're heading toward the palace
at an alarming speed.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.270
That probably means the chairman lost.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.400
What can the rest of us do?

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.980
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900
What's happening?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.530
Where is the Supreme Leader?

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.530
It won't stop following us.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.340
That's annoying.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.260
It's the enemy's power.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.390
I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.120
the enemy's physical body.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.490
Ah, how interesting.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.580
I shall test it.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.650
Incredible, that's my...

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.280
I understand.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.240
My power was not meant for me.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.980
It was meant to be used by the King!

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.710
Youpi.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.820
This does not make sense.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.580
If you knew this power resulted
from an enemy's attack,

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.290
that means either you saw it used,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.010
or it was used on you.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.270
Which was it?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.140
I was hit by an attack.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.490
I cannot see it following you now.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.120
So why does the enemy still live?

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.190
How did you free yourself
from the enemy's power?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.600
Answer me.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.780
We made an agreement.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.050
In exchange for releasing me from his power,

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.050
I agreed to spare his comrade.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.670
Then, after he released you,

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.530
you had the opportunity to finish
him off along with his comrade.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.560
Why did you not do so?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.550
Honestly, I'm not sure.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.450
I believe I felt that, if I had,
I would have lost in some way.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.740
I felt that breaking a promise,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.480
even a promise to an enemy,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.710
would be equivalent to conceding defeat.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.180
Impossible!

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.960
You're saying that your personal emotions

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.400
were the reason you spared the lives
of those who oppose the King?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.470
I'm prepared to accept any punishment...

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.290
I have no excuses to offer.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.610
I only ordered that you not lie to me.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.110
I have no reason to punish
those who speak the truth.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.360
Pouf.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.870
Yes!

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.120
Youpi.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.250
Yes!

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.840
We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.280
Our bodies and souls have been linked...

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.140
It is no longer possible for the three of
us to hide anything from one another!

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.020
Your Majesty!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.270
Your Majesty...

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.370
Let us go.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.550
Yes!

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.370
Your Majesty...

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.550
Was that meant as a final warning

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.660
because you realize what I plan to do,
and the guilt it makes me feel?

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:38.880
Nevertheless!

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.790
Even if it means I am executed for my crime...

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.510
I do this for the King!

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.890
Where is she? Find her!

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:52.980
Hurry up and find her!

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.680
For the sake of our species!

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.100
Where is she?

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.900
Find her!

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.400
She is not necessary!

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.440
Find her, quickly!

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.170
I do this for the King.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.940
Is she over there?

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.390
Wait! Not there!

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.910
No! That way!

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.410
Hey!

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.920
When you're split up, you can't hurt me.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.840
You're ignoring me?

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.200
Wait up!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.120
You can't remove APR without defeating me!

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.930
Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.400
Does the enemy who attached this

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.180
also have the ability to teleport?

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.960
That's someone else...

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.310
There's one who can make himself
and those around him invisible.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.500
He looks like a chameleon.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.780
I don't know his name, but he's
one of the Squadron Leaders.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.940
Which means he's a traitor!

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.290
So you spared not only humans,
but a traitor, as well?

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.760
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.370
Your Majesty!

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.830
Until we've defeated them, please...

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.360
I do not care. It is irrelevant.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.940
On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.340
that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.660
Youpi...

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.880
We must accept your emotional instability,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.130
as well as the traitor's betrayal,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.770
as we move forward.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.000
Humans are a sacrifice meant to help
us attain the next level of evolution.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.740
The perfect sacrifice.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.730
Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.170
any lingering traces of the human ego will

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.790
be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.500
The King's opinion had completely
reversed following the explosion.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.390
Was it due to the impact?

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.730
No.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.940
This was the King, as well.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.920
If the enemy can become invisible,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.460
I can find him by making contact.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.360
I need to split myself

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.070
into the smallest clones
that can still retain sight,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.280
and expand the search!

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.530
Bastard...

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.660
Clearly, I'm not his target.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.670
He turned back just like that... Who is he after?

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.810
Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.270
That's bad, then!

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:38.510
I can't think of any way to defeat the
King without Meleoron's ability...

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.690
I must protect Meleoron at any cost!

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.230
Pouf divided his clones to the point where
they're too small for me to see.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.360
Unlike his main body, his clones have to be

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.070
at full size for me to see them.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.210
The man with the pompadour
was obviously just a decoy.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:12.340
They must know we've realized
that the chameleon is a traitor.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.720
In other words, they believe that I've
returned to dispose of the traitor.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.380
Assuming the chameleon is concealing
himself and the others as they flee,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.920
and that the woman is among them,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.110
if I get close, they will protect the
chameleon and abandon her!

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:39.240
Because they believe the
chameleon is my target.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.130
They must have never imagined that I'd return

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.210
to kill the woman that Pitou was
trying so desperately to heal.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.760
If they believe I've returned to rescue
the woman, it's even better!

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.640
They may even offer to hand her
over to me with conditions.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.690
He must be after Meleoron.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.050
Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.410
Hold on.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.840
Let's make sure.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.570
The door leading underground?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.610
So that's it...

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.770
They realized that I know they
can become invisible,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.150
and decided to give me two options.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.530
The chameleon either ran inside
or fled somewhere else.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.780
Their plan is to split up my clones
further, to weaken me.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.240
No! Over there! Over there!

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.660
Over there! Over there! Over there!

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.210
What?

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.410
They're giving me two options.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.810
But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.230
Then they want to know which is my target?

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.300
Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.320
Or do I send the majority of them after
the chameleon, to fool them?

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.680
Even if the shutter is closed,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.340
I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.550
No, I don't have time for that!

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.620
I'll go after

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.970
the woman!

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.730
So she's his target?

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.860
I only have to kill the woman

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.730
and hide her body from the
King for a short time.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:17.330
My clone can manage that!

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.240
I only need a minute or two!

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.430
He's...

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.720
incredibly fast!

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.740
Then she's your target?

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.190
I'm up for a game of tag.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.330
I can go all night.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.290
Judging by how quickly he reacted,

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.140
it would be hard to catch him,
even at full strength.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.420
If I don't hurry, the King will arrive.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:00.920
What do I do?

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:06.450
Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:08.160
I know!

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.410
The greatest magic of all...

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.400
He split himself up?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.450
But he won't be big enough to take her away!

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.420
Is he going to attack me first?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.050
Your plan is going to backfire...

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.480
You've reduced your speed and power,

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.180
so I don't even need to use Godspeed.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.170
Cease this futile resistance.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.820
Your plans have already been thwarted!

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.040
What is the point in adding
to your transgressions?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.570
If it is fear of retribution driving
you to flee, you needn't worry.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.080
The King will forgive you.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.480
He is a benevolent ruler.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:55.730
Don't make me laugh!

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.450
You think I'll believe that?

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.950
You'll probably tie me to a tree,
and turn me into a soldier!

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.840
The King?

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.270
That's right...

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.610
Keep running.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.600
Take her far from the King first!

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.310
That confirms it...

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.600
I don't know the reason,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.050
but this girl is important to the King.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.960
For Gon... For the sake of our mission...

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.020
I can't let the enemy have her!

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.360
That's right...

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.280
The person chasing us sounded like

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.870
one of the people with the Supreme Leader...

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.680
Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.010
Then who is this person?

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.790
Who are the people he was with?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.390
Your twisted sense of justice
will never help the people!

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.000
First, I cast a spell on the woman.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.650
I use magic words to make her suspicious...

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.610
The King and I seek open dialogue.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.900
Now, release her at once!

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.450
Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.870
What is he up to?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.340
Let me go...

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.640
Please put me down!

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.790
Something's wrong with you!

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.760
You're all tingly!

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.630
What are you talking about, fool?

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.760
I'm trying to save you!

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.110
You're lying!

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:28.160
I'm lying?

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.920
You trust that insect more than you trust me?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.020
Insect?

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.560
What are you talking about?!

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.710
That's right... She can't see!

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.470
Let go! Let me go!

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.440
That'll make it hard to explain.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.800
Damn... Almost.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.860
It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.770
If the woman you're carrying resists,
your speed will also fall...

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.890
What's going on?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.460
He wasn't aiming for me...

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.800
He was aiming for the woman.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.800
He was trying to kill her!

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.390
If she escapes, that's fine.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.560
If she distracts him with her resistance,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.570
allowing me to kill her, even better!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.450
Komugi-san!

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.690
The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.900
They will not kill you...

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.260
Keep struggling!

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.000
Keep fighting back!

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.670
I'll save you soon!

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.840
She was knocked out, so that's impossible.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.780
Well, I have no idea what's going on here,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.480
but I know that you're making me mad.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.180
If you enter this ring,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.440
I'll kill you.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.200
You may be a clone,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.630
but you were formed from the original's cells.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.380
If I burn those cells, they die.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.270
Electricity...

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.390
Come on... I'll whittle you down.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.390
Are you having difficulty?

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.150
I can feel your impatience.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.270
I shall lend you a hand.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.860
It's nothing you need to worry about.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.470
Your first priority should be regaining
your memories, Meruem-sama.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.360
Once my main body has returned,
I can deal with the intruders easily.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.290
Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.780
Humans, as far as we can see!

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.800
Do you remember now?

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.530
They are all here for you...

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.430
They all belong to you!

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.030
They belong to me?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.990
You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.790
and stand atop the food chain.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.910
That is your glorious destiny!

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.700
As willed by the heavens!

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.990
Something isn't right...

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.840
There's still something else...

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.220
Something else I've forgotten.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.280
What are you saying?

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.220
Nothing could be more important
than ruling over all life forms...

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.360
I suppose.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.100
Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.360
However...

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:22.720
The pain won't cease.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.620
Why is the palace in shambles?

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.000
It was destroyed in the battle.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.380
It happened after you left the palace.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.380
Where is the place I spent most of my time in?

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.890
It has been completely destroyed...

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.900
I suppose I should look at what's left.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:57.150
Yes, you may find something that will
help you regain your memories...

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.380
This is bad!

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:04.720
That could be it...

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.990
The Gungi board and pieces!

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.920
They may be the key to awakening his memory!

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.420
I must dispose of them!

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.770
He gave up?

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.980
Over there.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.710
Let's go.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.780
Next time: Magic x Of x Despair.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.120
Killua, thanks.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.340
What's this about?

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.030
We're buddies, right?

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.910
Yeah, but still...

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.620
Thanks.
