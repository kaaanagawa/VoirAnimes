00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.710
He abandoned you when you were still just a baby.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.960
But you still want to...

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.900
He was willing to abandon his own kid for it.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.660
That's how amazing it is to be a Hunter!

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.560
You really are his son...

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.540
The last test to be accepted
by Ging-san is to find him.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.940
It's a task more difficult than any Hunt.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.010
As far as I know, he's the greatest Hunter there is.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.170
There's something that I want.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.790
He never told me what it
was that he wanted.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.550
Catch me if you can.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.970
You are a Hunter, aren't you?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.270
Ging...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Past x And x Future

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.400
You want to climb the tree?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.980
No one under the age of eighteen
can go beyond this point.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.030
Unless you have some special
license or certification...

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.220
A pro Hunter?

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.470
At your age?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.140
Excuse me, then.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.260
Go right ahead.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.980
But I'll need you to sign this first.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.250
Even a president would have to sign it.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.990
It's just the usual thing that says you
don't care if you die during the climb.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.750
Here's some advice!

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.260
Don't trust any of the grips or footholds
left behind by previous climbers.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.990
Those who make it to the top
usually do it bare-handed.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.050
That's how the guy who's at
the top right now did it.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.520
Got it! Thanks!

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.320
Well, if you feel you're in trouble,
just press that button.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.870
Our rescue team is skilled.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.670
If you can hold on to the tree for ten minutes—

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.910
He fell?!

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.790
Hey!

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.270
Hey!

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.570
He's already up there?

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.630
I still have a long way to go...

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.330
This tree is incredible.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.080
I can entrust myself to it.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.380
The moment my fingers touch it,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.390
I can feel that there's life there,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.070
and that it flows throughout the entire tree.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.720
I can do this!

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.450
So long as I heed the tree's whispering as I climb...

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.310
Help...

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.360
Help me...

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.760
Almost there.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.060
The top looks funny.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.100
They're huge!

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.980
That scared me...

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.740
Hi!

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.930
Yo.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.940
I was tired of waiting.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.890
Ging...

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.260
How long did it take you to get
here from the 500-meter point?

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.220
Uh...

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.440
Around twenty minutes?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.710
Well, I guess that's acceptable for your first time...

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:41.980
Eat up.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.270
Yep!

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.980
Beautiful view, right?

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.750
On overcast days, it's like a sea of clouds.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.650
Yeah!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.290
Hey, Ging...

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.480
Hmm?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.190
Can I ask you something?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.990
Sure. I might not give you an answer, though.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.530
What is it that you want?

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.000
That which I can't see in front of me right now.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.500
That which you can't see in front of you?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.560
I wanted to become a Hunter because...

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.300
Shut up!

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.570
I wanted to become a Hunter because,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:57.490
at the time, it was the most practical way

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.580
to get into the place I wanted to go.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.760
That place was used as a certain
royal family's burial ground.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.590
To enter, you had to belong to
a trustworthy organization,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.600
and to agree never to speak of it.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.290
And you had to pay all expenses out of pocket.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.850
In other words, you couldn't really explore it at all.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.320
You won't find anyone willing to spend

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.670
the resources and receive nothing in return.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.290
But I saw it as my chance.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.640
If I became a trusted pro Hunter,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.820
getting the money wouldn't be a problem.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.720
When I turned fifteen,

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.040
I set up a special nonprofit organization

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.090
to explore and repair the tomb.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.040
Before that, I'd spent the two
years after getting my license

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.450
surfing archaeology buffs' websites and blogs online.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.020
To create the nonprofit, I needed about ten oddballs

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.770
who didn't need money or fame,
but only wanted to know the truth,

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.690
and who could be trusted to keep secrets.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.760
I'm always going after what I need.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:29.510
I'm so focused, I stop caring about
the ultimate goal that lies beyond.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.360
Too hard to understand?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.050
Then I guess I'll keep going.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.230
The people I recruited online and
befriended in offline meetings

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.810
were all older than me.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.260
They were regular office workers,
graduate students, and job-hoppers.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.100
After I told them my background and plan,

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:03.120
they helped with the various tasks
to create the nonprofit,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.940
and they even gave donations
from what little money they had.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.270
When our dream was realized and
we stepped inside for the first time,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.300
the best part for me

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.000
wasn't when I finally witnessed the truth of the tomb.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.230
It was when I looked

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.850
at my colleagues' faces and shook their hands.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.230
To this day, they still work for the
nonprofit with zero compensation,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.620
providing me with viable information.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.000
The secret of the tomb

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.610
was nothing compared to the relationships I built.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:01.560
What was truly important came
to me before what I wanted.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.450
And now?

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.900
Huh?

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.650
What are you after now?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.490
Right now?

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.720
It'll take some time to explain...

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.060
Gon,

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.090
what is this tree we just climbed?

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.770
Huh? It's the World Tree.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.860
That's right.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.430
Down below, how did they describe the tree?

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.930
At 1,784 meters, it's the world's tallest tree.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.180
Technically, that's right.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.630
But the truth is that this tree

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.690
is a young sapling that's stopped growing.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.890
A World Tree that

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.450
didn't receive enough nutrition,
and could only grow this tall.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.210
A real World Tree

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.270
would take in magma,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.530
embed its roots in the mountains,

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.270
and continue to grow after leaving the atmosphere.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.220
Outside this world.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.610
This world?

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.110
The world map that you're familiar with.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.540
The Ants that you and the chairman fought

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.300
were a non-native species from outside this world.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.800
That's the truth they don't teach you in school.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.440
Adults with common sense

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.790
choose not to go near Pandora's Box.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.280
In other words, the world that we know

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.600
is nothing but a small part of a much bigger world.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.120
There are records showing that a chosen few,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.640
from a select time and place,
were able to make it outside.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.210
Understand now?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.100
I still want the same thing I always have.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.440
Something that I can't see in front of me.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.530
There are many requirements to go outside.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.710
At least four are required before
you can even start the journey.

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:27.780
Authorization,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.220
the means,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.210
qualification,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.220
a contract.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.450
I still haven't obtained a single one.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.870
But I'm in no rush.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.900
I'm enjoying the journey.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:49.560
So if our paths happen to cross in the future...

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.740
You should enjoy the little detours.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.360
To the fullest.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.790
Because that's where you'll find the things

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.730
more important than what you want.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.230
Oh!

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:31.720
Ging...

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:34.590
Here.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:39.580
Kite asked me to return this to you.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.640
Oh, okay.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:01.310
The scar's still on my shoulder.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.410
See? Right here.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.560
And then, there was a huge boom!

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:16.530
And what popped out was
another coffin, just this big.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:23.350
They're called the Testing Gates,
and you have to open them to go inside.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.550
Marshal

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.550
Spy

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.420
You should enjoy the little detours.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.340
To the fullest.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.650
Because that's where you'll find the things

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.540
more important than what you want.
