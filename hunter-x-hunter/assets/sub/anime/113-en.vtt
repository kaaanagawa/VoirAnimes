WEBVTT

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.520
The King!

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.020
An x Indebted x Insect

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.630
Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.670
The central stairway was destroyed,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.180
with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.140
Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.070
who had barely managed to
make it to the second floor.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.280
Below,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.610
the ones hit at closest range
by Youpi's attack were Shoot...

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.290
This is bad.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.040
My leg's destroyed.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.400
Shoot!

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.080
...and Morel.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.220
The rest is up to you.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.640
Knuckle...

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.380
He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.040
Stupid tricks!

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.950
One attack by Youpi

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.220
tore apart the Deep Purple puppets,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.190
but Morel had deliberately
positioned them with that in mind.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.240
They were just decoys?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.240
That resistance...

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.990
This is more than smoke!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.000
The weapon was the only
thing that wasn't smoke?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.510
Fool! You won't get away!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.950
After using his own weapon as a decoy,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.020
Morel had no option left but to run.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.520
But...

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.750
Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.220
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.040
That...

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.140
That punch was meant to send
him flying over the horizon.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.790
The total is 590?

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.670
Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.070
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.830
in the form of interest as time progresses
from the activation of the ability.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.320
Lost sight of him...

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.420
Damn you!

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.260
The enraged Youpi

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.900
returned to his senses because his multiple
eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.150
With his right leg broken,

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.330
Shoot unconsciously used his remaining
leg to stand on one of his own fists.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.800
Despite that he had never attempted it before,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.320
Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.710
And he had no clear reason
to cover his right eye.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.580
He was just enjoying the fact

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.970
that he continued to gain strength
while the situation deteriorated.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.960
Fueled by adversity itself,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.450
Shoot took flight.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.510
His tremendous speed and vigor

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.910
succeeded in forcing Youpi to
concentrate on defense for a few seconds.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.590
All in order

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.270
to help the others.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.390
Shoot, Knuckle...

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.320
Once we finish this, first thing we do
is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.740
That's the only way I can get you guys
to let me give you a big hug.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.650
The debris cloud raised by the destruction

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.220
was the perfect cover for Morel to expand
his smoke aura throughout the palace

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.600
so he could monitor the course of the battle.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.170
Morel's objective was the throne room.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.740
When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:19.140
Gon and Killua evaded the attack
and changed direction.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.990
They planned to jump from

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.080
the east tower's second floor to the central
tower's third floor, where the throne room was.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.230
Upon hitting the ground, they passed
Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.120
for the elevator underground.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.690
His ability that let him control corpses
like part of his own body,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.380
Living Dead Dolls, granted him
the use of multiple sets of eyes,

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.730
which had allowed him to
dodge Dragon Dive unscratched.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.630
In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.550
two soldier Ants in the direction

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.370
that Ikalgo was headed.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.130
In the next moment, Killua had taken off.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.740
Killua?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.260
Why is he heading toward the elevator?

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.990
What am I doing?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.130
What's wrong with me?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.790
It was only natural that Killua would
be surprised by his own actions.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.870
He was the one

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.500
who had instructed the others
to stick to their own tasks.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.520
At that point, Killua's mind completely froze.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:10.280
However, while his mind panicked,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.630
his body continued to move efficiently,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.870
keeping aura usage to a minimum,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.030
while swiftly and accurately

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.720
gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities
and movements, and halting them.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.780
Only Ikalgo and one other
saw what had happened.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.970
Damn...

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.510
What have I

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.290
done?

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.030
Killua,

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.030
I owe you one.

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.980
After he realized what he'd done,
a tangle of emotions

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.270
had left Killua lost in confusion,

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.820
until Ikalgo's words woke him.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.890
By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.960
Killua was already moving on.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.740
Flutter?

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.240
Something's wrong.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.520
At either end of the hall leading to the
elevator underground were the servant quarters,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.600
which soldier Ants currently occupied.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.000
Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.010
and at the moment when he reached the elevator,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.670
the doors at both ends opened simultaneously.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.280
From the doors appeared...

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.970
Cheetu...

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.440
Brovada!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.560
After seeing Flutter,

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.580
Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled
that something was wrong.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:05.870
That was too fast.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.800
Once they spotted the enemy,
the two soldiers raised an alert.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.520
Right afterward, they were killed.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.180
The time between the intruder's
return down the hallway

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:25.220
and Flutter's appearance was too short!

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.070
Which means they must have passed
one another in the hallway.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.250
Then why were the soldiers killed,

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.000
but not Flutter?

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.070
Is Flutter on the enemy's side?

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.540
Meaning...

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.860
He's a traitor!

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.560
Is he acting on his own, or...

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.140
Is it Hagya's... Or rather...

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.670
Leol's orders?

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.380
This is pathetic.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.130
When he needed me most, I wasn't there.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.860
And I call myself a Royal Guard?

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.760
I don't even know where the King is.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.230
And I call myself a Royal Guard?

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.680
No.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.970
I am a failure!

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.760
It's that simple...

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:52.390
Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.960
The ideals he prioritized were
unyielding and absolute.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.460
Pouf, the former Royal Guard.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.350
Now, Pouf...

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:13.810
Useless Pouf...

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.720
You utter fool.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.610
You failure of a Royal Guard!

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.980
Where will you go now?

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.090
You have no idea?

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.840
And if the King isn't there,

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.990
then you'll be more useless
than scum, won't you?

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.980
No, useless Pouf...

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.310
You just refuse to accept reality.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:45.650
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!!!!

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.930
You don't want him spending
time with that woman!

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.760
His emotions were directed at
the King as well as himself.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.520
An absolute King,

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.530
feeling concern for a lowly human...

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.470
Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.770
It is unforgivable!

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.200
But...

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.180
That's probably where the King is...

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.260
Before I came here, I knew that much.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.640
I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because
I didn't know the King's location.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.210
I failed because I knew where,
and I didn't go there!

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.180
Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.700
You are now a mere bug!

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:42.760
You can no longer expect anything of yourself.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.790
Nor are you allowed, then,
to expect anything of the King!

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.280
I can only work for the King...

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.200
For the King... For the King...
For the King... For the King...

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.200
For the King! For the King! For the King!

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.330
For the King!

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.850
For the King!

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.210
Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism,

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.990
prevented him from thinking clearly in the
seconds after he arrived in the throne room.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.410
I must go to the King.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:32.480
Yo.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.740
You're gonna ignore me?!

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.660
He goes straight to the King without a glance.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.740
Unfortunately, you've been surrounded.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.000
What must I do

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.460
to have you let me out?

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.260
Oh, I'm not letting you out.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.250
I see...

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.160
Spiritual Message
Love Spring of Moth Scales

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.580
<i>Spiritual Message.</i>

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.390
That's Morel's Smoky Jail...

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.470
The ability he's using to separate
Pouf from the King.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.640
If the third floor of the tower
is surrounded by smoke,

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.710
the King and Pitou aren't there.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.650
Where are they?

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.560
Gon was raring to fight.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.710
Next time: Divide x And x Conquer.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.840
No, I don't wanna leave you!

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.010
It's okay! We're connected
by an invisible bond!

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.720
There you go again—

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.340
Two sides of the same coin.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.060
Two peas in a pod!
