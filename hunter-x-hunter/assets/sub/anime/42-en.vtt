WEBVTT

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:00.980
They're coming.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.980
They are definitely coming!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.030
Defend x And x Attack

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.820
September 1st.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.440
The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.940
had chosen to reunite in Yorknew City.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.040
On this morning, Gon and Killua

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.320
were visiting the Yorknew market.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.660
Wow, there are so many people!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.070
But this market's purpose

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.300
is to swindle people who
have come for the auction.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.140
What?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.290
This isn't the auction venue?

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.790
Obviously.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.680
Yorknew's dream auction

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.190
is held once a year in the
world's largest auction house.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.030
They say that, just during the
ten days of official bidding,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.940
tens of trillions of Jenny exchange hands.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.060
Tens of trillions?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.370
Yeah, an item sold for ten thousand

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.570
can be turned around for a
hundred million the next day.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.490
You can make a fortune instantly.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.870
It's where dreams come true.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.330
Wow...

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.310
Well, that's why a lot

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
of underworld auctioning
happens at the same time.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.090
That's awesome...

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.310
Anyway, do you think Kurapika
and Leorio will show up?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.290
They promised to meet us here.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.040
I'm sure they'll come.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.080
Yeah.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.220
They might try to contact us.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.220
Hey, you have to buy a phone!

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.670
It's standard Hunter gear.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.280
Ah, that's true.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.360
Hey! Welcome!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.880
This one's great...

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.460
It's the hottest current model!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.420
Super-thin and no bigger than a credit card.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.370
It has GPS, which comes in
handy for meeting with people.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.840
Don't bother.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.370
Hmm?

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.630
That feature doesn't work in many countries,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.180
and it isn't even waterproof.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.630
That model is for people
who only make calls.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.790
Leorio!

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.790
Yo!

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.100
I would recommend...

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.800
this Beetle 07.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.510
It's a little heavy and pricey,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.420
but it includes a translator for the
two hundred languages used worldwide.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.870
What? Seriously?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.760
Go with this one.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.550
I'll buy one, too!

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.310
Yeah!

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.160
Two, please.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.320
Two will cost four hundred thousand.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.760
Four hundred thousand?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.290
That's expensive, pops!

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.820
Thanks, Leorio!

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.640
But, damn, 110,580 Jenny apiece, huh?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.180
It's a new model, so that's a
fair price in this market.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.610
Still, talk about overkill.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.790
I've never seen

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.960
a cell phone purchase greeted
with applause before.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.830
But you really saved us.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.610
Just so you know, that was nothing.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.850
The serious dealing only starts
when the seller tells you to leave.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.620
He's the last person you
would find at an auction.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.640
No kidding.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.170
So how are you guys doing?

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.290
What do you mean?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.040
You've trained and gotten stronger, right?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.980
What?!

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.260
You returned the tag to
Hisoka at Heavens Arena?

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.410
And you have to be pretty good
to make it to the 200s...

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.400
How strong have you gotten now?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.290
Hey, did you learn <i>Nen</i>, Leorio?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.000
Yeah, you bet.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.380
Awesome!

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.470
Really?

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.910
Why would I lie to you?

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.330
It's the ability to build up a shroud
of aura, one's own life force...

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.510
That's <i>Ten</i>,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.520
one of the four major
principles for learning <i>Nen</i>.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.980
Eh? There's more to it?

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.490
Figured as much.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.780
<i>Greed Island</i> ? What's that?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.780
A legendary game.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.710
We're trying to get a copy at the auction.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.530
But why a game?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.910
I think this game holds a
clue to finding my dad.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:11.900
Huh?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.190
The game holds a clue to finding your dad?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.470
What do you mean?

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.890
Well, it's a long story.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.200
Anyway, the problem is the cost.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.180
How much are we talking?

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.300
The lowest starting bid is

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.050
8.9 billion Jenny.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.980
8.9 billion?!

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.310
How much do you have?

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.920
We made some bad investments,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.310
so we're down to 5 million.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.470
Listen up, kids...

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.430
This event is held at Southern Piece,
the world's finest auction house.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.640
The money you have won't
cover the entry fee.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.650
But the game has a low difficulty rank
on the Hunter site's treasure list.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.450
Really?

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.260
Because you only need
money to get a copy.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.330
It always comes back to money.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.990
This world runs on money!

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.210
Well...

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.670
That just means that a real
treasure can't be bought.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.130
If you can't obtain an item
like this with ease,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.180
you can't be considered
a pro Hunter, right?

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.680
I don't need you to tell me that.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.270
But first, we need money...

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.240
We'll need some starting funds.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.180
Let's find a way to make
some money in Yorknew!

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.030
Yeah!

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.090
A simple fool.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.950
Leorio's probably also an Enhancer.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.450
Damn! What's wrong?!

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.330
I created a complete
duplicate of the program.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.080
Why aren't any events being triggered?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.210
Did Kil somehow trick me?

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.340
No... No way.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.850
He isn't capable of creating a fake game,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.770
and he's not stupid enough
to lie over a deal.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.310
Was he tricked when he
obtained this card?

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.300
I want to know the answer.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.440
I'll do whatever it takes to
uncover this secret...

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.060
No matter how much I have to pay.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.690
I have 12.7 billion left.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.200
I'll need at least twice that amount

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.510
to guarantee a winning bid...

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.690
Dad, I want to make a deal.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.820
I'll kill fifteen people,
so lend me 15 billion.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.370
Got it.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.400
Bye.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.780
Autopilot engaged to Lingon Airport.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.620
I think I was ten...

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.390
The last time I went outside.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.600
Huh? Swap?

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.600
What does that mean?

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.260
"Swap."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.010
An auction technique.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.960
Slang for the exchange of goods.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.600
Also see "Bind."

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.120
What's a bind?

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.270
"Bind."

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.890
The seller names a condition
besides money as their price.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.170
The winning bid will be the
one that comes closest

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.950
to meeting that condition.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.250
Condition?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.750
No idea what that means.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.720
So that's it...

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.960
There's another kind of auctioning...

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.400
Tonight, at 9 PM,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.090
the mummy of Princess Corco
will be auctioned off.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.340
Ivlenkov,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.340
Tocino,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.350
and Baise,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.070
you'll handle the bidding.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.120
Will three people be enough?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.700
Each group of bidders
is limited to three people.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.230
You cannot bring weapons,
recorders, or communication devices.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:31.240
All on-site security is handled by
the Mafia that runs the auction,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.940
so there's rarely any trouble.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.890
All it takes is one wrong move

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.120
to turn every Mafia member,
worldwide, against you.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.750
This auction is built on trust.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.070
Which is why the Mafia don't
use security cameras.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.190
The unspoken rule is that

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.140
any grudges and the like are left outside.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.140
Which means

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.130
that if anything does happen,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.310
their testimony will decide everything.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.520
Their words are treated as gospel.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.660
So it's imperative to make
a good impression.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.400
Don't start any petty fights.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.910
Avoid talking to anyone
outside this group.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.280
What about the rest of us?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.410
Basho and Linssen

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.910
will cover the rear entrance.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.920
Kurapika and Melody will
take the front entrance.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.320
Squala and I will guard the lady.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.050
And with that,

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.720
the mission begins.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.140
Come on down!

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.600
Let's have some
conditional auctioning fun!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.390
Here's what's up for bid.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.150
A diamond worth three million.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.530
Comes with the appraisal of the
store where I just bought it.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.420
Arm wrestling will decide the winning bid.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.530
The first person to beat this
boy wins the diamond.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.040
You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.040
Now, let's start

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.480
the auction!

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.780
Yeah! It's mine!

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:06.610
I'm in!

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:07.960
Count me in!

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.460
Okay, don't push...

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.980
Form a line.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.160
Adjust your strength to
match the opponent.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.430
Every now and then,
pretend to be struggling.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.360
Okay, you're first!

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.600
You need to pay the entry fee up front.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.350
Here you go... 10,000 Jenny.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.440
Thank you, step right up!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.780
Okay, clasp hands.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.160
Just follow my instructions.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.920
Are you ready?

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.580
You get a single round!

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.080
Ready...

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.040
Go!

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.690
Uh-oh!

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.470
Will he do it?

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.030
You almost have it...

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.540
Hang in there!

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.770
Oh, so close!

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.160
Damn, I lost to a little kid...

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.660
Next, please.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.590
Ready... Go!

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.670
I get it.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240
So this is how conditional
auctioning works.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.920
But to reach 8.9 billion,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.700
we're going to need 889,999 wins.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.460
Damn...

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.920
And you lose!

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.430
Next, please.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.580
You lose!

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.030
He's beaten a hundred and fifty people!

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.220
He's gotta be running out of steam.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.780
He looks tired,
and he's sweating hard.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.820
Don't lose before I get my turn!

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.250
I feel bad about tricking everyone.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.710
I'm even breaking out in a cold sweat

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.330
at the idea of making so
much money so easily.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.900
Okay, next person, please.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.990
Well, we have our first
female challenger!

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.840
All right! Get him, girl!

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.420
Go easy on her, muscle boy!

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.590
How old are you?

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.350
Where are you from?

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.350
Huh? You're no fun.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.460
Let's have a fair contest.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.310
Oh, yes.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.900
Ready... Go!

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.580
Oh, too bad! You lose!

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:13.980
Good job, girl!

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.520
Thank you very much.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.470
Oh, you're welcome.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.990
A pity.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.210
That was your full strength, wasn't it?

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:24.910
Yeah...

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.210
I wonder who she is...

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.990
The world champion arm wrestler?

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:33.670
Well?

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.150
I lost.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:36.610
He's strong.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.450
That little boy?

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.170
I sort of wanted that diamond.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.430
You should've used your left hand.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.180
Yes, why didn't you use
your stronger hand?

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.840
Oh, right...

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.460
He extended his right hand,
so I did the same.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.190
I'd like to challenge him again.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.370
You can't.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.380
No time. We have our job.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.780
Yes.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.440
Besides, buying and
bidding would be wrong.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.690
We're thieves.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.450
If we want something, we take it.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.780
No way! I'm going!

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.690
Can you hear me?
I'm ready to give up...

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.160
Yes, her tantrum—

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.900
That is, her crying exhausted her,
and she's asleep now.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.460
I don't know what will
happen when she wakes.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:38.160
I vow to obtain the items she desires,

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:43.920
but her goal is to participate
in the bidding personally.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.650
So she'll be disappointed

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.930
when she wakes up and realizes
that she missed her chance.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.740
Very well.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.060
I'll adjust my schedule and
head over personally.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.540
For now, just be sure to get
that mummy princess,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.440
so we can get Neon in a good mood again.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.490
Understood.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.200
It's me. How's it going?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.450
Nothing unusual.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.110
No changes visible from the outside.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100
Understood.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.770
We'll notify you if anything happens.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.910
Still, they're being quite thorough.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.400
Only Mafia security are allowed

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.420
within five hundred meters
of the auction house.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.600
If they didn't do that, the surroundings
would be crawling with thugs.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.390
They're practically announcing that
unwholesome practices are going on.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.980
I suppose so.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.850
Will the Phantom Troupe

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.740
really show up?

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.490
Hmm?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.740
That's the same sound I heard earlier.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.120
You see,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.500
I happened to see you
leaving the Hunter agency.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.010
When you walked past me,

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.820
your heart was playing a melody of rage.

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.080
May I ask you a question?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.010
Yes.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.940
Scarlet eyes.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.980
Exactly what...

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.520
do they mean to you?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.280
Why do you ask?

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.100
No real reason.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.020
Curiosity?

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:41.540
When you saw the image
on the data card,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.470
your heartbeat was even more fearsome.

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.330
It played a melody of boundless fury.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.250
I suppose that I can't lie...

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.660
I am a Kurta.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.090
Our eyes are normally brown,

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.330
but they're red when we're excited.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.310
So I wear black contacts
to avoid discovery.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.220
I am searching

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.910
for the eyes taken from my brethren.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.080
I'll do whatever it takes to
return their eyes to them.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.090
Will you report this to Dalzollene?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:29.200
I will not.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.190
I do not wish to be killed.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.290
You could read my intention?

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.440
A heartbeat is always honest.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.840
When you began to confess
your true nature to me,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.840
your heartbeat was calm, but frigid.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.810
The heartbeat of one

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.710
who is prepared to kill.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.860
Your heart said that, though you would hold
no grudges, I was fair game if I talked.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.400
Why did you take this job?

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.860
Why do you ask?

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.410
I'll probably lie.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.630
I'll know if you're lying by your eyes.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.300
I'm also a pro Hunter...

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.140
A Music Hunter, I suppose.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.140
I'm looking for a certain musical score.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.810
You aren't lying,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.080
but you are concealing
something important.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:33.900
Well, let's just say that you're correct.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.910
I'm looking for the Dark Sonata.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.070
A solo said to have been
composed by the devil.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.380
There are four versions...
For the piano, violin, flute, and harp.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.610
If a human plays or listens to the piece,

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.460
it's said that disaster will befall them.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.210
Isn't that just a myth?

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.110
I doubt something like that
could exist in reality.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.970
I've heard the flute version.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.210
One movement alone turned me into this.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.210
My friend who played the piece died,
their entire body like this.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.420
That friend learned a single
movement from someone

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.240
who said never to play the music.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.970
That day,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.950
we were drunk and giddy.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.870
My body was destroyed, but I
gained this ability in return.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.860
However, I wish to restore my body.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.950
I'm willing to do anything.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.240
I don't want anyone else
to end up like me.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.580
So I'll find the score and destroy it.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.040
I chose this job because

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.410
it will be more efficient to
work from the underworld.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.010
It's time.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.830
The underworld auction is about to start.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.510
It's time.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.700
Yes.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.660
The Phantom Troupe prepares
to bare its fangs.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.860
How will Kurapika, now a
Nostrade Family bodyguard,

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.580
deal with them?

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.530
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.460
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:15.420
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.240
Today, we introduce Basho!

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.780
A Hunter hired as one
of Neon's bodyguards.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.700
Watch for his Great Haikuist technique,

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.250
which manifests any haiku he recites.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.460
His hobby is writing haiku,
a form of poetry from his home.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.440
I'll try one.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.110
"This segment is a

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.640
test of the heart and soul."

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.670
Too many syllables!

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.590
Next time: A x Shocking x Tragedy.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:27.260
Shocking!

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.760
Shocking?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.350
Shocker!
