00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.330
Here I come,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.110
Gon!

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.360
Bring it!

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.950
Ko!

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.760
Gon!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.870
Are you okay?!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.610
I'm just fine!

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.770
The hell you are...

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.550
I used <i>Ko</i> to harden my arms and head,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.020
but my legs couldn't take the impact.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.900
However,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.690
next time,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.730
I'll catch it!

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.030
Guts x And x Courage

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.170
An intense dodgeball match has begun.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.340
Gon was injured by Razor's throw,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.080
but his eyes burn with fire.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.920
Estimating the ball's likely drop point...

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.360
Play will resume with Team Gon's
inside players controlling the ball.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.480
But as the ceiling is considered
an extension of the floor,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.680
Gon is out.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750
I'm going to use Back.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.810
But you're...

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.190
I'm doing it!

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.690
He won't listen to us...

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.190
Fine... However!

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.830
Don't use Back until we're
down to two inside players!

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.390
Got it?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280
Now let's start.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.330
Gon, get patched up.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.110
It isn't against the rules to keep
passing the ball like this, is it?

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.540
That is okay.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.240
All right, I'm good now.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.770
Hey!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.950
I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.130
Time for payback, Razor!

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.820
Take this...

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.840
Black Goreinu!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.690
So he can swap the black
one with other people?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.960
You got me good...

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.930
That's what you get.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.580
You're out of there!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.640
He's out, but he's still able to return inside.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.340
At least we can force him to use up his Back.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.600
And the ball is in our outside territory.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.850
Huh?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.430
What?

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.490
Goreinu!

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.450
You have an interesting ability.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.080
You should use it wisely.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.870
Hold on! What was that?!

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.120
There's no rule against passing
the ball to an opponent.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.120
And you're allowed to hit
people in the face here.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.880
So his attack was also legal.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.020
Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.260
<i>Once the user's unconscious,
the </i>Nen <i>beast disappears.</i>

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.510
As I suspected, his ability works with
his direct control, not automatically.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.080
If he regains consciousness,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.370
the black ape may begin inside the court.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.660
I don't anticipate that happening, though.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.020
If the interior players are reduced
to zero before Goreinu wakes up,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.670
the match will be decided.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.300
It's impossible...

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.920
Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.180
to remake his <i>Nen</i> beast right away.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.560
Inside the court, it's three versus three.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.060
But we're obviously outmatched.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.820
Half our players are gone,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.490
and we only have one
injured kid on the outside.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.450
Our opponents have a solid outside team,
so they can attack from anywhere.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.420
Razor is still inside,
without needing to use Back.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.580
And the ball rebounded to our opponents.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.210
We're at a clear disadvantage!

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.420
Well, then...

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.340
Who is

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.800
up next?

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.420
Me?

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.220
What do I do?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.040
It's impossible! I can't catch that!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.110
I have to dodge!

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.820
It made a sharp turn?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.780
Hisoka!

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.790
Bungee Gum!

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.640
That bastard...

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.570
He got us good.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.560
He faked going for me,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.570
when his real goal was taking out
Bisky and Hisoka in a straight line.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.180
Actually, he could have

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.710
gambled that I'd dodge left.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.100
Had I done that...

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.860
Bisky is out!

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.610
Move to the outside court.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.030
What?

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.110
Didn't she dodge?

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.360
My own fault.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.370
Huh?

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.620
This means your clothes count
as part of your body, right?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.500
Yes.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.250
I was certain she'd dodged it...

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.420
We're down to two!

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.010
You can't let them get the ball!

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.260
Back!

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.760
Gon has used Back.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.510
He may move back inside.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.020
Can we really trust a kid with this?

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.650
He's no ordinary kid...

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.150
He's the only one who's even
tried to catch Razor's throw.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.760
Are you all right?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.620
Yeah.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.590
Listen to me.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.450
Do not overdo it!

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.160
Yeah.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.880
What's one plus one?

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.790
Yeah.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.290
This is hopeless.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.190
Okay!

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.150
Beat him, even if it kills you!

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.040
Osu.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.510
You okay?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.300
Yep.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.840
I've discovered something.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.930
If the ball travels outside the court,
it becomes much less powerful.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.430
Without using <i>Ko</i>, I only injured a couple fingers.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.760
Then if we avoid Razor's throws,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.590
we will avoid any significant damage.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.440
Exactly so.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.690
That won't be a victory.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:28.320
Huh?

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.230
Don't be stupid...

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.460
If we can't win no matter what
we do, all this is pointless!

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.250
You'd better cool down, stupid.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.930
Aren't you mad?

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.710
Huh?!

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.710
If you'd dodged left, you could've died.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.660
Right?

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.100
I'm really pissed off...

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.220
I won't settle for some cheap win.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.980
We have to utterly destroy him!

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.910
You must have a plan in mind...

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:08.740
Yeah.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.050
I've got this.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.630
Killua, stand over there.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.120
Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.130
Okay.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:30.750
I get it!

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.650
First comes rock!

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.770
His aura just spiked!

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.690
Rock, paper...

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.420
Rock!

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.360
First comes rock!

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.800
His aura just spiked!

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.890
Rock, paper...

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.190
Rock!

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.310
Number 13 is out.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.480
Catching the ball while touching the area
outside is illegal and does not count.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.730
Play will resume with Team Gon's
outside players controlling the ball.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.500
Wow!

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.900
He sent the biggest one flying.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.860
Damn it...

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.360
That wasn't good enough!

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.920
He looks unhappy...

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.470
He's actually upset.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.120
That kid's really got guts.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.710
Not enough yet...

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.370
Not enough to defeat the real Razor!

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.990
I need more power!

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.180
Okay, let's do it again.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.590
Give it to Razor good!

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.440
Yeah.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.080
To beat Razor,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.560
I'll need a lot more power.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.370
Ren.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:35.720
What?

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.300
His aura is immense.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.120
You may have chosen the wrong sport.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.620
He has all the time in the
world to build up his power.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.980
You might want to dodge this one.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.630
You must be joking.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.880
Focus all the refined aura

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.130
into my fist.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.280
First comes rock!

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.580
Take this, Razor!

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.540
Rock!

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.080
Paper...

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.080
Rock!

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.900
Perfect!

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.050
No way he'll catch that!

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.770
He's receiving it?

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.660
He used his own body to reduce its power.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.450
Nice move.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.170
That required perfect timing.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.330
But he was able to pull it off.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.420
This man truly is strong.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.430
Amazing...

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.610
You can do more than just
dodge or catch the ball.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.940
But I doubt that tip will help you.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.630
That ball was as strong as Razor's,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.200
but it didn't even reach the ceiling.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.450
He managed to burn off enough
momentum with that receive.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.660
Now the ball's directly over him!

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.580
Bungee gum.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.710
Too bad for you.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.010
You have to catch the ball, after all.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.950
As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:06.970
Step to the outside.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.360
Back.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.530
Razor has used Back!

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.850
He remains inside.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.940
Both teams have used Back,
and it's three-on-two!

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.280
The tables have turned!

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.810
Really?

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.490
Our team is the one on the ropes.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.400
Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.140
No, he probably can't even hold
the ball with his right hand.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.200
Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.370
He should be starting to feel tired about now.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.340
For him to be able to make another,
equally strong throw is unlikely.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.810
So Killua is the only uninjured
player left on the inside?

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.580
No, you have it backwards.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.290
He's probably sustained the most damage of all.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.880
What do you mean?

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.930
You okay, Gon?

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.230
Yeah, but we need one more... I think.

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.790
I'll put everything into this one.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.910
All right!

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.780
This time, end it.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.490
One more throw...

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.040
I can take it.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.350
Just hold out!

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.420
When Gon launched his ball,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.790
Killua barely used any
protective <i>Nen</i> on his hands.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.800
That's insane.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.490
You saw the power of that launch...

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.760
Like a cannon opening fire!

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.270
Correct.

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.540
Essentially, he used his bare hands
to form the cannon's barrel.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.640
Had Killua used a significant amount
of <i>Nen</i> to protect his hands,

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:55.290
his aura would have become a
barrier against Gon's punch,

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.310
reducing the power to the ball.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.090
In order to avoid weakening the ball,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.550
Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.970
Killua's hands must be in far worse shape

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.290
than Hisoka's right hand.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.120
Damn... I'm a fool!

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.560
How could I not be over there?

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.760
I know the technique.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.130
And I can do it faster than Killua.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:27.310
In the instant before Gon touches the ball,

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.460
you can apply a lightning-fast coat of
aura to your hands for protection!

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.570
Wait!

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.070
Time out!

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.820
Ref, I have a question.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.040
What is it?

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.250
Can inside players choose
to move to the outside?

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.120
That doesn't violate any rules,

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.830
but you can't return inside.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.850
Right... Come here!

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.720
Gon, if you come outside,
I can hold the ball for you.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.290
Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.480
I doubt he's in any condition
to hold the ball for you.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.530
I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.110
in order to protect my hands.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:18.490
I'll hold the ball, and you can
take Razor out from here.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.870
It's our only way to win.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.340
We can't do that.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.120
Yeah.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.930
Wh-Why not?

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.420
Where's the problem?

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.330
It would be a cop-out.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.280
Huh?

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.880
This isn't the time to worry about that!

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.380
Don't overdo it, pops.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.350
You took a pretty big hit.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.740
I'm doing fine.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.290
I'm not hurting as much as you think.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.260
Then show me your hands.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.610
I'm all right.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.630
Look!

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.300
He can't feel anything but pain.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.040
I can do this!

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.410
I can take one more ball.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.670
Gon, I can do this!

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.040
It's impossible!

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.660
Gon, help me convince him.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.520
I already knew...

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.320
I knew Killua's hands were messed up.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.940
Tsezgerra-san,

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.640
I'm sorry, but I won't move outside.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.000
I need Killua to hold the ball.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.120
He's the only one who can do it!

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.260
If Bisky or Hisoka held it,
I probably couldn't use my full strength.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.080
The only reason I can focus
wholly on hitting the ball

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.710
is because Killua's holding it for me.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.830
So, got it now, pops?

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.690
Go get some rest.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.370
I understand.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.850
I'm counting on you!

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.300
Hisoka, give me the ball.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.170
We will now resume the match.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.200
Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.870
Now we're even.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.750
Brilliant!

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.990
She hit him at just the right angle
so the ball would rebound to us.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.380
Number 2 is out!

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.510
That leaves only...

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:46.980
Razor alone!

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.020
Gon, we need to regain
the ball from Razor first.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:55.350
Of course.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.270
One sec.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.540
I understand. That sounds interesting.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.470
I'm not sure it'll work, though...

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.790
Oh, but I would so love to try it.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.070
Let's give it a shot, Killua.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.400
Okay.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.270
Then it's settled.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.700
Man, you always come up
with the craziest ideas.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.080
Counting on you, Killua.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.650
We will resume the match now.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.780
Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.150
What sort of team play will emerge

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.120
when their friendship is backed
by the addition of Hisoka?

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:04.150
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.130
Today, we introduce the card Contact.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:14.750
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.100
It uses your Binder to let you
contact any player you've met.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.180
What are you doing?

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.530
Contacting aliens.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.980
Wow, it worked!

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.870
Continue!

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.580
Next time: Bargain x And x Deal.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.010
Let's do this, Killua!

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.560
Are you ready, Hisoka?

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.260
Yes.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.760
Unite!
