00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Tsezgerra
Rodriot
Barry
Kess

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Today is the tenth day.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.730
If they don't return, their data will be erased.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.680
Well, I guess we have to wait
for Goreinu to contact us.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.120
Yes! I got it!

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.740
Look, I've got this down pat.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.370
Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.450
No!

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.250
You might have it down, but you're
still off by a tenth of a second.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.940
Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.030
Now start!

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.380
Man...

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.140
Another player has used Contact to reach you.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.060
Insanity x And x Sanity

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.920
It's Goreinu.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.250
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.290
What's going on?

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.060
Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.450
since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.070
Yeah.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.700
I can tell you now they won't be returning.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.810
Why not?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.080
Genthru's team is camping the starting point.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.790
We decided beforehand that they
wouldn't return to the game

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.330
until I sent an all clear signal.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.750
I understand.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
But their card data will disappear.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.200
I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.840
Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.900
They'll notice if none of the four
have any important cards!

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.450
They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.440
Yeah, in five more minutes,
their card data will be wiped.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.240
Essentially, they'll be out of it.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.990
To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.450
But do you really think they've given up?

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.790
Absolutely.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.620
Given that they took Battera and ran.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.870
It was a desperate attempt to
keep us from the reward.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.580
But they spent years collecting
those ninety-six cards.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.730
Also, I'm wondering why Battera
would send his guards packing.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.760
No idea... Guess something happened.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.030
No point in speculating about it now.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.770
Oh, it's 3:10.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.540
Time's up.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.250
Yay!

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.410
Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.030
Fake?

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.390
Yeah,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.410
we switched about thirty of their
ninety-six cards with fakes.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.470
I'm the one actually holding
the ninety-six cards.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.170
For such a cautious man, this is the
biggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.300
So I want to make sure it pays off.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.100
I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
help you face Genthru's crew.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.290
Understood.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.660
When do you want us to give you the card?

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.270
I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.190
Good luck.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.310
Accompany
Warp all players within
20 meters of caster to city
(must have been visited)
or player of your choice
(must have been met
inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.310
Now it's time to go after those kids.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.320
It wasn't in the plan, but we can
get Patch of Shore from them.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.160
First, we need more copies of Accompany.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.320
Okay.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.870
They're on the move.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.100
Where are you right now?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.650
Near Soufrabi.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.170
They're heading toward Masadora.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.330
Once they're prepared, they'll come for you.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.770
Are you ready?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.270
Absolutely.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.810
We have you guys to thank.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.650
We need more time.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.180
But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.460
Gon!

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.680
Did you let our conversation
distract you and lose track?

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.230
Please explain what this is about.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.990
I realize that I was being intrusive,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.510
but I took a look.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.910
Your daughter?

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.250
Or perhaps your granddaughter?

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.000
My lover.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.140
She'd been hospitalized for a long time.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.170
She was in a coma.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.590
A few days ago,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.130
she passed away in her sleep.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.430
I suppose she didn't want people
thinking she wanted my money,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.000
because she returned every gift I gave her.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.880
But she loved

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.480
this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.060
All we ever needed was one other.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.540
We swore that we would never be apart...

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.020
Until the accident

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.190
that put her into a sleep from
which she'd never wake...

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.560
Indeed...

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.310
She appeared to only be sleeping...

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.820
That was when I heard about <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:35.710
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.500
If I beat that game, I could obtain the one thing

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.200
that I need most, like a dream come true.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.050
I was prepared to spend my
fortune on copies of that game.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.280
But it doesn't matter any longer...

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.390
It doesn't matter...

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.370
The kids have four copies of
Accompany among them.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.540
We have six.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.670
Shall we go, then?

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.520
Yeah.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.110
Whenever you're ready.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.220
I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.870
Assuming we need to resort to force.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.830
Sub, take the slant-eyed kid.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.340
Bara, you take the girl.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.850
Accompany on!

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.510
Gon!

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:23.760
What do you want?

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.850
Don't be so hostile.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.380
We're here to propose a deal.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.750
A deal?

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.140
We aren't interested!

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.830
Right, don't let them notice

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.520
that we've been waiting for them,
completely prepared.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.070
It's not a bad deal.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.400
We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.530
What is it?

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.830
Interested now?

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.400
Stop! Talk from where you are!

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.880
Yes, that's good.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.160
We must act like we're at a
significant disadvantage.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.030
We have to convince them

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.170
that we're being forced into this position.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.670
It's quite simple.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.710
We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf,
then everyone returns to the real world.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.180
And we'll split Battera's reward.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.430
I find that hard to believe.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.730
We've had a change of heart.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.690
And Tsezgerra has already left the game.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.680
But that doesn't prove that
he agreed to your offer.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.440
You have a valid point.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.040
Then, what now?

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.440
Do you want to die?

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.830
Stop whining, and hand over your cards!

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.030
Otherwise, we'll slaughter you!

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.750
You've revealed your true colors.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.600
Book!

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.910
Accompany on!

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.920
To Soufrabi!

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.420
Three more times.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.930
Two more times.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.930
One more time...

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.930
Return
Warp to a city
of your choice.
(Must be a city
you have visited.)
[LR][NORM]

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.470
Return on!

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.440
To Masadora!

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.940
Masadora?

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.490
Are they trying to obtain more spell cards?

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.940
They might try to escape to the
real world through the port.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.540
Accompany on.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:12.160
Gon!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.380
They're not here.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.700
Are they hiding and concealing their presences?

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.530
Check at the store.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.920
We don't want to let them buy any spell cards.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.410
They haven't been here.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.960
Did they head for the port?

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.970
Tsk, guess we have no choice.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.950
Accompany on!

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:33.640
Gon!

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.910
Don't lose sight of them!

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.060
We're out of Accompany cards!

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.820
Now why don't you give up,
and hand over your cards?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.130
No way!

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.840
We'll never let you have them!

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.200
Everything's gone to plan.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.960
They mean to fight us one-on-one.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.070
If we have to hand over our
cards, we'd rather fight!

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.460
Wait, Gon!

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.840
Damn...

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.420
Good.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.470
Now we only need to separate them.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.680
Bisky, you run for it!

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.840
B-But...

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.180
Just run!

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.600
Wait!

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.600
Hey, you aren't getting away.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.550
I'm counting on you guys.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.910
You're up against me!

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.160
You know that I'm the Bomber?

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.040
I heard it from Tsezgerra.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.920
And who told you how my power works?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.650
Incredible.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.430
That moment was enough for him to know

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.280
what I'm watching out for and why...

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.300
This is the difference in experience between us!

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.970
There aren't too many people

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.690
who know about my power
and are still alive.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.800
Book!

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.090
I can't let him control things.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.440
I don't like people just taking
cards from other players!

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.950
So let's make a deal.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:29.310
Whoever surrenders first has
to give up all his cards.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.270
You seem to have the wrong idea.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.090
You're in no position to make demands.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.490
This is your last chance to make a deal.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.050
Otherwise, you're nothing more than a thief.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.180
I'd rather die than hand
over my cards to a thief!

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.430
You can kill me, but I still
won't take out my binder!

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.350
You're insane.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.370
And I don't mean my kind of insane.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.350
Very well.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.700
You have a deal.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.820
Book.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.310
I'm holding one hundred thirty-one cards.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:02.200
I have ninety-seven of the restricted slot cards.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.120
I have one hundred and two cards.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.330
And seventy-one of the restricted slot cards.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.380
Book.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.480
You have #2 and #75, correct?

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.740
Yeah.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.370
Book.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.300
That's all I need.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.380
<i>An excellent show of </i>Ren...

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.280
But clearly, he has much
room for improvement.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.920
Offense is the strongest defense.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.440
You're strong enough that

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.360
a single explosion won't be
enough to finish you off.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.120
So stay on the attack!

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.780
This kid has skill.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.170
But his use of aura is sloppy at best.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.420
Not sure why he was so confident.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.870
At this point, you're nowhere near his level.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.870
You won't be able to deal significant damage.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.020
But continue to attack!

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.230
Because he will still defeat you.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.240
You still haven't answered my question.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.380
Who told you about my power?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.070
Well, it isn't important now.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.500
My point is

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.750
that I don't need my ability to deal with you.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.250
All according to plan.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.830
Once he's seen how much stronger he is,

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.680
we'll begin to lure him into our trap!

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.000
Osu!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.120
That's how I'd like to respond...

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.390
But I don't like the idea of
being totally manhandled.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.050
I'll make him use his power...

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.010
I'll carry out the plan afterwards!

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.790
Looks like you need a little more pain!

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.260
Use your power.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.510
I have a surprise for you!

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.520
I see what you're thinking.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.140
I won't use it!

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.660
Damned kid!

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.990
She's faster than I expected.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.070
Book!

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.500
She should be out of teleportation spells.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.240
What's she doing?

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.000
She used Transform to hide
it as a different card?

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.860
Accompany on!

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.950
To Soufrabi!

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.370
Accompany?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.380
Why?

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.020
I don't get it...

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.780
Why would you go to all this
trouble to be alone with me?

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.010
One reason...

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:28.820
Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.850
Huh?

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.980
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.200
You're such a fool...

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.580
I'm telling you that I'm stronger.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.270
Damned brat!

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.900
Your attacks are too weak...

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.730
You can't defeat me!

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.540
I won't hold back...

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.990
So don't blame me.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.800
That's what I was going to say.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.630
I was being nice, so I let you hit me once.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.590
Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.620
And I end up killing my opponents!

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.730
Oh, you're alive?

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:45.170
I'm impressed.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.730
Why would you...

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.180
hide your power?

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.570
Two reasons...

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.260
The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.670
And more than anything, I hate the way I look.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.040
Too macho!

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.990
Don't you agree?

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.330
He can't hear me anymore?

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.920
I have a slight advantage in martial
skill and physical strength.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.690
But he has me beat in aura capacity.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.610
I probably won't be able to hurt
him with any normal attack.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.490
Which makes him perfect to experiment on.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.840
Damn...

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.570
I felt that hit inside my head.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.990
I can't afford to fool around.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.460
Wrong.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.760
Experiment #1...

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.350
Lightning Palm!

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.220
Lightning Palm

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.040
Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.750
But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:05.810
Okay.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.480
Experiment #2...

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.980
A yo-yo?

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.490
Let's do this.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.490
What's he up to?

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.160
What's that thing made of?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.630
This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.130
It weighs around fifty kilograms,

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.390
so it packs quite a punch!

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:38.890
Whoa!

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.400
Damn...

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.760
Between the weight and centrifugal
force, that really hurts.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.830
He always leaves his right side exposed

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.510
when I attack a certain way!

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.950
If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed,

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.870
he'll make the same mistake!

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.550
My chance!

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.530
There!

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.420
Yes!

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.050
Time to crush you!

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.010
Oh?

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.690
Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.450
Wow, you're still conscious?

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.150
Did you know that

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.360
when you kick me, you raise your
guarding arm on the other side?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.700
You're creating your own blind spot.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.590
He used my blind spot to pull
out a yo-yo and attack?

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.210
Then your defensive habit...

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.720
Was a fake to make you
kick me with your left leg.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.050
And when you released your first yo-yo...

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:01.850
I knew you picked up something to throw at me.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.720
Why did you use Accompany to
draw me away from the others?

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.980
To make you focus on a one-on-one chance,
so you'd lose track of your surroundings.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.330
I don't believe it..

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.490
You set three traps during that brief exchange?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.700
Three?

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.500
You must be joking...

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.870
Every move I made was a trap.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.910
Experiment complete!

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.280
Both work.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.130
Why won't you accept your fate?

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.500
You can't beat me.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.610
No way.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.770
I...

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.800
I haven't lost yet!

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.900
I was mistaken.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.130
I take back what I said.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:58.870
You are strong...

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.890
I will show you my power.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.080
This battle is mental, not physical.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.860
I must crush his will.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.670
His will to fight, his will to stand,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.670
his will to resist.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.510
Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat...

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:26.900
To win, I must swallow my
pride and play it smart.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:34.110
Let me demonstrate that all your hard
work and confidence mean nothing!

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.690
Here he comes.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.620
The devilish man has unleashed his true power.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.830
Can Gon emerge victorious?

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:04.110
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.840
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.700
Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:15.160
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.900
A card that can cure injury and disease.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.690
Mito-san used this all the time.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.310
Huh?

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.870
Boo-boos, begone!

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.290
Continue!

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.420
Next time: Victor x And x Loser.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.260
Ow! That hurts...

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.380
What's wrong, Killua?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.200
My tooth hurts...

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.390
Good kids always brush their teeth.
