00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.830
As Gon was dedicating all of his
power to finishing off Neferpitou,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.950
Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.050
inside the west tower, where Komugi had been.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.520
Once we're through here...

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.590
The west tower's second floor.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.030
Once we've passed this area,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.680
the King will never remember her!

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.040
As long as I don't give him
an opportunity to see her...

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.010
Flash x And x Start

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.540
Something is missing...

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.680
But what is it?

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.400
I don't know.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.990
I know...

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.840
I won't say anything.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.000
I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.990
Ideally, he should stay as he is now.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.850
I have

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.310
a feeling that something is
missing from this place.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.860
Though it may just be a side
effect of my memory loss.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.860
Exactly...

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.750
Your memory can be verified
through what you see.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.620
Which means you can recover all
of the memories you need.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.630
I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.780
Yes.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.150
However, that can be moved up.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.240
By 9:00,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.020
the remaining humans will be gathered
in the plain before the palace.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.310
What is it?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.790
I have not used my scales

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.890
on the humans still on their way in.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.060
We don't want them to cause a commotion,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.110
so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.260
What will you do, Youpi?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.700
Right...

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.910
I'll look for Pitou.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.120
Right now, I don't have the
strength to protect you.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.860
Pitou...

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.560
Did you just remember something?

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.680
Oh, yeah... We haven't told
the King about Pitou yet.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.820
Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.280
Yes,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.190
one of my three Royal Guards.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.790
I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.350
it seems a mystery that I
didn't remember it until now.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.520
So words can also trigger his memory,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.980
not just images...

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.190
We cannot let him hear her name.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.510
We must be very careful...

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.780
The key will be convincing Pitou.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.580
I know...

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.330
Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.230
There it is again...

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.240
I'm counting on you.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.240
Yes...

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.070
I...

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.300
asked Pitou

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.250
to do something for me.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.600
Youpi.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.560
Yes...

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.140
Bring Pitou to me at once.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.980
Yes.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.700
What will you do, Meruem-sama?

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.570
Enemies are still around.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.610
Indeed...

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.900
As I search for Pitou myself,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.900
I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.590
This is bad!

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.450
Your Majesty, that would be...

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.820
It is merely for entertainment.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.860
And I am sure these enemies
have useful information.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.920
However, we won't be at your side,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.020
and we don't know what enemies remain—

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.950
I want an honest answer,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:53.930
Pouf.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.510
Do you believe there is a chance

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.020
that these intruders could get the better of me?!

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:28.950
No...

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.720
Absolutely not.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.400
Th-This exceeds my expectations...

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.110
The King...

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.230
Meruem-sama...

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.200
is the ultimate being.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.790
That much is certain!

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.250
The overwhelming aura

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.090
left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed,

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.020
in total despair.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.020
Th-This isn't something we can deal with...

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.940
To handle this, you'd need an entire
nation's military might.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.610
Meleoron, we're making a run for it!

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.200
Seriously?

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.570
You bet!

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.260
We'll head back to Peijing under
the cover of this crowd!

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.950
What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.560
There's nothing we can do!

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.380
If they can see that, they'll understand.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.860
They'll run away, too.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.770
That's the only option.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.630
That isn't...

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.130
something we can handle.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.010
But if you and I team up...

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.010
We could land one attack, sure.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.140
And we could probably attach APR.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.870
But...

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:09.530
APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.020
If we're within fifty meters of him...

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.040
Do you think we'd last long
enough for him to go bust?

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.040
You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.390
The situation's changed...

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:30.270
The enemy knows about our powers!

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.550
They can prepare for us.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.030
I was an idiot.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.950
We needed to notify the Association
right away of the chairman's defeat,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.270
so they could immediately initiate
the next plan of action.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.000
Hurry!

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.320
Revenge and duty...

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.270
The difference in motivations
between Meleoron and Knuckle

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.790
placed growing distance between
them as they walked.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.080
At that moment...

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:14.040
Meruem's <i>En</i> lit up the palace and the
surrounding area in a literal flash.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.860
Sensing there were two enemies nearby,
he began with Knuckle.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.390
Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.550
that he should activate his power
when he was knocked out.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.880
Where's the King?

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.510
It disappeared!

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.770
I shall be interrogating them.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.520
Once I am done, do as you like.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:11.250
There were two other <i>Nen</i> users whose aura

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.780
reacted to my <i>En</i>.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.760
One of them must be carrying
the unconscious Komugi.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.420
What do I do? What do I do?

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.010
I must stop the King...

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.920
Your Majesty!

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.690
If your purpose is entertainment,
shouldn't you take your time?

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.000
It appears

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.460
that you have a proposal.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.690
Yes... Would you be willing

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.450
to engage in a contest with us?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.520
A contest?

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.520
Again...

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:06.700
A contest...

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.120
A contest...

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.080
A contest...

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.690
A contest...

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.660
What contest?

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.070
Youpi and I will search for Pitou,

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.620
while you search for the
two remaining <i>Nen</i> users.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.290
A contest to see who locates their target first?

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.980
Yes.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.420
But don't you need to go and spread scales?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.740
Correct.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.460
So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.020
I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.940
It is very clear

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.630
that the difference in power between you
and the intruders is insurmountable.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.500
Finding and capturing them should
only take you a few seconds.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.750
That cannot be called entertainment.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.500
Meanwhile, we must find Pitou,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.190
who has engaged an enemy that
seems capable of teleportation.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:12.300
And Pitou's current location is unknown.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.880
To make up for the difference,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.110
we request additional time,
as well as one further handicap.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.910
One further handicap?

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:24.540
What is it?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.370
You are only allowed to use <i>En</i> once more.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.740
How does that sound?

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.380
Amusing.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.090
I accept this contest.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.390
Thank you very much.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.760
Perfect...

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.460
I can use the extra time to kill that woman!

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.400
As long as we are playing,
I have a proposal, as well.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:03.660
If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.900
Yes, sir.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.490
We are very honored.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.910
And what if you win, Meruem-sama?

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.320
If I win,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.420
you will tell me what you are hiding from me.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.810
Your Majesty...

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:30.600
Silence.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.960
I already told you...

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.320
You and I are united as one.

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:45.450
Did you think that I could not sense
the guilt that you now feel?

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.530
However, I sense that your feelings
of loyalty are stronger.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:59.010
Otherwise, I would have sent
your heads flying long ago.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.330
I am certain you have your reasons.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.850
I shall not ask them...

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.260
Assuming that you beat me.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.520
You will obtain what you desire,
and protect your secret.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.490
You could not wish for better terms...

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.810
Assuming that you beat me.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.380
Meruem-sama...

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.380
I shall immediately begin to spread
scales, and not waste a moment.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.510
If we lose, we will tell you everything.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.050
I swear it on my life.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.270
You do not appear to be treating
this as mere entertainment.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.210
Once Pouf finishes spreading his
scales and returns, I shall begin.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.530
Is that acceptable?

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.520
Yes.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.160
Victory goes to whomever returns to
this room with their target first.

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.600
If Pitou should return,

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.450
you are to explain the objective of this contest

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.170
and order Pitou to hide.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:26.170
As you wish.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.830
I shall tell you that

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.790
the two <i>Nen</i> users my <i>En</i> registered

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.930
were an octopus and a human
carrying some sort of burden.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:38.900
I must win.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.880
No, victory is already assured!

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.820
The question is what to do
about Pitou and the woman.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.440
Then...

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.080
Start!

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.560
Where do you think Pitou went?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.590
It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.270
Turn around and wait by the west
tower for Pitou's return.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.090
Do not allow Pitou near the King!

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.450
You can't use clones while you
spread your scales, right?

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.480
Then you aren't buying us any time.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.280
Trust me!

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.790
I'm begging you!

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.990
Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.470
Those two are dead.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.000
No,

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.790
they're still alive.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.060
They were only knocked unconscious...

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.000
Where's Gon?

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.690
Killua's carrying him...

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.230
His hair is long?

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.300
Is it someone else?

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.590
No, those are the only two
figures in my crystal ball.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.690
That is Gon!

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.940
Something must have happened
when I wasn't watching.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.490
Where's Pitou?

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.610
In any case, don't come back here... Please!

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.030
Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.970
Are they poisonous?

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.170
It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.800
In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.100
I must get as far from my
previous location as I can...

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.800
After that</i> En <i>wave, I immediately used Wink Blue,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:37.260
and the King appeared next to Pouf,
carrying Knuckle and Meleoron.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.210
Only a few seconds had passed!

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.890
Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.960
The King could be standing behind
me at any moment...

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.240
I must hurry and get farther away...

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.580
Before the King uses</i> En <i>again!

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.180
I must go in there!

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.700
If I'm crossing the plain when he uses</i> En, <i>I won't be able to escape!

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.060
If I'm deep underground,
perhaps his</i> En <i>won't reach.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.590
But I'm also trapping myself.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.930
Should I escape outside the palace,

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.250
and hope that the King doesn't
make a move for a while?

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.180
There's no reason to expect him not to!

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.690
What should I do?

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.860
What is the right decision?

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.480
Ikalgo!

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.880
I thought you might come here...

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.370
Let's go in! Hurry!

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:40.710
Yes, but...

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.430
Hurry!

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.220
Isn't that why you came here?

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.830
If he uses <i>En</i> again, we're finished!

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.130
Where's Killua?

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.320
He went after Gon.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.750
They're together now.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.190
I don't know what happened to Pitou.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:11.470
I see...

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.720
So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.270
The King is on a whole other level.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.770
Why do you think their lives were spared?

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.930
Um, well...

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.430
It's possible that I just want
to think that they're alive...

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.540
They're alive.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.670
Probably so they can be exchanged.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.680
You mean the way Killua discussed
exchanging hostages?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.810
I'll set a trap...

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.590
I'm not going out without a fight.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.710
First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.980
A contest...

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.210
A contest...

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.760
Next time: Deadline x To x Live.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.130
Killua...

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.580
Don't you dare speak his name!

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.390
You would never understand!

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.350
Killua!
