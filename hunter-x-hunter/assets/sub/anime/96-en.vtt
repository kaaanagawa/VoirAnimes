WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Next is the continuation of
our report on the UMAs,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.230
or Unidentified Mysterious Animals,
that have recently been sighted.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.340
The difference between this and our previous
report is the increasing number of victims,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.410
and the amount of evidence supporting
the existence of these creatures.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.790
In any case, many of the witnesses are
active members of the police force.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.070
And over half of the officers

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.550
who have rushed to the scenes have
been killed by these creatures.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.920
These are images of unidentified creatures
that have been attacking the police.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.010
You can see the victims on the
ground at the creatures' feet.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.810
What we know is that all these creatures
are violent, capable of speech,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.810
and show no fear of humans.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.700
A prime example is this interview
with the lion man of Nevaska.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.950
He spoke at length of a crude theory
about the existence of a kingdom.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.480
The woman interviewing him listened
patiently to what he had to say,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.960
but eventually, she asked the
question on every viewer's mind.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.630
Can you prove that you
truly are what you claim?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.030
Those were her last words.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.570
So far, the unidentified creatures

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.120
have only appeared on the Yorbian continent.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.910
But it seems likely that they
will continue to spread,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.150
and no effective method of dealing
with them has been found.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.740
Sorry for the wait.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.990
Okay, let's go.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.030
A x Lawless x Home

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.570
They're known as Chimera Ants.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.260
I know.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.170
They became that way after mixing with humans.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.110
Working backwards from the dates and
locations of sightings and police reports,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.580
they probably originated in the Balsa Islands.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.680
Lots of strange nations are in that area.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.560
You shouldn't be talking about
how strange other people are.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.200
But they were once ants...

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.060
So they should just stay close to their nest.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.430
Why come all the way out here?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:34.990
No idea.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.660
Maybe they were just wandering, or perhaps
they were drawn to the smell of garbage.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.570
It can't be a coincidence.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.260
Both NGL and East Gorteau are nations

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.870
that share no information with the outside world.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.970
Just like this place.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.340
That makes it easier for them to invade.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.350
It's been quite a long time.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.350
The place hasn't changed...

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.110
What's the situation?

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.730
Between the victims and martyrs,
we're seeing over three hundred dead.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.120
Bombs have no effect, so we can't fight back.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.980
The council is still arguing about
how to classify the dead.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.130
What do you mean?

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.760
A few days ago, this was an ordinary human.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.710
The Ants did this?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.020
Looks dead to me.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.140
What's the problem?

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.650
Some are alive and working with the Ants.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.690
And all of them look like monsters.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.910
The council's debate is whether
to declare them dead based on

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.240
whether or not there's a way to
restore them to their original forms.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.620
They can't avenge them because

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.810
they're too busy arguing over
whether they're dead or mutated?

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.610
Nothing's changed.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.100
They always lose sight of what's important.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.080
We're going to do things our way.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.560
If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.960
Don't worry.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.730
Before the day is out,

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.800
we'll exterminate this so-called Queen.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.080
I am the Queen.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.080
I repeat.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.080
Surrender.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.760
Those who resist will be executed.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.850
The chosen will live in paradise for eternity!

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.480
Our mother's greatest flaw

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.140
was that she could only produce soldiers

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.630
through the archaic and inefficient laying of eggs.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.600
Her sole achievement

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.330
was giving birth to me.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.760
Stop...

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.190
Kill me!

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.110
Kill me!

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.870
Plenty of spirit...

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.910
He shows promise.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.550
Bingo.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.940
Chosen one, welcome to paradise.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.310
Swear eternal fealty to the Queen.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.070
I am the Queen.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:09.070
Sexy Stinger of Rebirth

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.740
With my Queen Shot, I shall control the world.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.080
Let's go through the front door.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.860
No objection here...

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.090
No one's around.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.480
Are they inviting us in?

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.840
Then I'll go this way.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.960
I'll take this way.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.040
We're splitting up?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.600
Of course... It's a race to see
who'll kill the Queen.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.920
I imagine you'd prefer to hide
your abilities from us.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.150
Kill anything that attacks you.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.240
If you kill the Queen, you're the interim boss.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.910
Understood.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.740
Start!

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.750
They've scattered.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:03.640
From their footsteps, I can sense
that these intruders are special.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.010
They are accustomed to living in the wild.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.160
Are they strong?

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.290
Yes.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.640
Then go and greet them.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.550
But then, no one will be here to guard you.

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.420
If you're worried about me,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.940
capture the enemy and hurry back.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.570
I have faith in you, Pike.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.410
Y-You are too kind...

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.240
I will serve you with my life!

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.320
Off I go!

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.080
Now, then...

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.590
You're heading out?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.140
My mother's greatest misfortune

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.500
was that she never experienced
the joy of combat.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.360
You're no fun...

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.240
Let me hold you.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.800
I'll send you to heaven.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.530
Moles.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.750
No, holes?

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:49.310
Bonolenov descended from a small tribe
that industrialization had driven out of

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.720
its ancestral lands, the Gyudondond.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.800
When Gyudondond males reach the age of three,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.780
needles are used to puncture holes in their body.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.030
Depending on the holes' size and shape,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.320
and the movements the Gyudondond
make, they can produce sound.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.100
Before fighting rival tribes or wild animals,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.470
they would play a battle song using
their own bodies as instruments.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.880
They are known as the Bapu, dancing warriors.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.590
Bapu
Dancing Warriors

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.680
They believe the more beautiful

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.040
the sound produced, the stronger
the spirit that descends.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.510
The most skilled Bapu are treated as gods,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.230
and hold more influence than the elders.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.390
Transform this melody into strength to fight!

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.560
Battle Cantabile

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.260
<i>Battle Cantabile...</i>

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.200
Prologue

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.200
<i>Prologue!</i>

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.520
The blood of my tribe,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.440
the most beautiful in battle,
flows through my veins.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.720
I swear on the names of the spirits and my tribe

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.200
that you will not best me.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.990
Was that attack supposed
to hold your tribe's pride?

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.230
If so...

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.860
You must not feel much pride.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.370
Don't bother recanting those words.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.730
They are but a beast's ramblings.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.500
They cannot affect me!

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.850
In a one-on-one fight, my opponent's
strength doesn't matter.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.450
If I can pierce it with this, I'll win.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.510
But I'm not certain I can pierce that...

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.930
Those are sharp...

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.610
I'll need to slip in between them

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.270
and insert the antenna into the joint
exposed when he moves the arm.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.770
Chance of succeeding unscathed...

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.770
Twenty percent!

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.340
Okay, it worked...

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.750
Ow.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.580
Guess escaping unharmed wasn't possible.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.090
Huh?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.250
Why didn't it work?

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.810
I put the antenna in...

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.850
You must be a Manipulator.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.650
I can tell because, once you placed
that antenna in Pell, you relaxed.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.670
That must be the condition
for activating your power.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.530
You let your guard down
when you thought it worked.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.380
Its name is Pell?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.530
You must also be a Manipulator.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.360
If my power doesn't activate after
the condition has been met,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.790
that means my target is already being
manipulated by another <i>Nen</i> user.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.540
That, and he has a remote controller.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:53.970
Oh, you knew?

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.050
Yes, it's first come, first served for Manipulators.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.300
Once I take you to the Queen, my job is done.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.050
No good...

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.200
I can't break free.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.850
Guess there's no choice.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.860
I'd rather not have to use this...

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.570
Your punch stings about as
much as a mosquito bite.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.700
What's next?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.820
You gonna kick me?

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:23.570
Pull out a weapon?

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.080
As a gift to you on your way to the afterlife,
I'll grant you one more attack.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.720
For an ant, you know some big words.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.230
Then I'll take you up on that...

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.000
And go with a punch.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.260
You're sure? Really?

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.920
Fifteen should do it.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.750
Fifteen?

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.780
Four, five, six...

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:57.440
Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.700
Fifteen!

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.700
Huh?

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.200
I get a free attack, right?

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.450
W-Wait!

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:20.460
Karmic Loop

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.460
Every time I wind my arm, my punch gets stronger.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.960
Ripper Cyclotron!

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.460
Ripper Cyclotron

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.180
Oh, half of that would have been enough.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.450
I never seem to know how much power to use.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.480
Now, then...

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.800
Which way to go?

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.160
Right?

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.570
Or left?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.280
I'll flip a coin.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.000
What's going to happen to me?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.840
You'll become a slave.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.800
You'll work for the Queen until you die.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.760
Not too different from your current life.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.550
That's true, in a sense.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.550
I'd just be taking orders from a different person.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.560
But I'd rather die than listen
to someone I don't even like.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.970
Strong words.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.810
Well, at this point, all you
can move is your mouth.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.550
I can move both hands and my left leg.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.820
That's nice.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:28.930
Anyway, ready for me to take control?

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.340
I can't let you die.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.450
Once I put this in you...

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.690
When I fight, I always carry two antennae.

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.460
For just this kind of situation.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.460
First come, first served.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.710
He stuck it in himself!

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.720
Autopilot on.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.260
S-So much aura...

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.600
Enemy identified.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.600
Eliminating now.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.250
Go, Pell!

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.660
Aim for his leg! Remove the antenna!

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.950
Mission complete.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.120
Autopilot disengaging.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.260
Powering off.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.570
Ow...

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.420
I already feel it...

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.170
I'll be down with muscle aches
for two or three days.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.720
That's why I hate using this!

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.140
It makes me stronger, but there's a hefty price.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.750
And I remember nothing that happened,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.110
so I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.410
You have considerable power for a lady.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.910
Where was she hiding that vacuum cleaner?

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.820
His thread is strong.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.370
If I get caught in it, I won't be able to escape.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.810
Where's the Queen?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.050
Rejoice.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:10.560
She stands before you now.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.010
That's a lame joke.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.680
Huh? A joke?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.060
You have no manners, brat.
This warrants a hefty punishment.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.630
They are but a beast's ramblings.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.960
Then I'll take you up on that.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.070
When I fight, I always carry two antennae.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.410
It sounds like Feitan found the Queen...

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.610
How do I kill her first?

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.830
What's this? A child?

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.830
Hey, little girl, come over here.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.030
I refuse.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.590
Rejected...

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.960
Then I'll come to you.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.300
I'm in a hurry right now.

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.230
What's that?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.350
Confetti.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.230
Wind!

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.740
That didn't even tickle.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.210
Surrounding me with more paper?

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.340
You're wasting your time!

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.840
Look.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.010
What? You think that means something?

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.260
You really are a stupid kid!

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.860
Impossible...

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.130
This rope is made of steel!

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.570
My fan is made of paper.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.120
Meandering Dance

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.120
Meandering Dance.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.130
Look.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:20.010
Your right arm is next.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.020
An umbrella?

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.150
Decent reaction.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.820
A hidden blade?

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.160
You like hiding things on you, little boy?

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.710
As do you.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.090
When an opponent wears baggy clothing,

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.920
it's safe to assume they're hiding something.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.550
What's wrong?

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.960
Are you not going to continue your attack?

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.870
That is the only way to stop my performance.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.540
You'll pay for this!

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:33.410
Pike...

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.610
If I get Pike to use his thread
to tangle up this guy,

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.760
he can't make any sound!

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.760
Next time, I'll rip you apart!

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.390
Your escape is certainly fast...

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:48.600
But not as fast as the speed of sound.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.920
Battle Cantabile...

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.280
Jupiter

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.260
Jupiter!

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.270
Crushed to death.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.410
An appropriate death for a bug.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.360
The Phantom Troupe fight to save their home,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.750
Meteor City, from the Chimera Ants.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.910
Next time: Carnage x And x Devastation.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.330
!aulliK, yalp s'teL

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.480
.noG, eurS

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.390
What did we just say?

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.210
Hint... It was backwards.
