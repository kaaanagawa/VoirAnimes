WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
Would you allow us to have names?

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.980
What is a name?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.990
It's like a code that can be
used to identify each of us.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.490
Names... Quite amusing.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.000
The King's three Royal Guards.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.370
I shall name you myself.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.050
No x Good x NGL

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.540
Yorknew City

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.540
Mitene Union

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.450
Seeking the giant Chimera Ant,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.030
Mitene Union:
NGL Autonomous Region
Republic of Rokario
Hass Republic
Republic of West Gorteau
Republic of East Gorteau

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.560
Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.960
NGL Autonomous Region        Republic of Rokario

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.790
Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.560
to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.040
NGL, huh?

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.440
They believe living naturally is always better.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.620
They may be weird for living there,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.580
but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.410
No idea what's going on,

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.580
but I've already driven in about
ten similar groups today alone.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.050
Ten groups?!

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.490
Yeah.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.380
Then it sounds like we're
among the last to arrive.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.600
They're probably other pro Hunter teams.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.230
All looking for the giant insects?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.870
Yeah, those veterans are good.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.610
Somehow, they've managed
to obtain this information.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.610
But are there really bugs

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.880
large enough to attack humans?

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.110
It defies common sense,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.750
but that voice they heard over the transmitter...

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.970
M-Monsters...

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.720
Giant bugs!

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.010
It could be some other kind of organism.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.140
NGL is one big nature reserve,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.240
so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms
that haven't been reported in academic circles.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.320
It wouldn't be strange if there are
insects that attack humans.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.350
Even if there aren't any giant bugs,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.030
this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the
existence of any unidentified organisms.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.410
As a new Magical Beast Hunter,
I need to produce results.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.580
Now that I'm here, I have
to accomplish something.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.430
According to the scouts that
went out first thing this morning,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.100
a new human village has been discovered

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.320
in sector MA18, in the southwest.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.340
There are twelve houses,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.320
with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.580
Hey, that's pretty big.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.530
Guess there are still a few large villages left.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.060
I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.190
Then I will add this village to our
list of targets for the day.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.780
Colt, could you make the trip?

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.760
Roger.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.510
What's this, Peggy?

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.300
You aren't sending me?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.000
Cheetu, I need you to go northwest,
as originally planned.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.980
Zazan, you accompany him.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.360
There aren't any large villages
left in the northwest.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.730
Even if there were, there probably
aren't any strong, young humans.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.110
It's more fun when I get to chase them around.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.110
Cheetu!

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.210
We do not hunt for amusement.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.060
We serve the Queen.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.250
We need only capture the
requested number of humans.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.350
I know that, Colt.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.220
We'll get the job done.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.630
Right, Zazan?

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.000
I'll fulfill the quota.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.650
But I don't need you telling
me how to hunt my prey.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.760
I'll do things my own way.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.000
It's fun to hunt humans when
they're running around.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.140
What did you say?

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.110
Well, there you go.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.020
Let's go, Zazan.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.840
Colt, don't get too worked up.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.400
You'll have an easier time

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.280
if you learn to relax.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.760
They dare do things their own way?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.790
At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.690
While the use of names

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.690
is convenient for leading the troops,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.180
we don't want to encourage too much individuality.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.760
Their behavior could lead to
a breakdown in command.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.560
We must take steps.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.700
I agree that something must be done.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.280
Meleoron and Yunju have yet to
show themselves at a war council.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.790
Meleoron!

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.550
Stop hiding, and show yourself!

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.650
Just to be clear,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.220
it isn't my fault Yunju is absent.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.830
You were hiding because you
thought you'd be blamed?

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.720
You're supposed to be a squadron leader.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.090
Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.180
See? I'm the one getting yelled at.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.230
That's why I didn't want to come out.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.340
It's always my fault.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.090
You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.840
And further...

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.100
I'll talk!

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.730
It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.860
He's the one who ran off on
his own to hunt humans.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.290
What? Toward which sector?

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.470
Was a new village discovered?

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.470
That's not it!

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.960
You remember the humans who fought back?

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.170
The ones who were armed with guns.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.500
Yunju was

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.940
all worked up about making them his pets.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.910
Come on! What are you doing?

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.570
I accidentally stepped on you.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.840
You're supposed to entertain us more!

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.320
That's right!

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.010
Run for your lives!

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.330
Until you're dead.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.710
This is the border with NGL.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.610
Those two huge trees serve as
the checkpoint and embassy.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.900
What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.150
These people are all so weird.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.360
Stay alert.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.640
The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is
more than a nature-loving organization.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.540
Got it.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.370
What brings you here?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.400
We're on a hunt.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.880
A quarantined organism may
have invaded this country.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.220
If you are pro Hunters,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.310
then we cannot deny you entry.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.870
Follow me.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.060
You're using computers and machines.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.250
This place isn't within NGL's borders.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.840
This area is used for foreign relations
and information exchange.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.650
Are there any facilities similar
to this within the country?

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.840
No, not a single one.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.400
No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.850
Naturally, visitors are also not allowed

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.410
to bring any inside.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.650
Which means that you'll need
to remove all metallic,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.860
petroleum, glass, or other
such goods on your person.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.600
D-Does that include my glasses?

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.620
Yes.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.600
If your clothes, belts, shoes, or
underwear contain any plastic,

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.730
chemicals, or metal, you must remove them.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.210
That isn't funny.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.790
You're telling us to strip naked?

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.750
Don't worry.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.220
There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.280
Also, if there are any bolts inside
your body, dental implants,

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:25.220
gold, silver, or silicon enhancements

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.610
that cannot be removed,
you will not be allowed to enter.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.610
Shop

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.190
Only the five of us are left?

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.670
I want you to stand by in the closest town.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.270
We'll return here within two
weeks and contact you.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720
Got it.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.290
The checkpoint is over there.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.140
There will be a physical exam and interview,

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.560
as well as metal, x-ray,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.290
and ultrasound scanning.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.100
The security is rather strict.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.250
Some people have smuggled in guns by
hiding the parts inside their bodies.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.770
It's common for people to hide cameras
or cell phones in their rectums.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.890
Some people even trained animals

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.260
to bring them laptops once they were inside.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.710
All of you are clean.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.260
Thank you for your patience.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.530
Please pass through.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.470
Welcome to NGL.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.170
Okay, let's begin the hunt.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.340
Horse Rental
12000 per day

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.600
Any sightings of giant insects?

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.990
I haven't heard anything.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.630
Even if there were any such creatures,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.060
the citizens in this country wouldn't
make much of a fuss.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.590
If we are attacked and killed by animals,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:41.340
that is simply nature taking its course.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:53.050
Anyway, we should follow the
coast and check the villages.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.610
If we go through all of them
and nothing turns up,

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.340
it probably isn't in this country.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:04.000
That's assuming those guys
were telling the truth.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:05.850
They're still following us,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.110
aren't they?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.850
Yeah...

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.460
They claim to be here

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.860
in case we encounter unknown tribes and
require interpreters or intermediaries.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.500
But they're obviously here to watch us.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.470
Well, I never expected the people
here to be of any help.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.030
My gut

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.690
tells me that it's here.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.470
Don't move.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.640
If you die, it won't be my fault.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.150
A-A mere animal shouldn't order
a superior human around!

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.990
Mere animal? Superior human?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.960
I don't understand...

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.160
How are you and I different?

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.280
Shut up!

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.680
Good grief...

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.850
Didn't your parents ever teach you

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.380
to answer a question when you're asked?

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.890
There's no hope for you, old-timer.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.310
Try harder in your next life.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.630
Now you've done it.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.270
If you kill him, we aren't able to store him.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.130
I can make meatballs to serve
to the Queen within the day.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.010
People like him irritate me.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.010
They don't know their place.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.210
I prefer to see them running around in fear.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.520
Yesterday, you shot one in
the back when they ran.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:23.810
If you'd let me handle this, I could secure
our prey in a smarter fashion.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.530
When you said, "Don't move,"
that was meant for me, right?

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.330
Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.290
Don't get too cocky.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.920
I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.220
If you enjoy killing so much, you should
volunteer for the feeding squad.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.570
No hope...

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.960
Damn that Yunju.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:19.460
Shut up!

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.630
If you don't shut up, I'll eat you right here!

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.590
Rammot!

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.840
What are you doing?

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.090
What am I doing?
I'm transporting the food.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.020
Isn't that obvious?

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.000
Be more selective with your prey!

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.600
How often do I have to repeat myself?

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.690
That human won't serve any purpose.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.440
And we've already met our quota for the day.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.850
You're wasting your time.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.360
Then I'll eat it!

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.980
What?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.490
It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.280
This is an order, Rammot.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.710
Damn.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.340
Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:24.770
Huh?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.050
I don't see any problem.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.030
I enjoy what I do.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.940
You want to take this one?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.280
I guess it's dead, so you can't.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.190
Which squadron are you from?

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.290
Oh, Zazan...

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.290
That nasty woman.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.420
You have my sympathy.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.430
You could join Yunju's team.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.960
I hear that they're allowed to
kill any humans they want.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.310
If you take this as a gift,

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.190
they'll probably let you join on the spot.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.250
What is this?

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.530
It's terrible...

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.840
Who did this?

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.410
A gun?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.320
People are fighting with guns!

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.450
Who could it be?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.960
Guns aren't allowed in NGL!

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.590
They're members of the NGL
underground that manufactures D².

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.440
Huh?

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.780
I don't think these wounds
were inflicted by humans.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.520
Does that mean...

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.500
I can't be certain yet...

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.330
But if the monster we seek
was responsible for this,

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.590
we won't be able to handle it
with our current members.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.740
Th-There they are!

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.280
Monsters!

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.500
Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.590
Run on my signal.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.580
Got it?

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.260
Rainbow!

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.260
Seven Spectrum Array

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.810
Red Arrow

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.300
Red Arrow!

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.060
Now!

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.190
No hope.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.520
Over here!

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.420
Are you okay?

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.660
Yes...

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.260
Anyway, we should contact
the other pro Hunters.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.120
Can you handle that, Ponzu?

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.450
Got it.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.470
What? That's it?

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.250
No, there are more.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.450
There sure are!

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.040
I can smell living humans!

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.180
What do we do, Zaikahal?

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.740
As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage,

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.190
they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.200
A storm brews in NGL.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.680
And Gon's group is heading straight for it.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.320
Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:25.180
Gon, what's wrong?

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.210
Do you have a fever?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.730
What? A crick in your back?

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.490
Terrible...
