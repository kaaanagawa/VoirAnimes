00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.440
<i>Ten</i>.

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.790
The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.980
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.830
<i>Zetsu</i>.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.190
A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.260
A technique to create an
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.510 line:20%
Act

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.160

The release of your <i>Nen</i> aura,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.510
after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.810
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.020 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.770
Sorry, Wing-san.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.480
But I'm itching to fight right now!

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.490
Fierce x And x Ferocious

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.480
Gon is in his first 200s match,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.160
but he's been caught off guard
by the unexpected nature

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.820
of his opponent's attack.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.670
He's been hit from behind by another top!

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.930
Gon is in big trouble,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.650
after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.620
Clean hit and knockdown!

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.850
Two points!

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.580
Gido has already earned four points!

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.450
Can you continue?

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.220
You bet!

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.340
There are too many tops for me to track.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.220
Damn...

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.220
What should I do?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.310
M-Master...

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.310
Is he using <i>Nen</i>?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.450
Yes, that is a form of <i>Hatsu</i>.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.730
He's projecting his aura into the tops.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.160
That allows the tops

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.160
to move with more strength and
speed than normally possible.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.930
Manipulating a small object requires
only a small amount of aura.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.250
A large object requires a
larger amount of aura.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.000
Gido is also using <i>Nen</i> in other ways here.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.690
Those tops couldn't be so strong

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.010
were he simply using his aura to spin them.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.530
It can only be accomplished

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.680
because he cares deeply about his tops.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.190
Objects respond well

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.980
to those who are compatible.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.360
I can't follow them with my eyes.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.200
</i>Nen<i> is powering the tops!

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.860
I can sense it.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.450
Yeah, I can sense them.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.040
My </i>Ten<i> is fading!

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.270
Another direct hit!

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.300
Gon is completely helpless!

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.770
He's been knocked out of the ring!

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.320
The score is now 6-0!

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.610
He's dug himself a big hole!

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.520
It won't work...

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.830
If I focus on sensing the tops,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.800
my </i>Ten<i> shroud will dissolve.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.010
What should I do?

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.150
A top was knocked outside the ring?

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.290
But it isn't attacking me...

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.800
What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.030
Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.820
If you're not in the ring within a ten-count,
I'll rule you the loser!

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.540
One!

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.940
Now that I think about it,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.460
the </i>Nen<i> in this top didn't feel hostile.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.430
What about the others?

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.260
They're spinning around,
bumping into each other.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.560
Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.790
Four!

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.950
Why are you standing outside the ring?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.810
If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:35.540
Five!

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.740
Just as I thought...

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.820
This is like a game of sumo tops!

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.430
It's impossible to command tops
to move with precision.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.700
It's likely Gido simply commands the tops

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.700
to strike anything in their way.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.140
They spin around, striking whatever

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.960
happens to cross their paths.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.240
Seven!

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.590
In that case, I don't need to fear the tops.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.140
I can ignore the tops, and attack him!

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.360
Heh, you may have figured out my tops,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.810
but you still can't land an attack!

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.960
There it is!

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.980
Gido's special technique,
combining offense and defense!

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.690
<i>Tornado Top!</i>

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.030 line:20%
Tornado Top

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.860
He lands a strong counter on Gon!

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.370
Three points!

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.030
The judge has awarded a
critical hit and knockdown!

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.500
Gido has nine points!

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.100
Gon is on the verge of losing!

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.960
I turn myself into a top to protect myself,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.760
while using my Dancing Tops to attack.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.660
My strategy might be boring,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.350
but it's effective for racking up points.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.820
There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.160
You can attack him until

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.860
he tires, and his <i>Ten</i> begins to fade.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.230
You can use <i>Hatsu</i> that overpowers his defense.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.740
Both methods require a large amount of aura.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.640
However, Gon-kun doesn't know <i>Ren</i>,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.370
the technique to instantly generate aura.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.870
Learning how to quickly
create large amounts of aura,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.030
and how to channel it into attacks,

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.380
requires endless training and
combat experience to learn.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.380
He'd need five more years
before he could fight Gido.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.330
I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.750
What should I do?

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.760
What will it take to prolong this match?

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.500
If he scores one more point, it's over.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.300
But I want to keep fighting.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.910
What can I do right now?

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.660
That would be...

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:55.660
Gon!

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.420
He released his </i>Ten<i>?

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.320
That's reckless!

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.070
But he didn't simply release it.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.180
That's...

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.380
Zetsu...

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.280
The technique for concealing your presence!

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.020
Your aura also disappears because
your micropyles are sealed.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.910
Any aura that normally escapes
your body is also nullified,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.570
so he has no </i>Nen<i> protection!

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.440
I didn't teach him </i>Zetsu<i> use!

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.030
Did he learn it on his own, before we met?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.280
In that case, he wouldn't realize
that this is </i>Zetsu<i>.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.770
He must have learned it while

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.770
attempting to track a beast or other target...

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.520
The boy certainly has incredible potential.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.030
But why would he use it now,
in this situation?

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.380
Idiot!

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.730
If you're hit by a <i>Nen</i> attack, without protection,
you'll be totally messed up!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.580
I know that.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.200
But in order to track the tops' complex
pathing with only sensations to go on,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.810
I must focus all my senses...

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.720
Could it be that

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.710
he never expected to win?

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.490
He's risking his life...

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.060
Risking his life to train?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.340
You don't want to live, kid?

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.840
Then I'll help you die!

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.260
What?!

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.020
Amazing!

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.020
It's the first time Gon has managed
to evade an attack!

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.790
I can feel them...

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.020
I know where they're heading!

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.920
This is all I can do right now...

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.810
Concentrate on dodging
my opponent's attacks!

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.410
I can still fight!

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.580
Your right radius and ulna were both broken.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.150
Fractured humerus.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.200
Three broken ribs.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.410
Twelve other minor fractures.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.150
Four months before you're
completely healed up.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.420
You moron!

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.700
Sorry.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.770
An apology won't help!

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.810
Do you have any brains in there?

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.100
Didn't you see what happened
to those who'd suffered

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.930
the traditional <i>Nen</i> greeting?

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.810
One wrong move, and you could
have ended up like them!

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.180
You're lucky not to be

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.720
hurt any worse.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.770
Man, why do you think
Four-Eyes was training us?

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.190
Still...

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440
I had a feeling I'd be okay.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.390
I took a few hits,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.990
but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long
as he missed my vital spots...

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.000
Come in.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.350
Four-Eyes!

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.680
Uh, sorry...

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.440
An apology won't help!

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.440
What were you thinking?!

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.060
Didn't you see those who'd suffered
the traditional <i>Nen</i> greeting?

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.830
You could have ended up just like them!

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.750
Oh, that's what I just told him.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.370
Honestly...

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.340
I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.340
Wing-san, I really am sorry.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.720
No, I won't let this one slide.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.990
Killua-kun,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.070
do you know when Gon-kun will
have recovered completely?

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.020
The doctor said it would take two months.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.020
I understand.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.810
Thank you, Killua.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.730
In that case,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.890
I won't allow you to participate in
any matches for two months!

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.240
I won't allow you to train in,
or study about, <i>Nen</i>.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.400
If you don't abide by these rules,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.270
I will never teach you again.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.240
Well?

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.440
I understand. I'll do as you say.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.740
Give me your left hand.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.840
This is a promise thread.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.790
It will be a visual reminder of your promise.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:07.640
Killua-kun, a moment, please.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.270
Killua-kun,

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.020
what is the true objective
you two are pursuing?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.650
Well, we don't really have an objective.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.900
Before running into Zushi and you,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.160
my plan was to earn some quick cash.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.590
Gon's here to train hard,
so he can defeat a guy named Hisoka.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:30.830
That's it, really.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.170
Looks like the others in the 200s
want to reach the top floor.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.190
Battle Olympia, was it?

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.930
I'm not too interested.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.780
Oh, Gon is...

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.140
Well, I'm not sure...

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:51.430
He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.630
But after seeing his match yesterday,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.940
I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.970
How long will this exchange continue?

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.470
There are nearly fifty tops flying
around the ring!

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:20.120
Gon is evading the frightening
whirlwind of tops!

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.270
Gido has used up all of his tops,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.680
and can only watch with the rest of us!

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.390
Not that way!

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.650
There's nowhere to run...

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.030
You say that he was enjoying a situation

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.400
that could have cost him his life?

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.890
Yeah.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:54.480
I know because I've felt the same way.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.540
Although I take circumstances
into consideration, too.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.260
Once he's in the zone,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.210
he loses sight of everything else.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.960
Oh!

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.800
But he isn't the type to break a
promise twice, so you needn't worry.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.870
Perhaps I have...

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.810
It's too late.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.560
Because Gon and I already know.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.870
If you regret teaching us
and decide to back out,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.520
we'll find someone else,
or we'll learn it ourselves.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.080
You don't have to feel responsible.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.280
My brother and Hisoka can both use <i>Nen</i>,

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.520
so Gon and I were bound to
discover it eventually.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.720
I understand.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.840
And I mean to finish what I started.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.340
There are many things I must tell you.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.090
Zushi is waiting in my lodge.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.490
You can train with him.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.370
No, I'll pass.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.360
Huh?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.110
I won't leave Gon behind.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.130
If he keeps his promise,
I'll start training when he does.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.860
Tell Gon-kun this...

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.620
I will allow him to practice the other "Nen"!

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.900
Tell him to practice "Ten" daily!

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.530
Hey, Gon.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.200
Master...

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.780
I may have

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.730
awakened an incredible beast...

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.250
Master?

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.650
What do you mean?

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.390
You found the agency on your own,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.440
so you must be sharp.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.440
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.640
I have no problem with your lack of experience.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.320
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.490
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.930
What do you mean?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.720
I said that I have a Hunter License!

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.420
But your exam hasn't ended yet.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.210
I can tell.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.420
What?

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.270
Can you see anything?

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.220
Eh?

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.710
Next to me.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.480
You can't see a thing, right?

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.480
Once you've learned to see,

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.280
return.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.540
That's the bare minimum.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.980
What does she mean?

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.030
What is it that I cannot see?

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.800
You can't see it, but you can sense it.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.520
Why did you do that?!

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.780
This?

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.350
Well, I was just playing with you.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.230
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.570
Consider this advice from a veteran...

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.780
You didn't notice when I stole this,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.080
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:26.830
Bastard... Return my Hunter License!

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.130
Can a newbie who knows nothing

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.340
of <i>Nen</i> defeat me?

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.770
Nen?

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.190
Wanna give it a try?

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.100
Understand now?

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.610
You still lack something.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.620
I...

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.830
I need...

00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:10.710
Enough power to fight on my own!

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:18.990
Come with me.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.210
I'll be your teacher.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.140
The real exam has only just begun.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.850
Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.160
And Kurapika has also encountered

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.780
a new power that will help propel him forward.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.240
and Killua's

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:15.750
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.960
Today, we introduce the Hunter Agency!

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.160
A place that helps Hunters
find work.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.500
This place helps pro Hunters find work.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.540
The receptionist must be a
<i>Nen</i> practitioner,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.130
It was hard to find the office Kurapika visited.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.750
who turns away those
who can't use <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.700
You must be able to find the agency

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.960
before you qualify as a pro Hunter.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.890
Next time: Destiny x And x Tenacity!

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.110
So who is Four-Eyes, anyway?

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.050
Hmm, I wonder who the Floor Masters are.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.620
C-Could it be?
