00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.050
Where is our friend?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.240
Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.000
He's just up ahead.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.250
We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.250
We're willing to pay any price he asks.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000
Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.100
I understand.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.360
After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise...

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.050
Chase x And x Chance

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.060
That's him.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.230
How did you find him?

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.920
Hell if I'll tell you, fool.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.820
You in the shadows,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.820
was it through your power?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.680
You didn't even use <i>En</i>.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.160
Are you some kind of freak?

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.760
I recently completed a very entertaining battle.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.450
I'm quite sensitive at the moment...

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.080
To calm myself down,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.840
I rather feel like messing up
a complete stranger.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.090
Damn.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.950
Come on out.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.300
Was my <i>Zetsu</i> not good enough?

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.570
No, it was perfect.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.980
This guy is just insanely perceptive.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.820
Here is Troupe member #4.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.490
In other words, your replacement.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.420
My name is Kalluto.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.820
I cannot tell you how my power works,
but we found him by using it.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.200
Ah...

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.370
You look very appetizing as well.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.030
Be careful.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.870
He certainly isn't picky.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.870
Hisoka, you'd better succeed.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.580
You people are so tedious.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.380
I certainly shall, for my own benefit.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.990
Are you serious about fighting the boss?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.150
Of course I am.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.870
Would you prefer that I survive,
or that Chrollo survives?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.910
A stupid question.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.890
Once you finish your job here,
you can die, for all I care.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.890
And if I kill Chrollo, then what?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.590
That would be impossible.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.150
But I'll answer your question.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.650
I would pursue you to the ends
of the Earth to kill you.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.990
I like the sound of that...

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.960
Our objective is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.580
to obtain Breath of Archangel,
currently monopolized by Team Genthru.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.390
We must force them to transform a card,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.820
or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.520
And that's where Team Gon comes in.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.090
While they may not have the
strength to win outright,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.600
they are highly likely to deal serious
damage to a member of Team Genthru.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.100
If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.850
Voucher
A voucher that can be
exchanged for Breath
of Archangel. Can only
be obtained when
Breath of Archangel
has attained its card
transformation limit.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.090
our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.110
Breath of Archangel
An angel that cures any
mortal injury or terminal
illness with one breath.
But angel only appears once.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.110
After that...

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.050
We only need Lucky Alexandrite!

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.070
And if we can buy three weeks for those kids,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.860
they'll trade the card to us!

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.890
Yes.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.000
Right, it's time.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.150
Let's get going.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.130
Cards Needed
Patch of Shore
Lucky Alexandrite

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.130
I believe I told you to come alone.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.880
We weren't able to make a decision,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.130
Cards Needed
Breath of Archangel
Lucky Alexandrite
Blue Planet

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.130
so we kept discussing it on our way here.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.050
And we've finally reached a consensus.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.890
We choose to fight!

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.890
Levy on!

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.730
Accompany on!

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:52.660
To Antokiba!

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.560
Book.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.820
Check your cards.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.000
Book!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.090
It's okay.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.530
They only stole some useless
cards from my free slots.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.370
Same here.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.010
I didn't lose anything important.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.620
Guess that settles it.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.240
We take their cards and kill them.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.410
They'll put up a fight.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.920
Huh?

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.930
I don't know what's happened to them...

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.580
But their resolve was written all over their faces.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.250
Six copies of Accompany,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.840
twenty-four of Return,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.430
nine copies of Castle Gate,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.350
and two of Magnetic Force.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.180
I spent all our money on them.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.820
Okay, then we'll meet up in three days.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.190
Use that time to earn money
and buy the cards we need.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.480
Got it.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.990
Do you think they'll come after us?

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.630
Not immediately.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.700
We now have nearly twice the number
of Accompany cards as Genthru.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.950
If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.910
Just you watch, Genthru...

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.040
This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.920
A Few Days Later

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.890
Gyo!

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.680
Too slow!

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.250
Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.290
Act the second you feel my touch!

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.890
Osu!

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.310
Too slow.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.000
Osu!

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.430
You're still too slow!

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.940
Osu!

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.630
Okay, let's take a ten-minute break.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.420
Next, we'll start Emitter training.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.950
Osu.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.700
He's building his stamina...

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.180
But in the mere two weeks we have left,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.540
I can only help him bolster his defense.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.960
We need another weapon before we can fight.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.670
Emitter training, level two.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.670
Elevation!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.550
You must maintain this stance,
while staying perfectly still,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.970
and only by releasing aura.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.570
If you can elevate around
at least that high, you pass.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.570
Okay!

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.070
That training is a lot harder,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.840
given that it's only a level higher.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.900
Naturally... Because this is
really level-five training.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.750
Five?

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.130
Are you sure you should skip levels like that?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.810
Well, it's a gamble.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.860
If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted
the three weeks we were given.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.970
If we followed the proper sequence,
he could reach level three easily.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.110
But that wouldn't do him any
good in actual combat.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.620
He needs an Emitter attack that
can push an opponent back

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.120
several meters with a direct hit.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.590
It must be that strong for
him to use it as a weapon.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.460
So you jumped to level five...

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.420
But even if he clears the training,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.480
the ability to send enemies flying
isn't a desicively lethal weapon.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.230
Exactly right.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:13.510
It's only meant to give him more options.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.890
So have you made any progress on a plan?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.390
First, can you tell me what your power is?

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.650
My job will be easier with that information.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.390
I'll introduce you to my power.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.410
Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.840
She specializes in providing
massages of pure pleasure.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.250
She'll burn off excess fat and guide both
your body and your soul to paradise.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.590
When her aura, transformed into
special lotion, is applied to the skin,

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.420
it makes your skin look younger.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.380
She can also use acupressure massage
to cleanse your body internally.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.540
Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills...
any anomaly you have will vanish!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.430
That's it?

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.110
Of course not!

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.760
She can also do chiropractic massages,
meditative massages, rolling massages...

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.440
And there's still much more!

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.970
Are you an idiot?!

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.890
That's totally worthless!

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.250
What are you talking about?!

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.780
That's the most useful power in the world!

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.090
This is why you're just a stupid old hag!

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.770
I dare you to say that again!

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.370
Return on!

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.300
To Soufrabi!

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.050
Wait up!

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.690
Was it them again?

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.940
Damn, they're getting pretty blatant...

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.000
They're definitely targeting us!

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.480
That isn't the issue.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.040
How do they know where to find us?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.150
If they were using Accompany or Magnetic
Force to move straight to us, we'd know,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.390
but that isn't the case.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.390
They're using hit and run tactics,
then making clean escapes.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.870
We immediately move to a different location,
but before long, they find us.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.080
They're using <i>Nen</i>.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.310
If they aren't using a spell,
like homing or tracking,

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:12.090
one of their members must have
a <i>Nen</i> power similar to radar.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.860
We can't defend against that!

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.840
What do we do?

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.850
We'll just have to use some force.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.800
That's one copy of Accompany...

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.730
Take all his C-rank cards.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.920
Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder...

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.490
He hasn't met them before.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.180
Then he's clean.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.440
Hey, have you heard of the bombers?

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.250
Yes, I've heard the rumors...

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.350
We are the bombers.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.830
I just set a bomb on you.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.230
I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.140
If you don't want to die,
bring me the cards I request.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.010
Hey, here's another Accompany!

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:16.650
I'll set Steal in here....

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.280
Kess
Tsezgerra
Rodriot

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.030
Uh-oh!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.020
Too bad!

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.040
You're out!

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.000
Crap...

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.470
What are those bastards thinking?!

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.640
They're camping outside the spell card store.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.670
And they're attacking every player who
walks out with newly bought cards.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.690
Contact
Communicate with one target
player (encountered within the
game) via your Book. (Connection
maintained for a maximum
of 3 minutes. May only be
broken by player who uses card.)
[LR][NORM]

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.690
This is pure speculation.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.450
But they must be aware of me.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.240
They've realized that someone new is
providing cards to Team Tsezgerra.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.300
So to flush me out,

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.450
they check the binders of
anyone who exits the store,

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.550
disposing of everyone who's met one of you.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.760
They also steal their cards.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.090
They're primarily focused on obtaining
Accompany and Magnetic Force.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:23.260
And any players that they free
once cleared of suspicion

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.100
are forced to collect cards for them.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:29.160
By eliminating suspects and taking their cards,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.930
they also cut off our supply.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.950
They're killing three birds with one stone.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.930
Got it.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.730
We'll try to track their movements.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.730
Get away from there and
wait for us to contact you.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.250
Silent Worker: Fly on the Job

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.430
They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.510
Okay, next we check their cards.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.450
Together, those three have

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.930
sixteen copies of Accompany
and two of Magnetic Force.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.320
That's a significant increase...

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.550
At this pace, they'll catch up
to us in four to five days.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.140
But we expected that.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.030
They're saying they won't move
until they have enough cards.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.920
Everything is going well.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.200
Twelve days left.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.170
It's not working...

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.070
Listen to me.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.180
While training, see yourself firing a water pistol.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.290
You build up aura within your body,
then shoot it from your palm!

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:52.190
The greater your power,
the stronger the aura you fire.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.880
You want to release all the aura
you've kept closed up inside.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.600
The total amount of refined
aura you apply to the attack,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.940
and the speed, power, and timing
you apply to the release...

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.080
You need all of those elements
to land the attack you'll require.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.260
It's too hard!

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.910
I just don't get how you push the aura
in your body out of your hand...

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.590
He hasn't made any progress for ten days.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.530
Maybe you should have let
him start from level two.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.490
We still have ten more days...

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.980
Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.300
In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.960
If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.800
they'll only be missing two cards.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.040
We still need over thirty...

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.110
We can just take them from Genthru by force.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.730
Gon would never accept that...

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.120
And we still have to figure out
how to defeat Genthru first.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.710
That's true.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.870
So is this big enough?

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.420
Yeah.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.370
A Few Days Later

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.380
We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.940
If you total their Accompany, Return,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.310
and Magnetic Force cards,
they only have forty-five cards.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.720
Now they can't evade us.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.820
Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.620
Accompany on!

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.650
Tsezgerra!

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.390
They're on the move!

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.400
They're coming our way at an incredible speed!

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.660
We move according to the plan!

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.820
Accompany on!

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.540
To Masadora!

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.100
Accompany on!

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.800
Tsezgerra!

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.970
Accompany on!

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:53.810
To Soufrabi!

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.990
Accompany on!

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.640
Tsezgerra!

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.240
Accompany on!

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.020
To Masadora!

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:04.370
Accompany on!

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.900
Tsezgerra!

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm out now.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.140
Barry!

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.870
Roger that.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.750
Accompany on!

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.910
To Soufrabi!

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.850
Damn, we only have five days left...

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.390
Don't you have any advice that
could help him break through?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.690
The sensation of aura flowing through the body

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.890
is different for everyone.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:42.110
If I give him advice from my own perception
and he makes incorrect assumptions,

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.850
it could end up hurting more than helping.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.080
How many do we have left?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.860
Seven copies of Accompany.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.570
They aren't coming...

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:57.560
Did they give up?

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.310
No way.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.060
They're taking their time to throw us off.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.530
If we run out of Accompany,
we'll have to use Return.

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:05.600
Understood.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.930
We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:08.920
How's it going over there?

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.320
Let's find out.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.640
Contact on.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.180
Goreinu.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.290
This is Tsezgerra.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.960
How's it going there?

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.180
You were right.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.530
Sub and Bara have appeared.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.190
Most likely the real ones.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.440
They're speculating that I'll try to buy
cards while they're playing tag.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.420
Which means it's Genthru and a couple
of fakes that are chasing you.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.780
Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.830
The same trick won't work again.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.580
Right now, Genthru is alone,
while there are four of us.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.460
This is our chance!

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.710
No, I would prefer better odds for a fight.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.860
We'll stick to the original plan.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.290
Here they come.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.760
We're back on the run!

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:00.930
Gon...

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.690
Time's up.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.480
Your training's over.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.480
We still have five days!

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.060
Change in plans.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.400
I came up with a plan for defeating them.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.110
But... But...

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.280
Uh, well...

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.210
I think I've almost got it.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.200
Maybe...

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.420
No, it isn't happening.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.120
And I can't use an unreliable
technique in my plan...

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.430
Give up.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.590
So the plan is...

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.880
To use this.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:29.150
Huh?

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.800
You'll have to learn this the hard way.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.030
Until you get it down to perfection.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.680
We're out of Accompany cards...

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.930
Use Return!

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.450
Return on!

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.460
To Aiai!

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.400
They're out of Accompany cards?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.270
We're finally getting close.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:55.350
Sub, Bara...

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.230
How's it going? Catch anyone?

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.620
Only one, and it was someone new to the game.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.870
Word's out that the bombers are hunting

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.130
players around here, so everyone's staying away.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.130
Could he have been someone
we already disposed of?

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.400
Perhaps...

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.240
Okay, come back.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.030
I'm in Soufrabi now.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.990
They're out of bullets.

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.770
Leave
Send one target player
off the island.
[SR][NORM]

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.770
We're finally down to our last card.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.450
If they follow us outside the game,
we can fend them off at the mansion.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.530
If they don't follow us, we just have
to wait until the time limit is up.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.530
It's perfect...

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.150
All that's left is choosing the
three to keep for winning.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:45.540
We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.540
Okay, let's go!

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200
Leave!

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.030
No one's here.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.190
What's going on?

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.690
Weren't armed guards standing by?

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.020
Sabazushi, where are you?

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.440
Answer if you're there!

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:17.980
Sabazushi!

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.450
Keep it down...

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.450
I was taking a nap.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:24.870
A nap?

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.980
What happened to everyone else?

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.260
They left.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.540
Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.240
We received an intermediary fee
and a cancellation fee.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.650
But I stayed behind because I
thought I should inform you.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.060
Canceled?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.010
Mr. Battera!

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.350
What is the meaning of this?!

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.180
We're so close!

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.020
We're close to beating the game!

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:51.210
It doesn't matter...

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.950
Doesn't matter anymore.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:54.840
Doesn't matter?!

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.680
That's crap!

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.030
What about all the time and effort we've spent?

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.370
My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.620
You can do whatever you want with the cards.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.430
So now,

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.250
just leave me alone...

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.190
Damn!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.860
What's going on?

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.050
I don't know.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:23.490
Why did this happen?

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.380
We're free to kill them out here.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.850
Since their ring data won't disappear.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:42.790
Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his
friends the time that they promised.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.160
But awaiting them was a
situation they didn't expect.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:04.070
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.840
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.080
Today, we introduce the card Fake.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:15.530
Fake
Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
But it will not count toward Book completion,
and cannot be transformed into an item.
It also will not count toward card limit.
[SR][NORM]

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.260
It can transform into any card from 001 to 099.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.230
But it doesn't count toward binder completion.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.160
And it can't be transformed into an item.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.540
Funny face!

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.250
Continue?

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.720
Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.550
Hey, Gon,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.980
want to see my special attack?

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:26.990
I sure do!

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.850
You'll have to wait till next week!

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.420
Are you insane?
