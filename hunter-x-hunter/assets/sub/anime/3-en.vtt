00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.570
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.230
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.550
We will now take you to the exam site.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.060
Isn't it great that we all passed?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.020
It's too early to celebrate.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.730
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.120
What's wrong with celebrating a little?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.320
We're making progress.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.320
Rivals x For x Survival

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.720
Zaban City

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.670
Gon and his new friends have arrived in Zaban City,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.330
site of the Hunter Exam,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
aided by the Kiriko Navigators.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.090
As Navigators, our job is to identify
worthy Hunter applicants

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.090
and guide them to the exam site.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.110
In other words, it would be extremely
difficult for someone to reach the site

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.970
without a Navigator's help.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.100
Hey, wanna try one?

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.350
It's Zaban's famous panda-frog-on-a-stick!

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.230
A true delicacy!

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.980
This brooch was excavated from
Zaban's underground palace.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.760
I bet that it's a national treasure.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.620
You know, Zaban City is quite a shady place.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.250
Prosperous cities tend to attract
all sorts of nasty types.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.490
What are you doing, Gon?

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.260
We're going!

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.580
Yeah!

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.980
I believe

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.480
that is the building.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.860
Huh?

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.720
It's so tall!

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.860
They have a really nice building.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.990
So this is the exam site...

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.000
This is what draws...

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.750
Hunter applicants from across the world.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.210
My first shot at the Hunter Exam...

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.040
Was this how Dad felt, when he first arrived?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.760
Hey, guys!

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.800
Hmm?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.990
Over here.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.640
What?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.640
Here.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.080
Wait, this isn't funny.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.810
Isn't that an ordinary restaurant?

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.280
You can't possibly mean that Hunter
applicants from around the world

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.060
are meant to assemble here?

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.520
I do.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.280
Huh?

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.030
No one would ever expect the Hunter Exam,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.730
with its millions of candidates,
to be located here, right?

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.060
That's true.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.730
Welcome!

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.550
Is the back room open?

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.420
What will you have?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.100
The steak combo that opens
your eyes to the light.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.300
For three.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.720
For three...

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.170
How would you like them?

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.440
Grilled over a low flame, until cooked.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.210
Got it. Let yourself into the back room.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.810
Wait here.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.050
Wait?

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.520
Where are the others?

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.460
I can't wait for the steak combo.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.710
Gon, that was just the password
to get us inside.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.010
Oh, we don't get to eat?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.100
One in every ten thousand...

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.710
Hmm?

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.090
The number of applicants
who make it this far.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.000
You've done extremely well for first-timers.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.720
Well, good luck.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.130
Thanks!

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.070
I would be happy to serve as your
Navigator next year, as well.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.740
What?

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.660
It appears this room is an elevator.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.000
Bastard...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.260
That meant that he expects us
to fail this year.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.330
Once every three years.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.260
What's that?

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.920
The frequency with which a
rookie passes the exam.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.990
Huh?

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.770
It's that unusual?

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.680
Some cannot endure

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.220
the exam's physical and mental strain.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.250
It's also not unusual for veterans

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.150
to break the rookies,
who consequently never retake the test.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.910
So I guess candidates are willing to risk
everything to become Hunters.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.830
But of course, my friend!

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.360
Hunters make the most money in this world!

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.580
No!

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.670
Hunters are the most noble in this world.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.750
Glory hog...

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.450
Money grubber!

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.940
Gon! Listen...

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.560
Every year, over fifty Hunters

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.940
make the list of the world's
hundred richest people!

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.980
Hunters are associated with
hunting wild game and treasure,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.280
but they are all second-rate.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.530
True Hunters work to protect
people and the natural order.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.110
Now, look here...

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.980
Once you're a Hunter, most countries
will give you a free pass!

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.410
And no charge to use public facilities.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.600
How are those benefits?

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.990
Hunters have many difficult and
important responsibilities,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.070
such as preserving cultural artifacts
and endangered species,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.590
as well as capturing wanted criminals
and unscrupulous Hunters.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.120
The fame and money...

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.180
That's why people wish to become Hunters!

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.730
Profound knowledge, a healthy mind and body,

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.930
and unyielding conviction...

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.940
Those are the qualities on which
Hunters pride themselves!

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.330
Gon! What do you think?

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.730
Which kind of Hunter do you
hope to become?!

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.950
Well, when you put it that way...

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.980
I think we've arrived.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.960
We'll continue this later.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.100
Strange atmosphere down here.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.270
They clearly differ from the
Hunter applicants we saw

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.720
at the port and in the city.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.850
Each is a master, in their own right...

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.550
Excuse me...

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.110
Everyone's really tense.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.250
Hello. Please take a number.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.120
Here you go.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.870
Here.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.660
Be sure you wear this on
your chest at all times.

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.760
Be careful not to lose it.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.630
Haven't seen you guys around before.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.640
Yo.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.680
You can tell we're new?

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.890
More or less.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.730
After all, this will be my thirty-fifth attempt.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.110
Thirty-five times?!

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.360
Well, you could say I'm an exam veteran.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.920
That isn't something to brag about.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.870
Indeed.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.380
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.530
Thank you.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.290
My name is Tonpa.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.370
I'm Gon.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.400
These are Kurapika and Leorio.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.050
Hey, are there others who

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.380
have taken the exam a bunch
of times like you?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.580
Well, I have the most experience here,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.250
but there are a few others.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.970
For instance, there's him...

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.280
Number 255,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.980
Todo, the wrestler.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.570
He's unmatched in strength.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.230
And he's smarter than he looks.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.680
On the other side, we have number 103,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.320
Bourbon, the snake charmer.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.530
He tends to hold grudges,

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.680
so you don't want to end up on his bad side.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.000
And then...

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.460
Number 191, Bodoro,
the kung fu master.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.000
He's getting old, but there still isn't
a better martial artist around.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.510
Then you have the three brothers,
Amori, Imori, and Umori.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.090
They perform consistently well,

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.010
thanks to their excellent teamwork.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.080
And number 384, Gerreta,
the huntsman.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.510
He specializes in killing

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.020
all manner of creatures,
by blow dart and club.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.130
There are many more,

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.980
but they have taken the test
the most times.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.020
Ah...

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.650
Oh, how peculiar...

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.930
His arms seem to have become flower petals.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.430
No smoke and mirrors here.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.300
Do take care.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.440
When you bump into someone,
you really should apologize.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.260
That psychopath is back again.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.450
Again?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.450
Does that mean he took last year's exam?

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.950
Number 44. Hisoka, the magician.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.760
Last year, he was a virtual
lock to pass the test,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.500
until he all but killed an examiner he didn't like.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.870
A-And they're still allowing him to
retake the exam this year?

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.490
Of course.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.600
Every year, the examiners and
test content change,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.260
and the examiners are the ones
who choose the new content.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.660
The devil himself could pass if that were
the examiners' determination.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.760
That's just how the Hunter Exam works.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.100
Anyway, no one likes him.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.530
You should stay away, too.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.530
He looks dangerous.
That much is for sure.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.030
Oh, right...

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.390
A little something to mark our acquaintance.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.720
How about it?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.290
Oh, appreciated.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.790
As it happened, I was thirsty...

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.200
Thanks!

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.250
Thank you.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.990
There he goes.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.540
He always plays the nice guy,

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.990
despite being nastier than
anyone else here.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.960
Tonpa, the rookie crusher...

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.270
Best of luck to all of us!

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.030
<i>The juice I gave you contains an
extremely strong laxative.</i>

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.640
<i>One sip, and for three days,</i>

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.290
<i>your guts will be a non-stop roller coaster.</i>

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.630
<i>You'll need diapers to take the exam.</i>

00:12:53.060 --> 00:13:03.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.140
Leorio

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.170
Tonpa-san, this juice must have expired.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.250
It tastes funny.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:19.830
Seriously?

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.200
That was close!

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.820
H-Huh? That's strange...

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:26.720
<i>Impossible!</i>

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.830
<i>That laxative should have
practically no taste nor scent.</i>

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.610
I'm very sorry!

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.960
I didn't realize the juice had gone bad.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.840
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.050
Is your stomach okay?

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:44.470
Y-Yes... I'm fine.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:49.270
I've sampled all kinds of mountain
grasses and plants.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.230
So I can usually taste when something's bad.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.650
R-Really?

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:56.480
That's amazing...

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.740
<i>Damn... I had to run into
this wild mountain kid.</i>

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.490
Sorry about that again.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.190
I'll see you around.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.740
Talkative old man...

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.000
<i>Still, there's something wrong
with this year's rookies.</i>

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.790
<i>That number 294, Hanzo, too.</i>

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.030
<i>He seemed gullible when I approached him.</i>

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.600
<i>Don't tell anyone else,</i>

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.730
<i>but I'm actually a ninja.</i>

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:27.550
<i>Huh?</i>

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.800
<i>Oh, really?</i>

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.790
<i>I seek the legendary scroll... Shh...</i>

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:37.520
<i>The Ultimate Ninja Scroll.
That is why I desire to become a Hunter.</i>

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.750
<i>I've heard that it's hidden somewhere</i>

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.530
<i>inaccessible to ordinary people.</i>

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.020
<i>Anyway, it's boring here...</i>

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.070
<i>Yeah, I guess... So, how about it?</i>

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.540
<i>Let's toast our new friendship.</i>

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.500
<i>As a ninja, I make it a point</i>

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.130
<i>to never drink anything someone else offers.</i>

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:02.450
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.420
<i>I-I see...</i>

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.970
<i>I could tell by his eyes that he's no fool.</i>

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.140
<i>One false step, and I could've
been in real danger.</i>

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.650
<i>Speaking of danger, there's number 301...</i>

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.150
<i>That guy just oozes peril.
I can't even go near him.</i>

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.410
<i>Then there's that guy I can't stand,</i>

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.410
<i>number 187, Nicolas.</i>

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.920
<i>Must've been tough to make it here.</i>

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:43.420
<i>Not really. Everything went
as predicted by my data...</i>

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.910
<i>I used historical data,</i>

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.930
<i>from past Hunter Exams,
to calculate this year's location.</i>

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.310
<i>Quite simple.</i>

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.100
<i>Frankly, I was bored senseless.</i>

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.860
<i>R-Really... That's amazing.</i>

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.400
<i>My name is Tonpa. Nice to meet you.</i>

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.050
<i>Tonpa-san, is it?</i>

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.610
<i>Oh, there you are.</i>

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.830
<i>This is your thirty-fifth attempt,</i>

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.360
<i>the second-highest number by one person.</i>

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.570
<i>And with thirty, you have the most
consecutive appearances.</i>

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.100
<i>Very impressive.</i>

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.180
<i>Please, it's no big deal.</i>

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.920
<i>How about it?
Let's drink to our new friendship...</i>

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.130
<i>But you have yet to actually pass the exam.</i>

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.920
<i>I assume that's because</i>

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.540
<i>you're too absorbed by your other objective.</i>

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.140
<i>Eh?</i>

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.140
<i>Tonpa-san, the rookie crusher.</i>

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.800
<i>What?</i>

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:43.780
<i>Well, I won't share my knowledge
with anyone else,</i>

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:47.220
<i>seeing as you hold the consecutive
appearance record...</i>

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:48.610
<i>Goodbye.</i>

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.410
<i>Bastard... Just you wait.</i>

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.300
<i>I'll break that snotty nose of yours.</i>

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.250
Hey, Tonpa-san!

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.430
Could I have more of that juice?

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.960
Must be my nerves.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.180
I'm really thirsty.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.470
Eh?

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.140
Oh, sure...

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.170
<i>What the hell?</i>

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.770
<i>The laxative he drank earlier should
have taken effect by now.</i>

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.270
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.690
<i>It's only a laxative,</i>

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:37.270
<i>but if he imbibes that much,
he could die of dehydration.</i>

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.290
Worried?

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.670
I'll be fine. I've trained.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.080
Poisons won't affect me.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.170
Poisons?

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.810
<i>He knew what was in the juice?</i>

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.300
<i>But he still drank it?</i>

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.690
<i>Number 99, Killua.</i>

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.070
<i>This year's rookies are all insane...</i>

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.430
<i>Well, it doesn't matter.</i>

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.830
<i>That just means crushing them will
be all the more worthwhile.</i>

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.340
I apologize for the wait.

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:54.360
The entry period for
Hunter applicants has ended.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.870
The Hunter Exam will now begin!

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.170
A final caution.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.360
If you are short on luck or ability,

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.680
you could very well end up

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.180
seriously injured or even dead.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.930
Those who accept the risks,
please follow me.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.340
Otherwise, please exit via
the elevator behind you.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.760
Very well.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.060
All 404 applicants will participate in Phase One.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.930
Of course, no one turned around and left.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.360
I'd hoped a few might withdraw.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.180
Wh-What?

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.580
The people in front started running.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.870
He's picked up the pace.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.990
I neglected to introduce myself.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.880
I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.890
I shall lead you to the exam's Second Phase.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.390
Second Phase?

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.890
What about Phase One?

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.020
It has already commenced.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.100
It's already begun?

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.020
This is part of the test?

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.950
You must follow me to Phase Two.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.320
This is the exam's First Phase.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.320
Follow you? That's it?

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:03.700
Yes.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.330
I cannot tell you where or
when you must arrive.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.330
You need to follow me.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.390
I see how it is.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.180
This test is weird.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.090
I expect it's an endurance test.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.280
Fine by me.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.350
I'll be right behind you!

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.490
<i>But there is the mental stress
of not knowing</i>

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.850
<i>how far we'll have to run.</i>

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.860
<i>He's also testing our mental fortitude.</i>

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.360
The exam's First Phase begins,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.900
amidst a mix of warriors and knaves.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.550
One candidate is disqualified
before it even starts.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:53.790
The total number of Hunter
applicants is 404.

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.560
Next time: Hope x And x Ambition.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.210
Time to go fishin'!

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.920
Yeah!
