WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Why?!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.440
You have it easy, Killua.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.770
You're perfectly calm.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.020
Since it means nothing to you...

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.760
Gon's cry had guided
Meleoron to the two boys.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.030
Insult x And x Payback

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm going to have to refuse.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.460
Right now, I'm not in the mood.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.830
Come on, don't say that.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.460
Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.840
Let me test my new technique on you.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.910
That hurts, man...

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.220
You don't have to give me such a dirty look.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.980
The one I really want to fight
is someone else, you know.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.910
That guy with sunglasses,
carrying the big pipe.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.360
Aren't you with him?

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.710
Then, why don't you go and find him?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.310
I know where he is.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.780
But I can't get to him.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.250
He controls smoke, and he's hidden
himself behind a smokescreen.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.750
And I can't get through.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.010
I climbed up to the roof, to see
if I could get in from above...

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.740
And I happened to spot you.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.770
So I'm supposed to be the warm-up
before your main fight?

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.270
Bingo!

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.910
I've had it for today...

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.790
Will you listen to what I have to say?

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.950
For the first time since taking
over the family business,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.720
I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.630
Dude, my technique is awesome!

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.920
Don't be too shocked when you see it.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.550
Well, you'll still be shocked in the end...

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.040
You're a self-centered fellow.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.690
Doesn't look like I'll be able to
persuade you to let me go.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.190
Bingo and bingo!

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.960
You should watch your back.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.000
What an old trick!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.940
I won't fall for that!

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.960
Your buddy told me to keep
my eyes on my oppone—

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.470
Well, the result would have
been the same either way.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.030
Should I have spared him?

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.880
Not necessary.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.750
How's Killua doing?

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.020
Hmm? He's matured.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.710
And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.050
I see.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.140
Oh, that's right...

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.920
I had a rare experience today.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.030
My time was compressed!

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.870
I must remember to ignore
half of everything you say.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.390
Okay, we should be safe here.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.740
Explain what's going on.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.240
God's Accomplice... Undo!

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.500
Shoot's out of the battle,
and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.380
I need your help...

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.120
Knuckle's going to keep running,
to try and buy time.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.630
He's crazy!

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.390
Okay, what's the minimum length of time
you can maintain God's Accomplice?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.120
The first time, I was so nervous, I failed
and had to tap out after ten seconds.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.010
But I've regained my cool.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.990
If I don't move, I can hold my
breath for at least a minute!

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.980
That's plenty of time.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.070
I just need one chance.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:29.070
Approximately three minutes
before Killua raised his finger...

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.320
Knuckle was airborne.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.550
In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest
point was his ability to run away.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.680
Once, to help his friends escape,

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.590
he knocked out a cop,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:05.170
and eluded four patrol cars and dozens
of police for a full day and night, on foot.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.050
The day he finally escaped was the day

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.250
he graduated from grade school.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.710
His stamina when maintaining top speed

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.510
far exceeds that of a cheetah.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.760
To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.580
to reveal himself and use an out-boxing
strategy against Youpi.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.220
For the most part, it was the right choice.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.650
He stopped chasing me?

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.280
If there was one thing he miscalculated,
it was his opponent's intentions.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.030
Shoot's in trouble! Crap!

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.340
Shoot and Knuckle considered
Youpi a high-priority target.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.300
But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.570
As a Royal Guard, protecting the
King was his mission.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.810
His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.930
Youpi still believed the King
to be in the throne room.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.520
And since guarding the stairway
was his assignment,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:30.100
he was convinced that Pitou and
Pouf were protecting the King.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:37.240
So his main priority was to keep enemies
away from the throne room.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.020
Since he didn't know how
many enemies there were,

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.110
the nature of his opponent's
ability took second priority.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.630
As did any enemies running or dying.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.680
They did not warrant his concern.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.680
Hey! Pitou!

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.300
Shoot!

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.200
Shoot was still alive.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.800
Shoot...

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.460
Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.190
he must have spotted Shoot.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.580
Then we aren't even worth...

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.660
finishing off?

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.790
Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.490
After having fought him with all they had,

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.990
the pair had never felt so humiliated.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.390
Are Shoot

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.110
and I

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.460
no more than flies?!

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.760
Fine, then!

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.490
You're gonna regret this!

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:19.510
In a few more minutes,
this fly will send you flying!

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.020
Pitou! Pouf!

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.080
Are you there?

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.050
The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.280
That means he and Pouf are alone inside.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.410
The King isn't in the throne room!

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.290
Say something! Can't you hear me?

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.290
Hey!

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.150
You fool...

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:50.720
You're free to defend an empty throne room!

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:57.380
I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.950
Damn it...

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.330
By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.560
he had already made another.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.280
Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.530
Shoot must have been prepared
to die at that moment.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.910
That's the kind of fight we came for.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.530
But he ignored Shoot...

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.350
When Knuckle pictured the
expression on Youpi's face

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.290
after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot
and headed up to the third floor,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.280
Knuckle realized his new mistake.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.780
Damn it.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.130
Damn it...

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.990
Am I supposed to ignore the fact
that my buddy's been humiliated?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.970
For what reason?

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.630
For the world?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.830
For humanity?

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.380
And if our mission succeeds,
I just shake Shoot's hand and say,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.540
"We did it"?

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.650
Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.140
Even though he was humiliated?

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.850
I can't do that!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.710
That isn't right...

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.410
C-Come on...

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.670
Oh, sorry.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:56.170
And while I'm apologizing, I need
you to wait here a little longer!

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:02.140
I need to punch that guy in the face...

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:09.530
And I'll throw another punch for you!

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:19.380
It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.480
"Have you lost your mind?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.190
Don't go.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.920
Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time."

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.310
That is my...

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.440
Do it, Knuckle!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.710
Damn it!

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.270
That bastard...

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.960
He...

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.970
He...

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.290
looked at me like I was trash!

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.280
Give that bastard an extra punch for me...

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.740
Yeah, I got it!

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.310
Sorry, master...

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.240
We're both fools.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.670
There's something more important
than the world right now!

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.580
Knuckle's new mistake

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.070
was a misjudgment of his priorities.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.160
My attacks aren't having any
effect on this smoke...

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.980
Your Majesty!

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.250
Pitou! Pouf!

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.280
Are you there? Hey!

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.380
Is that Youpi?

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.760
Were they both defeated?

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.650
I hope the old man's doing okay...

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.260
Why isn't Pouf responding?

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.920
Something's wrong.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.690
Why is he staying inside his cocoon?

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.350
I would have expected him to be in
more of a hurry to get to the King.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.000
Could we have made...

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.420
some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.250
Is our operation actually working?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.830
Don't think about it!

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.960
I'm here to fulfill my mission!

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.730
Doubt, worry, impatience...

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:51.030
Negative emotions are growing,
but his resolve has not faltered.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.650
Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.750
I'm impressed.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:03.360
However, that will be the constraint
that weakens your decision-making.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.360
Damn...

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.240
<i>Why is Pitou's</i> En <i>gone?</i>

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.600
Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.280
Leaving me behind?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.630
What happened?

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.000
What's going on?

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.450
It's time.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.390
Adding interest.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.380
Shut up!

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.390
The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.640
And the number on this thing keeps increasing.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.090
I have to find the King!

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.150
Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.010
That might have gotten rid of this fog.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:51.160
But I have to find the King!

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.410
What's going on?!

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.410
I'm getting annoyed!

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.440
Yo.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:23.440
What the hell is wrong with all of you?!

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.450
And with that shout, Youpi transformed.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.840
It was drastic enough to make Knuckle,
who thought he had come prepared,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.960
instantly switch from an offensive
stance to an evasive one.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.730
This manifestation of evil

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.800
clearly meant only to destroy.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.670
Hang on!

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.650
Did you...

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.420
hit him?

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700
Eh?

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.840
Did you hit him...

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.550
for me?

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.610
Not yet, damn it!

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.280
I'll hit him hard, so hold on!

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.270
But we have to run, so we don't die first!

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.170
For the first time in his life,

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.130
Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.640
This had made it apparent that

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.210
his power was not meant for guarding the King.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.720
Rather, he realized that his violent rage

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.500
could fuel a rapid increase in the
mass of both his body and his aura.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.700
The destruction brought him great pleasure,

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:37.040
after which his body rapidly shrank,
and he felt a strong sense of loss.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:45.870
Knuckle's superior experience helped him
understand what had happened to Youpi.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.370
We can win.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.600
That was a powerful blast.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.560
I doubt it'll be easy to goad him
into doing that on purpose,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.980
and make it out unharmed.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.040
But the return for taking that risk

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.110
will be enormous.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.400
I make him mad, so he blows up.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.210
The perfect time to hit him

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:18.270
would be when he's charging up.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.910
And the aura required to fuel his explosion

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.550
will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.230
The plan Knuckle formed on the spot

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:35.170
was almost flawless for dealing
with the berserk Youpi.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.300
However, Youpi's true worth only
became clear after the explosion.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.100
As Youpi transitioned between
lingering pleasure and despondency,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.480
this selfish ability that could be
called the dregs of his ego

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.480
was focused solely on how he could use

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.180
this power for the King's sake.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.440
Selflessness...

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.230
His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:10.540
continued to function calmly even after
the discovery of his burst of emotion.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.050
My contribution to the King will be

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:21.010
how well I can control this ability
without letting my emotions take over.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.510
In other words,

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:28.260
I must use it to destroy the intruders.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.510
Now that Youpi had learned how
to be both enraged and composed,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.590
the risk for Knuckle was overly great.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.300
Approximately three minutes have
passed since the mission began.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.610
The intentions of all involved
are beginning to come together.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.210
Next time: A x False x Rage.

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:25.060
Yeah, screw you!

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.320
Sorry, Killua...

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.780
I won't forgive you.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.310
Here's a chocolate robot.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:30.260
Gon!
