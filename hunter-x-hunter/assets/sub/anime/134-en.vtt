WEBVTT

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.030
We are no different from the Ants.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.860
No...

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.110
We are far worse.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.700
The rose was poisonous.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.510
The poison, which spread
when the rose bloomed,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.710
was superior to similar toxins

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.960
because it was immediately absorbed by
those in the area unfortunate enough

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.460
to survive the explosion.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.710
Rapid destruction of their organs would begin,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.460
and their bodies themselves

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.000
would become poisons that continued to
emit new poison, until the victim died.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.720
The amount of poison for a lethal dose and
the amount of time until the subject died

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.490
perfectly created a chain of poisoned victims.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.990
In other words,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.000
it was a demonic weapon
more inhumane than any other.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The Word x Is x That Someone

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.150
Th-This is...

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.970
What is happening to my body?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.650
Pouf.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.160
Is something the matter, Meruem-sama?

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.370
Have you changed your mind?

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.680
In that case, we must evacuate you at once.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.020
Your Majesty?

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.890
Even when I can see right through him,

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.100
he still refuses to divulge his secret.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.940
Very well.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.500
I only have to capture the remaining intruders.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.660
I am very curious about your secret now.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.950
You do not intend to change your
mind about telling me, do you?

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.420
I will keep my word, even if it costs me my life.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.470
Good.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.750
<i>He's already using his final
permissible </i>En <i>search</i>!

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.710
I can see

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.870
everything.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.900
I see what has changed since
the first time I used</i> En.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.300
The footprints that were not there before.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.880
An abandoned vehicle.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.310
Youpi's corpse.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.940
A door that has been opened.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.760
And someone responding to my</i>
En <i>who did not previously.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.410
Huh?!

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.030
Was it you who killed Youpi?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.260
A-Absolutely not!

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.320
I am a mere Squadron Leader!

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.670
I would never have any reason to kill Youpi-dono!

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.910
Youpi-dono

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.440
was talking to me when he
suddenly coughed up blood,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.170
became overcome with pain, and died.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.210
I swear that I'm not lying!

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.060
I'm not lying...

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.560
Yes, I did attack Youpi.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.780
But before he could answer my question...

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.190
Before my black centipedes could even hatch...

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.290
He died.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.840
I believe that he must have been hit

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.910
by some sort of attack before encountering me.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.300
That's why I came here to
investigate if any intruders

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.720
are hidden in the crowd.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.070
The Royal Guard Pouf...

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.110
He's going to be trouble.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.100
I'm pretty sure he has the
ability to read my mind.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.370
Welfin is a serious threat.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.690
I have no idea what he might tell the King...

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.500
Simply telling him to keep quiet
would be too lenient.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.510
I should eliminate him immediately!

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.340
I should accuse him of being a traitor,
and execute him on the spot.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.120
In any case, I must get him away from the King.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.830
Meruem-sama, he is—

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.050
I know what you want to say.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.480
I can now sense the emotions of
any that my <i>En</i> has touched.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.350
I could feel his unbridled hostility toward me.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:21.810
In...

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.860
Incredible...

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.940
Once someone has been exposed to my <i>En</i>,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.360
I can see into their mind by simply looking.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.800
So it wasn't just Youpi's wings and attacks.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.870
The King also inherited my Spiritual Message...

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.160
And he's made it infinitely more powerful.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.960
Your Majesty!

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.710
The King is invincible...

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.980
The King is unrivaled!

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.690
And yet...

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.550
Why?!

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.250
Why is my heart

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.040
filled with

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.740
such unease?

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.990
Now there is some fear mixed in,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:23.500
but there is no concealing
your desire to kill me.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.020
I am interested to learn

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.260
what drives your hatred of me.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.140
Speak.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.880
Lie, and you will regret it.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.770
This is no time to let emotion
get the better of me!

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.730
Tell me what you know.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.780
Meruem-sama!

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.480
You must follow the proper order.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.290
He has deep ties to my secret.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.800
However, he does not realize this.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.310
If you continue questioning him,

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.560
it is very likely that he will reveal

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.070
part, or all, of my secret.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.820
When the King has such power, lies are futile.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.190
Then I must use the truth!

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.230
I believe that you would not want your reward

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.580
before winning the contest.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.840
I will keep my secret hidden using only truth!

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.180
If you wish to continue our contest,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.490
I believe you should wait to question him.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.760
What is this guy talking about?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.720
Secret? What secret?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.040
Wait, what do I do now?

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.040
How do I escape from this monster?

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.160
Damn it!

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.120
I didn't realize he was this powerful!

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.510
I should have run away right off the bat.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.620
Temptation got the better of me!

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:28.500
When I saw the giant Youpi
shrunken down like some bug,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.590
and then he dropped dead,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.910
I actually had the delusion that I could be King...

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.300
So I stayed...

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.040
I was drunk on my delusion!

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.780
I felt almighty, like some sheltered little kid.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.560
I felt alive.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.020
Yeah, I'm an idiot! I was drunk!

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.880
Too many things happened simultaneously,
and then I remembered Gyro.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.360
I panicked and got sentimental,
and wanted to be a hero!

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.800
I thought I could avenge Gyro.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:04.070
But Gyro isn't even dead...

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.870
He's alive, for sure!

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.610
I should have run,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.430
and teamed up with him again
before seeking revenge!

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:13.680
Damn it!

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.380
It's that octopus's fault.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.630
He threw me off my game.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.260
He threw my emotions out of whack.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.280
He led me astray!

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.260
Damn him! "Messenger," my eye!

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.640
I have to do something.
He knows my intent is hostile.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.200
And I can't lie...

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.530
He'll send my head flying before
I can activate Missile Man!

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.280
What tools do I have left?

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.080
The message?

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.780
Pouf's secret?

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.790
The drive behind my hatred?

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.560
Everything that I know?

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.830
Will it be enough to save me? What do I say?

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.890
The first...

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.190
The first word I say is key.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.230
Just one word will decide
whether I live or die.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.060
If I choose the wrong one, it's all over!

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.280
This overwhelming pressure.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.770
This abnormal tension.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.280
Pouf, does that secret

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.810
have any relationship to the hatred

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.290
he feels toward me?

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.790
This is the King...

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.230
After interrupting me in the
middle of my questioning,

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:41.790
you gave me a direct order.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.300
I presume that you are prepared
to accept the consequences.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.500
I want a sincere answer.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.430
This is...

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.660
The King's new power meant that

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.430
he could probe for the answer he sought

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.690
without waiting for Pouf to speak.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.070
Despite the understanding that he
had Pouf's unwavering loyalty,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.420
the murderous aura visibly
emanating from the King

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.460
indicated that Pouf would have no choice

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:19.810
but to atone with his death if that answer
was not what the King wanted.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.900
Loyalty and hostility

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.260
were equally meaningless before the King.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.680
No one could stop him.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.050
Even then,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.730
I was already

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.500
prepared to die.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.780
I will sacrifice myself

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.880
to my own loyalty.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.290
There is nothing that I can say.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.550
Though the contest has yet to conclude.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.230
That is all there is to it...

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.020
His incredible resolve and madness

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.020
stopped the King.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.780
I am hungry.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.840
However...

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.450
Welfin immediately understood...

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.350
I am...

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.860
I am going to be eaten!

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.860
One second later...

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.350
I'm dead!

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.790
Upon learning his fate,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:24.270
Welfin instantly appeared
to age one hundred years.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.510
I want to live.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.770
That was when his past rapidly
flashed through his mind

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:39.990
and then scattered, the fragments
mingling with his present.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.480
One word...

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.810
My first

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.840
and last!

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.230
Caught between the desire to live
and unavoidable death...

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.910
One word...

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.420
The message for the King!

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.420
One word!

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.920
What Pouf discussed with Pitou!

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:07.920
One word!

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.670
Pouf's secret!

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.680
One word!

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.180
I...

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.680
One word!

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.430
...won't die until I'm dead!

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.300
As his brain cells began working
harder than ever before,

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.440
he made a choice that he never would
have in normal circumstances.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:37.880
Komugi?

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.800
This...

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.520
This is...

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.330
This is how deeply he values her!

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.910
Pouf...

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.890
This is your secret.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.910
Yes.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.670
He values her more than I feared.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.000
Punish me for my actions.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.650
No words are needed.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.710
We are one now.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.290
There will be no punishment.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.520
I never had a chance...

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.930
Yes.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.230
Continue searching for Pitou.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.770
The two captured intruders
may have information.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.340
Once you are done, release them.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.430
I have nothing else to ask them.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.960
All I can do is nod.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.960
Yes.

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.720
The opened door...

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.950
And footprints leading inside.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.340
The resolve of the two that I sensed with my </i>En.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.470
All signs lead to one conclusion.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.500
Welfin...

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.230
Y-Yes!

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.580
Komugi is in the underground warehouse
with the woman and the octopus.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.740
Your job was to deliver that information
to me or the Royal Guard.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.110
H-How did you know that?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.980
I believe the octopus was the
reason you accepted this job.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.500
There was a different reason
why you did not complete it.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.880
Is that reason the cause of your hatred for me?

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.380
So it is.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:41.730
Do not worry.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:45.640
Once you answer my question,
you are free to go wherever you wish.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.440
You have my thanks.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.400
You helped me to remember
something very important.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:02.280
They said that they're waiting in Bizeff's
private courtyard, in Area D.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.770
Gyro is the only man I'll ever call King!

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.790
You... All of you...

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:16.520
Are enemies!

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.310
Our enemies!

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.550
Is that so?

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.000
I hope you find him...

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:30.810
And if possible,

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.690
I hope you can live as a human.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.720
Netero once believed

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.700
that the King was wavering
between human and Ant.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.150
But now...

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:24.280
Next time: This Person x And x This Moment.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.590
Will you call me

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.750
by my name?

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.990
Huh? Me?
