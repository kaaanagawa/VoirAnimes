WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
Who are you guys?

00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.990
We booked this place for the night.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.860
Get lost!

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.770
We're here to talk.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.860
Would you please leave the city?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.870
Been a long time since I heard those words.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.040
Pirates x And x Guesses

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.300
Then no need for talk.
Use force to make us leave.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.550
I don't care how many of you attack at once.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.810
If you can move me from this ring,

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.470
I'll take you to see our boss.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.690
We just have to move you out of the ring?

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.620
If it's brawn you want, I'm your man.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.570
This guy's terrible.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.480
<i>He's taking too long just to
produce that degree of</i> Ren.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.670
You're pretty strong...

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.840
Stop it!

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.400
I lose... Let me go!

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.470
He admitted defeat.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.970
Why didn't you let him go?

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.020
I explained the rules.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.300
You lose if you step outside the ring.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.190
Anything else, including admitting
defeat, is totally meaningless.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.940
You kicked me, then stepped
outside the ring of fire.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.990
You've lost.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.820
Oh! Crap!

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.340
Hold on! Give me another try!

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.580
Don't bother, Gon...

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.950
You're probably looking to
use your new technique.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.580
But you shouldn't reveal it in
front of all these people.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.590
Just let me handle this.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.710
What's this? You gonna pair up now?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.970
I'll be using this.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.840
You wouldn't...

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.490
There, I win.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.240
D-Damn little brat!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.230
You made up the rules...

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.500
Don't get upset.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.760
Yeah, my bad...

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.690
Come with me.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.350
I'll take you to the boss.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.620
Eh, so your boss is in here?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.410
Boss, we have visitors.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.410
Who are these guys?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.410
They want to chase us out of town.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.160
Chase us out?

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.420
Ah...

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.600
Let's have a contest.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.050
If you win, we'll leave the island.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.520
However, we choose the contest.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.300
How does that sound?

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.810
What happens if we lose?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.130
Nothing.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.560
You'll just have to leave.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.510
Okay, let's do this!

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.410
The theme of this battle is sports.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.450
Each of these members will challenge
you to a match in their best sport.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.320
One win per person!

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.980
The first side to eight wins will be the victor.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.450
I'm up first... I'll go with boxing.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.570
Well? Who's up?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.600
I've got this.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.970
There's one special rule.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.840
You may use any item created by <i>Nen</i>.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.070
What?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.590
You can't call that boxing!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.510
Don't worry, I'll only use my fists.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.600
That rule's for your benefit.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.950
Wanna tag out?

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.360
No, I'll do it.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.860
Fight!

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.740
I know what's going on here...

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.910
There's a reason you chose boxing!

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.620
You're also an Emitter, right?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.630
We're fighting at close range,
within a finite space.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.380
This is the ideal situation for an Emitter.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.030
However, you made one mistake!

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.690
Not anticipating that my power
could be stronger than yours!

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.640
Wow! He can't dodge that flurry!

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.550
Yes, he's down! Too easy!

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.350
No, it was a simultaneous hit.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.010
What just happened?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.260
Why?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.050
These guys didn't see what happened?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.790
He used teleportation.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.680
Teleportation?

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.170
Of only his fist, with a short uppercut.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.760
His goal was to land a knockout counterstrike.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.930
It was obvious.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.590
Seems he's out cold...

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.940
That's one win for us.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.210
Damn.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.960
Bah.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.900
Reaching eight wins with these
members will be impossible.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.060
Meaning...

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.620
Okay, I'm up next...

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.450
I'll go with juggling soccer balls.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.150
Then I'm up...

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.890
Wait, Gon.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.330
Indeed, that would be wise.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.840
Okay, I'm up next!

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.960
A little girl?

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.870
Now I'll have to take care not to injure you.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.470
Injure me with juggling?

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.460
We're allowed to attack using <i>Nen</i>.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.480
Provided you don't touch
the ball with your hands.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.980
I understand.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.140
Moving anywhere inside the building is allowed.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.470
Whoever drops their ball first loses.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.360
Right! Got it!

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.670
Okay, let's get started.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:49.610
Ready...

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.970
Go!

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.370
What?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.750
That was harder than I expected...

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.950
I lose.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.650
I'm up next, then.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.250
You wanna go, big guy?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.010
You bet! Prepare yourself, brat!

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.260
Ready, begin!

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.510
I'll crush you!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.460
Oh, sorry about that...

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.650
I stepped outside the ring.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.310
Now I see... That's what they're doing.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.270
That's eight wins.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.050
We're the victors.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:34.280
Get out.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.710
And we can do as we please in this city.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.840
Damn it, you brat! Come back here!

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.320
We need to fight again!

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.820
When you saw we couldn't
win with this lineup,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.060
you decided to lose deliberately,
and gather information, huh?

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.120
But once a party has lost,
they can't make another attempt.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.780
But it's okay if we simply
switch out one member.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.100
It was a worthwhile risk.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.360
You can count us out.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:07.820
Huh?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.520
We've accomplished our original objective,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.790
keeping the Bombers from completing the game.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.480
It will be impossible for them to
assemble a team of fifteen.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.080
You should probably give up on this contest.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.270
If you end up obtaining the card,
you'll just become a target.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.850
They don't get it...

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.730
It makes sense to obtain this card quickly.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.520
To avoid potential internal conflict.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.050
Exactly.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:47.730
Huh?

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.300
You need at least fifteen people to participate.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.810
Even if you use Clone,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.690
Clone
Transform into a random card
selected from the restricted slots
of one target player. (If target has
empty restricted slots or max of
selected card has been reached,
Clone is used up without transforming.
[LR][NORM]

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.740
you can only obtain three
copies of Patch of Shore.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.500
This event was designed to incite infighting.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.000
That's what you meant.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.250
Brutal...

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.920
I had to think about that, since I
didn't understand right away.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.580
Assuming that we four are capable of winning,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.160
we still need four more up to the task.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.520
And ideally, they'd already
be in a party of eleven.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.900
Do you have any leads?

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.360
Book.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.780
Looking at the names on my list,
Chrollo's probably the strongest.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.940
But Kurapika said he's definitely a fake.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.870
Who is it, then?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.660
Well, it's probably a member of the Troupe.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:46.270
Why would a member of the Troupe be here?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.670
Maybe to beat the game?

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.430
But wouldn't they have used their own name?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.170
That's true.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.390
We can use Sight Vision.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:56.220
Huh?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.710
If this person isn't here to beat the game,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.070
they won't bother to collect cards.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:03.810
Oh, that's right.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.440
0 cards in restricted slots
6 cards in free slots

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.240
This guy's not even trying.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.690
His only cards are for food and water.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.280
That makes it easier to invite them.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.130
But if it really is a member of the
Troupe, we won't invite them.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.590
We'll just ask a few questions.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.550
Then there's no point in bothering.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.460
Since it's definitely one of them.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.830
Finding out who they are is important,
but I'd rather learn why they're here!

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.470
Are you an idiot?!

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.590
You're gonna ask them why they're here?

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.440
They aren't gonna tell you!

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.390
Yeah, I'm an idiot!

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.970
I'm an idiot, so I'm still gonna ask!

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.640
Then go right ahead!

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.170
I sure will!

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.300
Will they be okay?

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.730
This is perfectly normal for them.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:51.050
I'm off, then!

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.850
Knock yourself out.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.820
Accompany on!

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:57.990
Chrollo Lucilfer.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:27.810
No way...

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.520
Hisoka!

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.670
Well, well...

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.820
I have unexpected visitors.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:40.820
It's been a while.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.080
As I thought.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.030
You've matured quite a lot.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.930
It appears that you found
an excellent teacher.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.590
As I anticipated, you grow more
appetizing with every day.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.990
Wh-Who is this pervy freak?

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.970
Are you their teacher?

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.020
No, it doesn't seem to be him.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.270
Stop it!

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.310
She's the one?

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.050
So what do you want with me...
No, with Chrollo?

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:23.360
I have a question.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.620
Why are you here?

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.170
Well, what to do?

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.210
If I talk, I know how they'll react.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:37.250
<i>They'll do all they can to keep the spiders from the </i>Nen <i>exorcist.</i>

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.440
That would certainly be entertaining.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.250
But I have delayed my fight
with Chrollo long enough.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.260
I'm looking for Chrollo.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.020
There's actually a way

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.150
to remove Kurapika's <i>Nen</i> from him.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.810
You can purge it.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.410
So you knew?

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.660
Then that makes this easier.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.220
I'm looking for Chrollo,
to give him that information,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.910
but I have no leads.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.160
That's when I remembered

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.750
that some of the spiders were
interested in this game.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.750
I thought that maybe they would
know Chrollo's whereabouts.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.880
And by choosing this name, I ensure
that they will come to me.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.190
I get it.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.470
He was just pretending to
be a member of the Troupe.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.140
Uh-huh.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.360
Now, it is my turn for a question.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.230
You didn't come here just
to ask that, did you?

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.770
No, I did.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.010
Um...

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.420
Actually, we're looking for
people who are really strong.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.500
Won't you please join us?

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.160
Hmm? Sure.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.170
Why are you looking for strong people?

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.000
Wait, h-hold on... I'm against this.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.080
It's too dangerous!

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.960
Yeah, you don't know who this guy is, Bisky!

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.180
Oh? That's not true.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.530
I can sense that he's a kindred spirit.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.550
He's lying.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.290
We should head to the
City of Love just ahead, Aiai.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.970
It's a great place for new meetings.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.870
Perhaps you can find strong people there.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.280
What did you mean about him lying?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.520
Technically, I should say he
wasn't speaking the truth.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.890
How could you tell?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.860
I had a gut feeling.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.590
A gut feeling?!

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.030
After lying for fifty years,
I can recognize a fellow liar.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.590
That's a convincing argument.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.860
Since he's hiding something,

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.060
we'll keep him around to see what's up.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.090
Plus, he really is strong, right?

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.350
Uh-huh...

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.320
Hey, Hisoka!

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.590
You walk in front!

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.620
We need ten more members, correct?

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.080
Yeah...

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.000
We hope to find others like you
who aren't interested in cards.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.760
Isn't everyone else here to beat the game?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.260
I can't imagine there are too
many eccentrics like myself.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.630
He's definitely hiding something.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.990
By the way,

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.450
did you use someone's power to warp to me?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.140
That was one of the spells in this game.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.780
Oh, so that's what it was.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.350
You need to buy spells from stores, right?

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.150
Something does seem fishy.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.380
He isn't being honest.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.620
In other words, there's something
inconsistent in his story.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:06.200
He came here to find spiders who
might know Chrollo's location.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.300
There's something off about that explanation.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.300
City of Love, Aiai

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.770
Where are my glasses?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.570
Why not give them to her?

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.800
You might become friends.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.890
Hey...

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.580
Watch where you're going!

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.660
Be more careful.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.950
S-Sorry...

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.720
I'm gonna be late!

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:41.960
You weren't supposed to apologize...

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.940
You should have told her to watch where
<i>she</i> was going and started a fight.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.080
Stop it!

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.220
Release me! I'll scream...

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.440
Go ahead and scream.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.720
No one's coming to save you.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.520
Hold it!

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.410
Let go of her!

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.750
That hurt...

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.070
How could you fall for such a cliché?!

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.990
You want me to model for your hairstyling?

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.740
Please allow me to cut your long, lovely hair.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.110
Of course.

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.120
There's no point in hanging around this city.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.010
Hisoka, let's head somewhere else.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.640
Oh?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.000
But we won't be bored here.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.220
Bored...

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.660
That's it!

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.010
That's what was wrong.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.570
This place...

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:38.730
This place is the problem!

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.190
If I entered this game to find someone,

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.270
what would I do?

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.230
I would see how important
the spell cards are.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.940
Gon and Bisky ran into Hisoka

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.890
while I was outside, taking the Hunter Exam.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.280
That means they encountered him

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.030
while they were training near Masadora.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.520
Hisoka's been to Masadora!

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.790
Right, normally it makes no sense
for him to leave Masadora.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.920
Because most players pass through
the city, in search of spell cards.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.170
If he were truly looking for the Troupe,
he wouldn't have left Masadora.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.430
But we won't be bored here.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.580
He's bored because he has nothing to do.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.440
So he isn't looking for anyone.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.370
No...

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.230
He's already found them!

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.940
That must be it!

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.940
That's in line with what Bisky said.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.560
Hisoka already met up with the Troupe,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.330
and he's waiting for something.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.890
What is he waiting for?

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.200
That's obvious...

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.100
<i>The </i>Nen <i>purger.</i>

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.950
<i>The </i>Nen <i>purger is here, on Greed Island!</i>

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.880
Hisoka and the Troupe know this.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.540
I can't tell Gon yet...

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.210
He can't keep a secret.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.970
If Hisoka realizes we know, he'll disappear.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.390
If he leaves, we'll be down a member.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.470
And we won't know what
the Troupe is doing.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.510
We can't let that happen.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.980
Hey, Killua... I've been thinking.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.640
We should probably try to recruit Tsezgerra.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.560
Even if he doesn't join,
we should meet with him,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.720
so he'll be on our binder list.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.270
It would be good to know what they're doing.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.590
Binder? I can find out!

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.480
Hisoka, let me see your binder.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.100
I want to see if Tsezgerra

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.370
is on the list of players you've met.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:34.130
List?

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.860
That's perfect!

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.390
If I asked questions, Hisoka would be suspicious.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.010
But Gon knows nothing,
so Hisoka won't suspect a thing.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.270
Book.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.260
If Hisoka refuses to show us the screen,
that'll support my theory.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.900
There's Tsezgerra.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.700
Really?

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.680
Yes, right here.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.590
Huh?

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.630
He showed us? No way!

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.840
There aren't any Troupe members...

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.540
Was I being paranoid?

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.570
Is Hisoka actually still looking for them?

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.800
Then, Hisoka, recite this spell...

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.510
We'll do the talking.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.820
Contact on.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.990
Tsezgerra.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.310
My Texture Surprise

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.940
really is so very useful.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.970
Shizuku
Phinks
Franklin
Shalnark

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:41.070
Hisoka's ability fools Killua and his friends.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.690
Is Hisoka a friend or foe?

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:04.710
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.330
Today, we introduce the card Paladin's Necklace.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:14.710
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.970
This card can reflect enemy spells,
and tell you if other cards are real.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.460
Are you real?

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.300
Huh?

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.170
Continue!

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.550
Next time: A x Heated x Showdown.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.700
I win!

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.480
One more time!

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.720
Gon, where are you going?
