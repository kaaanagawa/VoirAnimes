WEBVTT

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.960
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.280
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.590
They are known...

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.350
I'll tear your body apart.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.400
Last x Test Of x Resolve

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.360
During the exam's Third Phase,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.180
which requires applicants to
reach Trick Tower's base

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.410
within seventy-two hours,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.740
Gon and his friends have incurred
a penalty of fifty hours.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.920
Meanwhile...

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.540
Gerreta, applicant #384,
is the fourth to pass.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.430
Total time, twelve hours
and twenty-seven minutes.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.340
Eh...

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.690
Not bad, I guess.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.230
If you hesitate on the first step,
you'll hurt yourself.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.330
Got it.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.300
Hey, Kurapika.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.040
Once we've spent fifty hours here,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.580
we'll have fewer than ten hours, right?

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.800
Yes, that's correct.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.170
That's way more than enough time!

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.410
You're a fool.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.220
What's that?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.470
Phase Three lasts seventy-two hours.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.280
And each phase is designed to weed out

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.340
half of the remaining candidates.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.980
So, on average, it's meant to
take seventy-two hours.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.590
Just more proof that you're an idiot.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.580
Well, our chances of reaching
the goal within ten hours

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.740
will depend on the remaining trials.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.170
Yeah, that's true.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.700
But when we've got a guy
who's so down on his luck,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.050
he can't even win a simple game
of rock-paper-scissors...

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.000
What was that?!

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.380
You deliberately lost a bet,
just to satiate your libido.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.090
Then you chose rock-paper-scissors,
a contest you couldn't win.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.550
Shut up!

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.590
You surrendered without even a fight!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.140
<i>I...</i>

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.270
<i>I give!</i>

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.960
Sure, I surrendered.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.900
But I only wasted a second of our time.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.270
You lost,

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.820
squandering fifty of our remaining hours.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.780
Take some responsibility, huh?

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.500
Besides, what kind of Hunter

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.910
is so bad at gambling?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.080
Shut up!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.620
You don't even want to become a Hunter...

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.540
You only care about ruining our chances.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.300
<i>And now, you'll have
the guilt eating at you</i>

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.800
<i>for the rest of this exam phase.</i>

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.330
Hey! What are you doing?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.650
Sorry about that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.780
Don't skateboard inside this tiny room!

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.440
Aww...

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.610
Can't sleep?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.410
That's not it.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.740
I can go two or three days

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.980
without sleep.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.270
Ten hours have passed, huh...

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.990
There aren't any windows,
so it's hard to tell.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.960
But it's probably morning.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.530
Most likely.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.670
Hey, pipe down.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.730
Let me sleep some more...

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.650
That stinks!

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.000
What's wrong with you guys?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.660
That wasn't funny.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.710
Bastard, you'd better not
be pretending to sleep.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.230
Damn, now I'm totally awake...

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.000
And we still have forty hours left?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.420
Oh, I thought you just had

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.910
to stick bait on a hook,
and you could fish.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.780
Yeah.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.970
You have to think like a fish.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.610
Think like a fish?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.590
Yep!

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.010
How would a fish feel if it saw
bait dangling in front of it?

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.050
Give me that.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.690
Wow!

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.050
Let me try.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.180
Like this?

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.370
You missed.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.730
Just watch.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.770
H-Hey...

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:39.010
What are you doing?

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.150
Hey...

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.460
Just as planned!

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.150
Nice.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.140
Hey, you'll tear my pants.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.130
Stop it...

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.510
See? I caught him.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.280
Yep.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.290
What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.280
I'm a fish now?!

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.530
You don't have to get so mad.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.370
It's not like I'm gonna grill and eat you.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.790
Don't mess with me, fool!

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.290
Man, I can't even take a nap.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.370
What are you smiling about?

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.880
Nothing, really.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.130
You must be up to something again.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.680
Of course not.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.850
I just want to spend

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.020
the rest of my time here peacefully.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.270
Liar!

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.820
I don't trust you, got it?

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.700
<i>The feeling's mutual.</i>

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.140
Yes, the goal!

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.470
Pokkle, applicant #53.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.240
Goz, applicant #371.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.350
Both arrived simultaneously.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.480
Total time, thirty hours
and four minutes.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.450
Damn.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.580
Old timer...

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.080
In a tie, the applicant with
the lower number wins.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.110
<i>These guys must be very skilled.</i>

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.120
<i>I would love to fight them eventually.</i>

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.690
<i>You lost,</i>

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.220
<i>squandering fifty of our remaining hours.</i>

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.070
<i>Take some responsibility, huh?</i>

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.530
Ow!

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.780
One more hour...

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.060
Sommy, applicant #118,
is the thirteenth to pass.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.560
Total time, sixty-one hours
and fifty-four minutes.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.220
Man, still ten hours left?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.200
I finished too early.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.080
Okay...

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.700
Ready to go!

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.950
One more minute.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.700
This is one long minute.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.990
Ah...

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.310
Wait up, Gon!

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:37.190
Hunter Vocabulary

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.190
Bored

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.170
Thirty minutes of running,
just to end up where we started.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.960
We should have taken those stairs down.

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.140
Shut up!

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.470
We all agreed on this route!

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.590
Man, I'm covered in dust.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.520
H-Hurry up.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.360
We only have an hour left...

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.870
We're supposed to vote on
whether to open the door?

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.940
We need to move on. So obviously,
we want to open the door.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.830
I've had enough of your crap.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.380
Wait, I pressed O.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.800
Don't lie...

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.010
You specialize in ruining
other people's chances!

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.710
Sorry, Leorio.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.650
Eh?

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.950
I accidentally pressed the wrong button.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.020
What?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.720
Oh, I see.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.520
Wait.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.980
Huh?

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.550
You owe me an apology.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.880
I can't let that slide.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.990
It's your own fault,

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.530
for doing things to make me distrust you.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.310
I don't owe you anything.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.070
You make it sound like I'm to blame

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.290
for everything that's gone wrong.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.790
What?

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.920
Have you forgotten

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.840
who cost us those fifty hours?

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.800
You're the one who made
a critical mistake.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.940
Hey, Leorio...

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.220
Shut up, Kurapika!

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.040
Stop this, guys.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.770
It's my fault for pressing
the wrong button.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.370
Stupid.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.860
I'm moving on.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:41.730
Wait, Killua!

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.690
Hey, Gon...

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.610
We're getting close to the goal.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.870
What? Really?

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.460
Let's see...

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.010
"This will be the last decision
made by majority rule.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.000
Are you ready?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.390
Choose O or X."

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.380
That's it.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.850
Am I ready?

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.380
You bet.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.930
Bastard...

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:08.830
Stop!

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.390
We don't have time to argue about this!

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.780
Please select a path.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.020
There are two choices.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.110
One path allows five to pass,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.940
but is long and difficult.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.770
The other path allows only three,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.730
but is short and easy.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.930
Incidentally, the long and difficult path

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.910
requires a minimum of forty-five hours.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.180
The short and easy path leads

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.230
to the goal in approximately three minutes.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.550
Press O for the long and difficult path,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.800
and X for the short and easy path.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:50.150
If X is selected,

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.940
two people must be secured to
the wall with handcuffs,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.530
before the door will open.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.620
The two chained members

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.440
will be unable to move until
the time limit expires.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.940
The examiners were very prepared.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:07.810
I think they have

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.700
every weapon under the sun here.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.100
Two out of five...

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.830
So we're supposed to fight,
to decide the three who pass?

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.150
Let me make this clear.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.710
I'm going to press X.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.340
But I have no intention of staying behind.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.340
I'll do whatever it takes to
be one of the three...

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.350
You're shameless.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.670
Had you not wasted fifty hours,

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.720
we could have taken the long path.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.480
Shouldn't you take responsibility
and stay behind?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:41.770
What?!

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:44.170
I'm sure everyone else agrees!

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.830
Have I said anything inaccurate?

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.360
Hold on.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm going to press O.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.860
We made it all the way here together.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.160
I want us all to pass together.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:57.840
Gon...

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.100
Even if it's a big risk,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.920
I want to give it a shot!

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.660
Come on...

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.800
You can't really call this a risk.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.670
We have less than an hour.

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.480
Gon, there's only one choice

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.510
if you want to pass this exam.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.680
There you have it.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.110
Now we have to decide how to
choose which three pass.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.140
Well, I'm planning on

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.440
two of them being you and me.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.950
<i>Heh, I've made it this far.</i>

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.860
<i>I won't fail now.</i>

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.990
<i>Whoever makes the first move wins.</i>

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.460
<i>Must we really fight amongst ourselves?</i>

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.840
Tonpa, that was dirty!

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.510
In a fight,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.800
there's no such thing as dirty!

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.060
Bastard!

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.140
Stop this, you two!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.310
Come on... Let's do it together.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.520
Before we start fighting,

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.190
we have to choose O or X!

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.220
It's too late for that!

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.990
Time to put you in your place!

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.370
Right back at you.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.030
Seems our only choice is to fight.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.380
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:34.880
Three minutes remain.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.250
It's finally over...

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.970
Yeah, that took forever.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.870
Made it in time...

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:00.910
He's dead.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.860
The fool.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.690
Better to live and try again,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.190
than to pass and die.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.290
One minute remains.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:14.220
Looks like it'll just be
the nineteen here.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.650
Kurapika, applicant #404,
is the twentieth to pass.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.410
Killua, applicant #99,
is the twenty-first to pass.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.360
Gon, applicant #405,
is the twenty-second to pass.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.170
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.650
My butt hurts...

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.830
I didn't expect a slide

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.590
for the short and easy path.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.940
Three of them...

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.350
Thirty seconds remain.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.220
That was really close.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.320
My hands are covered with blisters.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.730
Same here.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.700
Leorio, applicant #403,
is the twenty-third to pass.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.490
Tonpa, applicant #16,
is the twenty-fourth to pass.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.240
Total time, seventy-one hours
and fifty-nine minutes.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.350
My hands are blistered,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:28.120
but all five of us cleared
the tower together.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.310
All thanks to Gon!

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.290
We entered the long and difficult path.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.210
Then cut a hole in the wall,

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.030
to sneak into the short and easy path.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.600
Man, I can't believe

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.830
you actually came up with
that idea on the spot.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.160
I realized that we could break
the walls, using the weapons.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.160
But it took over fifty minutes.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.840
<i>In an extreme situation,</i>

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.670
<i>you were able to calmly evaluate</i>

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:14.920
<i>our two options and circumvent them.</i>

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.420
<i>That's what makes you special.</i>

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.450
The Third Phase of the exam is over.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.140
Twenty-five applicants have passed.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.390
One has died.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.580
Though the team members
had their differences,

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.940
Gon was able to bring them together,
to overcome the trial.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.450
However, a friend today may
become a foe tomorrow.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.900
Gon doesn't know that before long,

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.990
they'll be pitted

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.370
against each other,
in brutal, individual battles.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.460
Next time: Letter x From x Gon!

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.850
Now I'm worried.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:29.890
Because of me?
