WEBVTT

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.310
Facing the palace, each of the three exits

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.990
is progressively closer to the throne room.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.740
Okay, we're all agreed.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.020
We'll all use the closest exit,
and bust in from beside the central stairway.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Confusion x And x Expectation

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.920
This seemed like a good idea
since Leol-sama praised me so much,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.670
but dispelling <i>Nen</i> is hard.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.420
And the stronger the <i>Nen</i>,
the bigger my stomach gets.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.490
This was a bad idea.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.620
To a girl, there's nothing
worse than losing your figure.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.060
I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.120
Right, Shidore?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.250
Having a peon that understands
speech is useful, but...

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.510
You really need to talk more.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.360
You have permission to shoot her on sight!

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.020
As a foreigner, she can't blend
in with the other citizens!

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810
Damn! Damn that woman!

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.170
What does she want?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.150
Hey!

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.370
How many times have I told you
not to use your cell phone here?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.660
The radio waves irritate my ears,
and it gives me a headache!

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.920
Plus, I can hear what you're saying.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.930
Next time I catch you, I'll snap your
phone and your arm in half.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.150
W-Well... There are urgent matters
that must be dealt with.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.300
I need to use my phone.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.310
It's so urgent that you find
the woman who ran away?

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.640
I can find her for you.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.310
R-Really?

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.620
My nose happens to be very sharp...

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.460
If you have something she wore, I can track her.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.070
The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.740
and I respect you, as well!

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.330
So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.080
O-Okay!

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.770
Hold on, and I'll bring you something.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.540
I will become the King behind the scenes.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.270
To accomplish that, I must be friendly
with Bizeff, not with the King.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.640
Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.220
Bah.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.250
When peons send transmissions,
it gives me a headache.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.090
This smells like...

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.800
Taragette's blood.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.360
There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.680
An intruder!

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.360
If he took his shoes off here
to avoid leaving footprints,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.610
he must be somewhere deeper within.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.870
He didn't hide his shoes because

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.120
he had a pressing mission and
couldn't afford to lose time...

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.100
That day last week, when it rained?

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.560
That was the day Taragette went missing.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.980
I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.740
But that means he disposed of Taragette's body

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.600
while leaving his shoes behind.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.000
There's no blood trail nearby.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.890
If he wrapped the body in something to move it,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.650
he must have come prepared.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.650
Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.180
Why would they do that?!

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.900
Damn, I don't get this!

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.570
Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.410
No, I'll catch the intruder,
and get the answers from him.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.680
He did head inside the palace!

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.640
This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.890
Follow me!

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.300
What is your name?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.440
It's K-K-Komugi.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.380
Can you please tell me what your name is?

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.950
I didn't get to learn his name...

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.340
I can't wait to play him again!

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.600
Who am I?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.300
A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.110
My subjects are mindless puppets.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.610
If this is the fate that the
heavens have granted me...

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.940
I have no doubt that I shall
be slowly bored to death!

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.630
Don't follow me.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.090
Yes, but—

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.390
Do not make me repeat myself.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.830
Now we've all been beaten by the King.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.150
The King says your <i>En</i> is irritating him.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.770
I figured he would be saying that soon.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.660
But I can't remove our security...

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.380
Then you go and tell him that!

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.590
I don't want another beating.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.700
How does this sound?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.040
We can block all aura in a radius
surrounding Your Majesty.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.050
This way, my presence will not bother you.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.680
Are you telling me to stay in one place?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.680
Given that keeping

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.650
the aura-free zone around me
while I move wouldn't be possible.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.340
I refuse to have my movement
constantly monitored.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.700
No, that would not be our proposal.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.700
So if I do not wish to deal with your presence,
I will only be able to move

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.190
within that confined area.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.960
I must order you to move that zone
should I wish to go elsewhere?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.910
There is nothing more I can say.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.940
Keep your <i>En</i> focused outside the palace.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.930
I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.180
Are you dissatisfied?

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.440
Should that not suffice to guard
against outside attacks?

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.110
Or are you saying that there
are already enemies inside?

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:30.940
That would be admitting that your <i>En</i>
is completely worthless, would it not?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.620
You're absolutely correct.

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.490
If my <i>En</i> is focused only outside, it cannot detect

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.020
any attack from underground.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.800
In addition,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.080
my <i>En</i> is not capable of recognizing
an enemy that is already inside.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.010
Do you mean Komugi?

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.690
No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:03.150
and they are free to enter and leave at will.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.340
A check is performed each time someone enters,

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.160
but if the soldier were being
controlled by the enemy,

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.640
it would be difficult to know for sure.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.790
That means—

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.690
Enough.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.530
You may use <i>En</i> on the first floor of the palace!

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.290
That will permit you to guard
against any underground attack!

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.030
Tell everyone that no one is allowed
on the second floor or above.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.800
Should an intruder come, I shall
deal with them personally.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.980
Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.540
If you disturb me, it will
have violent consequences!

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.730
The other Ants

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.810
were never allowed on or above the second floor...

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.470
But where do I go now?

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.440
The central stairway connecting the
first and second floors, I suppose...

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.800
If an intruder comes from underground,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.200
you will be in position to deal with them.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.740
Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.490
Is he upset about losing
all those Gungi matches?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.270
I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:16.470
My ability, Spiritual Message, would be
able to confirm my suspicions.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.710
However, that would be an insult to the King!

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.750
No, I'm just making excuses...

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.000
The truth is that I'm afraid.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.470
So afraid of what it is

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.500
that grows inside the King even as we speak,

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.090
I cannot bear it...

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.130
Tsk, the rain washed away the scent.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.640
But now I have the answer.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.010
The intruder hid here to
check the second floor,

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.280
but instead of going upstairs, he exited.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.330
Something made him give up his mission?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.770
Or did he accomplish his objective?

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.390
No, he may have used his power!

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.130
I should probably warn you...

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.030
If any of you go to the second
floor, the King will kill you.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.280
Tell everyone else in the palace.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.780
Yes, sir.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.590
Wings!

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.560
What if the intruder has the power to fly?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.090
The shoes and scent could have
been there to mislead us.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.050
He could have flown up to the second floor!

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.380
Youpi-dono...

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.300
Huh?

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.200
Uh, er...

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.860
<i>Pitou is monitoring the palace with </i>En.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:44.350
If they'd gone to the second floor,
they would have been caught...

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.210
Ah, sorry... It's not important.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:48.400
Huh?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.650
That doesn't make sense!

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:52.960
Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.860
Youpi-dono...

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.820
Huh? What is it?

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.370
Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use <i>En</i>?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.200
For example, that day last week when it rained?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.290
What? You didn't hear what happened?

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.970
There was a huge uproar...

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.710
The King tore off his own arm!

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.980
Pitou had to heal the King,
so Pouf was using his <i>En</i> instead.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.970
How wide is his <i>En</i>?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.420
I wouldn't know about that...

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.100
Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.550
No, I'd guess that Pouf's </i>En<i> only
reached as far as the stairway.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.900
The intruder saw that aura,

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.810
and gave up on ascending!

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:34.730
That all makes sense.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.230
The question is what the
intruder's objective was,

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.610
and whether he's still hiding around here.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.740
Do I tell Youpi?

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.620
No, I can't do that...

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.230
I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.770
Pouf would be the best choice.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.380
And if possible, I need to determine

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.250
what the intruder's objective was.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.880
Otherwise, my report would be

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.210
that the intruder somehow
made it inside the palace,

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.640
but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's</i> En<i>.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.440
I won't get any credit.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.760
I can make up an objective,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.430
but if the intruder is captured,
they'll find out I lied.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.470
But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions
and the intruder is never found,

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:25.100
it would only waste their time
and damage my own standing.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.160
Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.310
I have a great idea...

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.910
So the intruder captured one of my men.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.300
According to Leol, that intruder
has the ability to teleport.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.250
I believe that he and the
woman are working together.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.690
They probably teleported out together.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.870
Damn, but why would they do that?

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:51.810
Yes, that's the question.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.900
However, I've discerned their objective.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.440
What is it?

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.940
To blow up the palace.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.370
That's a lie.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.220
What?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.850
We must tell the Royal Guard!

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:04.810
Wait.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.010
Don't be in such a rush.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.450
We can tell them after we've found the bomb.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.290
There's no time!

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.790
Calm down, and consider this
from their perspective...

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.940
Eh?

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.470
If they want to blow up the palace,
they'll wait until they're sure the King is here.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:20.800
When would that be?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.460
When all the citizens have assembled...

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.350
Right before the ceremony begins!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.260
There will be five million humans!

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.580
What a sight that will be to see...

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.690
Just imagine looking down on them!

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.200
The King would not allow a double
to steal that gratification from him!

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.450
So he will be there in person!

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.090
It's only logical to assume the enemy
reached the same conclusion.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.080
True...

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.540
I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's
side for many of these celebrations...

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.960
The experience brings indescribable
pleasure beyond even sexual gratification.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.720
We still have over half a day
before the ceremony.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.670
If I use my nose to track the intruder,

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.740
we can find the bomb with time to spare.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.970
If we have proof when we report to the
Royal Guard, we'll look much better.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.510
If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.860
Right?

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.530
Yes... That's true.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.800
As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.430
Okay, that sounds good.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.870
The coward finally calmed down?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.620
I'm getting closer to becoming
the King behind the scenes!

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.380
Seven minutes to go.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.350
I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.920
Assemble near the exit then.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.010
Until then, stand by.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.620
Meleoron, about your power...

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.970
I know.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.400
I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds
before I need to breathe...

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.150
And then, I'll tap you again when
I start to hold my breath again!

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.620
You don't need to push your limits.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.840
You should catch your breath
whenever you need to.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.530
When God's Accomplice isn't active,
you can trust me to handle things.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.260
Why don't you have a smoke?

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.290
If you underestimate their sense
of smell, you'll die quickly...

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.120
Tracking someone by the smell of
cigarette smoke is simple for them.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.220
We could be knocked out the
second I take my first breath...

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.730
The boss will be putting up a smokescreen
when we go in. It'll be fine.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:51.320
I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.580
I don't want to regret my decision.

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.590
The Royal Guard is on the move.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.640
The three of them gathered above the
front gate to discuss something.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.710
Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.050
Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.720
so I don't think anything has changed.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.970
I'll let you know if anything else happens.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.600
Yeah, until we leave, feed us as
much information as you can.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.630
Essentially, that eliminates the
possibility of the Royal Guard

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:28.610
being out of the palace.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.580
Essentially, but not completely...

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:36.670
Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.870
You can't guarantee anything.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.070
We have to be prepared for any possibility,

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.010
or we'll be slow to react when
something goes wrong!

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.890
You only say that because you don't
understand how loyal they are.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.320
It's impossible that they'd leave the King!

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.620
The Royal Guard is always with the King!

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.430
And it's fine to believe that!

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.590
But we should prepare for any exceptions!

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.390
Give me an example of one
of these exceptions!

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.430 line:20%
There are all kinds of exceptions!

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.650
Honestly, how can they be having
a dispute at the last second?

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.650 line:20%
You're being too unrealistic!

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.650
One exception could be a woman...

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.890
Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.810
I wasn't sure what the King was doing in
the palace, but he was reproducing.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.030
That must be it.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.800
I see...

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:26.080
That would give the King a reason to keep
the Royal Guard from his bedroom...

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.550
Perhaps Bizeff was bringing
women in for the King.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.260
Palm and the King?!

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.960
We're sticking to the plan...

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.180
No matter what's happening to Palm!

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.690
Gon has no idea what they're talking about.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.440
I'm glad we realized this before we set out.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.950
If we'd seen something like
that without warning,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.950
we'd have frozen in our tracks.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.680
Get it now?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.530
You can never overthink something.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.830
There are probably other unexpected
situations that we haven't considered yet.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.560
Yes, something is still bothering me.

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:09.980
Gon...

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.210
Do you understand?

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.220
Let Palm take care of herself!

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.790
No matter what you see,
you must stay focused on Pitou.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.970
Yeah!

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.440
It bothers me, but whether
a woman's involved or not,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.060
I believe we should be prepared
for a third party in the palace.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.980
I have a feeling that the third party

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.160
is causing my anxiety.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.990
Why did the King injure himself?

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.110
Hold on...

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.990
That was just a theory of yours.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:44.000
Yeah, but you agreed that there
was no other logical explanation.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.480
You're contradicting yourself...

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.130
Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.550
Following that logic,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:59.040
Pitou could have stopped using <i>En</i>
for other, unexpected reasons.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.880
I understand that...

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.140
But something doesn't feel right.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.960
With three minutes left to go, is this
something worth thinking about?

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:10.150
Yeah.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.780
Yeah, think about it...

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.730
When would you try to hurt yourself?

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.040
When I couldn't forgive myself...

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.680
When you couldn't forgive yourself?

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.050
That's the logical conclusion...

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:40.820
But that would mean the King
is a ruler with personal pride,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.400
and not just a cold tyrant.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.300
True.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.160
For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.520
Speaking from experience,

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.180
people like him will never
be willing to compromise.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.320
If the leader refuses to compromise,
neither will the Royal Guard.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.010
You should assume that combat
will be our only option!

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.050
Morel was able to sum everything up...

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.660
But he's wrong.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.120
The King's self-injury...

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.050
The third party...

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.210
We still haven't correctly
deduced what happened.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.720
I have a feeling...

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:26.130
that the truth has the potential
to completely ruin our plans!

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.660
It's time!

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.260
One minute to go.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:31.730
Gather around.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.480
Damn! We're out of time...

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.250
At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.870
Let's do this, boys.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.270
Get ready to rumble!

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.350
Next time: Charge x And x Invade.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.900
Yeah, hot pots are great in winter...

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.700
Which reminds me of mystery pots.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.800
Charge into the pot!

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.020
I think you mean toss into the pot...
