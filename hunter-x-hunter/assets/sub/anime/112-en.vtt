WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.020
Midnight

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.980
Monster x And x Monster

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.820
The moment Killua entered the palace...

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.020
I knew it!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.490
...was his reaction.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.700
He couldn't sense Pitou's <i>En</i> at all,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.010
and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had
expected to encounter on the first floor.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.070
Despite the fact that they were now

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.390
in a situation that was utterly
unforeseen in their planning,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.020
Killua's experience helped him stay calm.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.860
Who are these guys?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.530
Where did they come from?

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.530
From Youpi's perspective, too,
his current situation was an impossibility.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.720
Youpi immediately ceased all thought.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.680
I am a shield.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.200
I protect the King with my body.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.140
Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was
created from Magical Beasts, not humans.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.450
Perhaps that was why

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.010
he lacked the self-preservative
nature of the other two Royal Guard.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.710
However, that lack also gave him strength.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.160
The moment Youpi changed
forms with a belligerent smile,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.180
Shoot froze at once.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.980
However, it wasn't because
Shoot was slow to react.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.990
If I move any closer, he will attack.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.740
And if his attack happens to connect with
the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.500
In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.270
he began to move his cage and floating arms...

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.620
And then it happened.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.870
This is Dragon Dive!

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.320
Then the old man's friend is...

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.680
Only Killua understood what was happening,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.590
and it momentarily froze him.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.390
The shock was even greater to those
who didn't know what was going on.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.660
There were only two present,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.840
Gon and Youpi, who remained focused
on the enemy that faced them.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.340
No way!

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.100
Has he lost it?

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.120
You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.120
No, wait.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.810
Realization came a moment later to Killua,

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.900
and still a few moments later to the others.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.820
Seriously, even in this situation,

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.380
how did he realize that, and so quickly?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.910
If Meleoron and Knuckle were to
be pierced by a Dragon Lance

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.470
while God's Accomplice was
active, and die instantly,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.390
would their invisibility cease?

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.350
Or would the <i>Nen</i> remain, leaving them to
decompose without anyone ever knowing?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.650
No one knew the answer.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.620
Assuming the latter, confirming whether they
were still alive would be impossible.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.420
Meaning that, in the worst-case
scenario, someone else would

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.660
have to deal with Youpi.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.920
That should have been my job...

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.670
Gon!

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.170
Shoot did nothing wrong.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.350
Even I was later than Killua
in noticing and reacting.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.430
Shoot, don't blame yourself...

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.790
Pull yourself together!

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.190
If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.380
you're left with Pitou!

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.340
However,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.400
Shoot was feeling a completely
different emotion at that moment.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.660
Gon!

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.340
I want to tell the entire world...

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.820
"This is Gon!

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.290
A boy less than half my age,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.060
to whom I owe my life."

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.580
I've always gone to any lengths
to avoid facing danger and risk,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:40.320
hiding myself within a safe cage,
where no one could hurt me.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.980
I hated myself for it...

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.870
But I couldn't change myself.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.080
Friends and teachers encouraged me,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.730
but I never truly listened,
considering it the logic of the strong.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.500
Yet somehow...

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.840
A boy with less than half my strength

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.470
managed to break my cage!

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:18.640
Shoot did indeed tend to shrink
back weakly from opportunity.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.650
I will survive...

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.400
So that I can thank you!

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.320
However, even he didn't realize that

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.460
such unique turns in his train of thought
made him shine in the face of adversity.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.140
Good!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.540
Knuckle and Meleoron...

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.940
...are alive!

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.700
What?

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.550
Who was it that just attacked me?

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.440
I couldn't see a thing...

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.580
Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.300
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.930
Naturally, they had already tested
to confirm that God's Accomplice

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.770
would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:18.310
As long as God's Accomplice stayed active,
Youpi would be unable to see APR.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.870
Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.880
what had just happened, rather than
concentrate on the enemies before him.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.730
I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.990
Which means my focus right now should be...

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.140
So far, everything had proceeded
according to the Hunters' plan.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:56.130
However, after a successful first strike,
Knuckle could only shudder.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:59.640
Seriously?

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.600
It's like his aura is unlimited!

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.510
After surviving over five thousand battles,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.980
Knuckle had the experience and intuition
to quantify his opponent's strength.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.620
It was not uncommon for him to
face enemies who were stronger

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.550
than previous opponents he had encountered.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.270
However, there was no comparing
the power he now faced

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:38.570
to that of the opponents who had come before.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.930
A monster with an immense amount of aura.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.110
Five times what the boss has?

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.570
Ten times?

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.520
More?

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.550
I can't tell!

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.750
He had never experienced anything like this.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.940
Assuming he's ten times stronger,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.620
with 700,000 aura,

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.740
how long will it take before he goes bust?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.270
The King!

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.140
That was when

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.740
the Hunters felt

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.490
the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.540
Youpi immediately noticed
that momentary hesitation.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.030
Your Majesty!

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.680
Your Majesty!

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.340
Since Pitou lacked wings,

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.010
the only option was to continue free falling.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.570
This was actually a stroke of luck.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.720
Had there been unlimited courses of action,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.710
Pitou would have joined Pouf and
rushed straight toward the King,

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.430
a Royal Guard's natural reaction.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.220
In that scenario, it's unlikely
that Pitou would have had

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.040
the presence of mind to use <i>En</i>.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:53.870
As a result...

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.080
The guest room on the second
floor of the west tower...

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.460
The King is with the woman with closed eyes.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.950
<i>They're also using</i> En <i>to locate the King!</i>

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:38.660
This was when Pitou realized the
seriousness of the situation.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.300
In that instant, Pitou crouched like the
four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.950
with upper legs tensing like steel

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.470
until they were twice as large as they'd
been before the attack on Kite.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.320
In order to reach the King

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.190
before the enemy could.

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:19.900
But a second later...

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.430
A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.960
was strong enough to make
Pitou regret the decision.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.540
This is...

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:43.950
the King's...

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.450
The aura coming from the King

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.930
was so unmasked, his current state
of mind was plain to read.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.620
As a result, Pitou could only conclude

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:02.590
that the situation had grown
even worse than previously thought.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.500
The main stairway had collapsed!

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:01.180
When the King looked down,
time began to move again.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.820
However, time remained frozen for everyone else.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.630
The intruders, who had come for the King's life,

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200
were holding their breath and standing still

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.210
because of the girl covered in blood.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.960
And because the grotesque
creature holding her body

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:34.440
was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.490
Pitou.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.490
Y-Yes, sir.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.030
The expression on the King's face
had returned to normal.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.850
This only increased Pitou's concern.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.500
Heal Komugi.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.700
I'm counting on you.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.760
The two veterans continued to stand by,

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.720
silently watching their enemies,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.480
out of respect.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.120
This was an act of love for a life.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.580
Should they infringe upon that act,
their cause was lost.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.670
It would have been inhumane.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.580
This isn't what I was given to expect.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.110
For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.960
Netero felt the same way.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.590
Not here.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.260
Let us go elsewhere.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.510
I believe that a different location

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.440
would be to your benefit, as well.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.360
Netero had spent a great deal of money
to enlist Zeno to help separate

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.880
the King from the Royal Guard.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.250
He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.110
However...

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.040
Well, I suppose.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.890
He could not help but feel
he had lost the initiative...

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.540
Doctor Blythe.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.890
The moment Pitou's ability was activated,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.680
the two men thought that their decision

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.550
to lower their guard would prove fatal.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.360
Because the King was able to walk
between them with ease.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.910
Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.920
Next time: An x Indebted x Insect.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.070
Gon, what are you eating?

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.530
Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.850
I-Insects that are candy?
