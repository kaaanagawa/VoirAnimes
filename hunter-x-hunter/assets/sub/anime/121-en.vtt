WEBVTT

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.730
Don't come any closer...

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.990
Pouf!

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.990
Defeat x And x Dignity

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.250
Why?

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.730
Had you remained silent,
I could have killed him.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.810
Why are you so needlessly frightened?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.060
He noticed you.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.800
If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.380
he would have immediately attacked Komugi.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.900
That was a risk I didn't want to take.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.340
Your words baffle me.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.900
Isn't he sitting there because
he wants to help that girl?

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.490
You almost make it sound like
he means to harm her.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.530
Why?

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.020
It's none of your business.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.420
Shut up.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.430
Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.430
You go find Knuckle.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.990
Pouf is outside the barrier,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.470
so it's very likely the big guy was taken out.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.180
Review the situation,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.450
then you and Knuckle decide what
to do, and whether to retreat.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.470
Wh-What about you guys?

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.850
Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.200
At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.700
I'm kidding!

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.770
It'll be fine.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.830
I've always got the magic word, "Kite"!

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.630
I have it under control.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.460
Really?

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.620
Then why did you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.660
look so sad back there?

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.910
You're sure, then?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.320
You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.400
Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.400
It's none of your business.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.350
Shut up.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.160
Shut up?

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.930
Downwind, huh?

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.360
Am I interrupting something?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.730
Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.400
Don't move.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.620
Stay right there.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.160
You can use your wing scales to control others, right?

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.700
Don't take a single step.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.430
Pouf, please!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.590
Are you insane?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.280
You want me to stand here and do nothing?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.000
For that woman's sake?

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.280
For the King's sake!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.220
Do as he says...

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.100
What happened?

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.750
Your expression has changed...

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.180
What happened while I was trapped?

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.260
I promise that I shall not move from this spot.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.630
In return, I want you to tell me

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.630
everything that has happened thus far.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.640
If I ask where the King is, he'll
get suspicious and silence us.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.240
Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.330
Be careful to make it sound quite natural.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.400
If you fail, we will see bloodshed.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.090
That's all there is to it.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.780
It's time.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.120
Adding interest.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.580
I've got it...

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.820
I could feel myself controlling the explosion.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.810
If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.000
I need rage...

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.070
I must build up my rage before
I forget how it felt!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.710
That's the second time you've
made a fool out of me!

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.330
Scum! Trash!

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.720
Piece of crap!

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.010
Stay calm, and let rage consume me...

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.340
Create and destroy at the same time.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.350
Manifested through this body!

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.680
Youpi had yet to notice

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.850
why two conflicting emotions
could exist simultaneously...

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.530
Or what his current predicament was.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.930
Rage...

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.120
Rage is not intended to be scattered.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.370
It's meant to be focused on a target!

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.250
I Will Destroy You!!!

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.610
I will destroy you!

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.270
Okay! Okay!

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.310
It's a fake, okay!

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.380
Keep it up...

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.680
Make me madder!

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.310
Come on!

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.030
It's time.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.360
Adding interest.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.080
APR's interest is calculated

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.710
assuming that aura consumption will
continue to rise at the current rate.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.560
Even if Youpi were to reduce his
aura usage to a bare minimum,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.140
in another three minutes and fifty seconds,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.180
he would reach the point at which
he would be unable to use <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.190
Ten left.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.360
My back's against the wall...

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.050
Looks like he's saving me for last.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.580
In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.130
Morel had deployed all of his puppets
close enough for Youpi to see

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.710
so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,

00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:00.770
but also because he no longer had the
strength to move his puppets around.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.270
If he lost his focus, the puppets would
return to smoke and dissipate.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.070
It shouldn't be much longer...

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.660
<i>He has to run out of</i> Nen <i>at some point.</i>

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:14.310
But...

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.830
But damn...

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.940
My body and soul...

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.250
refuse to move.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.690
At this point, Morel could not
even will himself to stand.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.250
He had literally reached his limit
even before Youpi went bankrupt.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.060
Zero left...

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.450
I have something to say to you.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.370
Now that Youpi had learned

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.290
how to store his rage elsewhere,
his head was much clearer.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.830
You look like a little fly that's about to die.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.800
And yet...

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.050
That's what makes you guys amazing.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.400
During the battle, Youpi had
evolved at an alarming rate,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.300
increasing the gap between
the Hunters and himself.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.530
Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.580
Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.500
this must have been the last thing he
expected Youpi to say in this situation.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:45.140
But Morel could honestly accept
that this was Youpi's true nature.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.500
I'm not sure how to say this...

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.580
But because you've impressed me,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.030
I have to be sure to kill you.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.220
It's only proper, I guess?

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.570
This is game over.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.660
Well, I'll end this with one blow.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.730
Don't move.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.230
I don't think I even mind letting him

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.990
kill me now.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.990
Bye.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.870
He disappeared?

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.260
There's blood...

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.270
What's going on?

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.020
It wasn't teleportation?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.150
The moment I was about to cut through him,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.650
he disappeared.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.760
I thought that one of them had the
ability to use teleportation...

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.890
But when he disappeared,
I didn't see anyone else.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.920
And I struck before he disappeared, so if
he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.550
But I was able to cut him.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.220
Yet I can no longer see him.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.550
Does that mean he only turned invisible?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:18.420
An ability to become transparent?

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.680
If he had that ability,
he would have used it sooner.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.920
Which means one of the others

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.940
must be able to make himself
and the rest invisible.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.400
And right before I connected, he tried
to save the guy with the sunglasses.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.450
But I left a deep wound.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.650
Here he comes!

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.760
The blood...

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.350
Youpi can follow the blood!

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.220
We may be invisible, but the
blood is leaving a trail.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:09.690
If he swings that blade again,
I'll have to get away by myself.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.140
I'm running out of breath...

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.480
Damn it!

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.270
Knuckle?!

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.120
Why did you reveal yourself?

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:38.290
Right now, your job is to stay
hidden as long as possible!

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.340
I'm done running and hiding.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.640
I'll face you.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.640
So...

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.150
Let them escape.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.650
Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.290
because Youpi's words had
struck a chord with him.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.160
You're crazy.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.140
You can't even call that a trade-off.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:18.980
My answer

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.420
is no.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.180
However...

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.680
If you get rid of this thing,
my answer might change.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.440
I'm sure this has to do with why you've
been constantly on the run.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.440
Removing it will make the
exchange more even.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.450
No... Don't do it!

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.450
Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.460
Morel's desperate cry did not reach
Knuckle due to God's Accomplice.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.970
However, it did return Meleoron to his senses.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.100
Leave me here...

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.110
You can't!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.860
You can't do that, Knuckle!

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.110
Don't worry about me...

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.370
Will you waste everything we've done?

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.450
Everything that Morel, and Shoot...

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.870
and you...

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.120
have done by risking your lives!

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.780
If Knuckle didn't act, the two of
them could still fight together.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.010
To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.460
With that in mind, the decision that
Meleoron made after leaving Morel...

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.270
Knuckle!

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.020
Knuckle!

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.030
...ended up backfiring.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:09.660
Impossible...

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.190
We no longer have a way...

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.290
to defeat Youpi...

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.290
Why...

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:28.330
The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded
Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.870
Okay... I took away APR!

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.760
Now the terms are even.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.060
Leave the boss alone!

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.090
Fight me!

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.320
Kill me!

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.700
No way.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.510
Hold on!

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.710
Where are you going?!

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.750
To the King, obviously.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.000
Do you want to come with me?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.460
I doubt you could handle it.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.470
His ability isn't teleportation, is it?

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.120
Then you'll have to carry the
guy in sunglasses to a doctor,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.730
or you struck this deal for nothing.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.520
If protecting the King was his first priority,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.200
he should have killed all three on the spot.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.280
It's no big deal...

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:41.250
You weaklings can attack me all you
want, but I'll still shake you off.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.170
The fact that he was aware of this,
but didn't carry it out,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.330
irritated Youpi on a level that didn't
compare to his previous rage.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.810
Come for me whenever you want.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.260
I'll fight you as equals.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.560
I don't need to kill you right now...

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.210
And that's all there is to it!

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.150
Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.820
During this battle, Youpi had learned
how profound <i>Nen</i> really was.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.190
That also altered what little
sense of self he'd had before.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:22.990
Having learned to quarantine
his rage and stay calm,

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.670
Youpi had lost his ability to
see things in simple terms.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.380
They're responsible for the rage I've built up,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.380
so why don't I feel like using it on them?

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.510
What, or who, am I supposed
to unleash this rage upon?

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:51.420
Was this a sign of maturation?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.290
Youpi wasn't sure.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.450
However, as for Knuckle...

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.150
I completely lost...

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.590
Knuckle!

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.340
We gotta help the big guy!

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.910
Come on, boss.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.600
I told you to leave me here...

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.860
Go!

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.680
The two of you...

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.450
can still fight.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.360
Do what you can.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.730
He said to go whenever you want.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.630
So go now!

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.150
I can't.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.960
I can no longer think of him...

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.390
as a target to destroy.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.390
Wait...

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.420
He acknowledged our efforts.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.360
He wasn't a bad guy.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.900
In that case, I no longer have...

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.430
any reason to defeat him.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.410
The King...

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.660
Knov-san!

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.410
The soldiers are not important.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.210
If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
will become demons if necessary.

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.740
I'll take care of Morel...

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.430
Shoot is also okay.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.530
Are you guys also coming?

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.900
Wait, let me sock this baby hard.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.690
I received a message from
the chairman's messenger.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.940
As planned, he was able to take the
King to the appointed location.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.690
If they leave now, the Royal
Guard won't make it in time.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.130
Their job is done, and so is ours.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.720
Where's Palm?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.080
We don't know yet.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.260
Okay...

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.460
What will you do?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.930
I don't know if I'll be back again.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.840
You can see how bad I look...

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.340
Are you going or staying?

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.220
We're staying.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.180
We still have a job to do.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.850
I see.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.020
You're strong...

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.120
Let's go.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.340
To look for Palm?

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.710
No, we can do that later.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.240
There's something else we have to do.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.310
Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.630
Next time: Pose x And x Name.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.730
Hey, Killua... Say my name.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.350
Huh? Why now?

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.770
Just do it!

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.140
Gon.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.140
Killua.
