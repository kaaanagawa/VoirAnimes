00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
I have a bad feeling.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.480
I feel like I'm missing something.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.510
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.990
A x Fated x Awakening

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.580
Kite, Gon, and Killua have
taken care of Hagya's soldiers.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.010
As they head deeper into NGL in
search of the Chimera Ants' nest,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.530
within the Queen's castle,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.140
one of the soon-to-be-born
King's three Royal Guards

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.080
is about to awaken.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.640
What kind of magic did they use?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080
Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.580
Impressive.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.090
This one almost looks like he was smashed
by a rock, or some other hard object.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.370
And Baro's the one with an iron shell.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.310
So this is the rare humans' power.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.100
Are you worried now?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.280
The king of the jungle's blood
runs through my veins.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.190
A few humans can't scare me.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.730
Of course...

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.900
Whew, that's a relief.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.360
I thought I was gonna miss out on tonight's feast.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.170
These must be extremely rare humans.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.620
We'll tear them to shreds and gobble them down!

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.990
We're being followed.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.390
Not from there.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.700
There's quite a number of them.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.050
Listen up...

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.730
Your job is to distract the enemy,
while attacking from a distance.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.400
Do not get too close.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.200
The 2nd Platoon will take the right,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160
as the 3rd Platoon pincers
them from the left.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.120
My 1st Platoon will trap them,
preventing a rear retreat.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.670
Go!

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.840
Gon and I didn't notice them.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.990
They're coming from the left and the right.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.190
Keep up your guard.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.080
Damn...

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.580
The trees are getting in the way.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.960
Yeah.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.340
Shouldn't we get out of the forest?

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.680
This is a trap.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.610
Okay, keep up the chase.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.040
Hagya-sama, all goes according to plan.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.760
Good work, Flutter.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.530
Once we drive our prey into range,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.180
one strike with my fangs will finish them.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.630
This doesn't feel right...

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.290
Eh?

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.460
You ordered Flutter to chase the prey,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.240
while you hid in the grass to ambush them.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.870
That's pretty lame.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.630
Huh?

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.780
Aren't you the king of the jungle?

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.340
A king should face his prey, rather than hiding.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.730
Just jump out and go,
"Roar! Chomp! Ga ha ha ha!"

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.750
That's so much cooler.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.140
But you know...

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.680
This is how the king of the jungle hunts.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.450
Shut up and watch!

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.020
Well, I don't care, so long as I
get to eat the rare humans.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.380
Rare human?

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.590
What's that?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.460
I'll explain the details later.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.470
Its number is 4-933.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.990
It was captured and brought
in by Zazan's squadron.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.370
Number 4-933...

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.560
Doesn't mean a thing to me.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.850
It was probably given to the Queen.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.860
Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.530
She'll give birth to an incredible king.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.730
Don't see 'em.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.390
It must already be inside the Queen's belly.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.490
Are you certain?

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.830
It isn't here...

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.560
Where else would it be?

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.500
Could it have escaped?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.060
Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.180
will be paralyzed for at least a month.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.380
After a mere three days, it couldn't move around.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.730
You can't be sure when it
concerns the rare ones.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.190
They aren't like normal humans.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.390
You should know that very well.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.320
I'm not the same creature I was before.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.490
The next time I see them,

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.850
I'll crush them, rip them apart, and eat them.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.880
The antidote I hid in my
back tooth came in handy.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.920
But I could barely drag myself across the ground.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.810
For the time being, I'll have to hide here...

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.400
But what's going on?

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.300
<i>How can a Chimera Ant use</i> Nen?

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.040
Could you check once more?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.180
Come on, give me a break...

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.430
I'm busy enough as it is.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.310
Didn't you hear me say the Queen
has a huge appetite now?

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.620
I am well aware of that.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.290
I don't know anything about this "rare" stuff,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.900
but why are you so obsessed with this human?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.740
I'd like to ask it a few questions.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.340
Can't you see the light surrounding his body?

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.510
Light?

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.460
No, I don't see a thing.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.840
I see.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.880
Then it's true that only some
can identify this power.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.720
Meaning it's a talent.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.030
Exactly.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.780
This talent is my destiny, bestowed
upon me by the heavens.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.230
The power of a chosen few...

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.480
If I master this power, I can become the king!

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.610
I will be king!

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.980
Retreat! Retreat!

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.190
Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.210
Wh-What's that?

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.340
He's gorgeous!

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.990
We're leaving.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.090
Huh?

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.330
What about the feast?

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.960
He was able to understand
that he was outclassed,

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.180
and he calmly backed down at once.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.140
Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.290
I always believed that the world

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.100
revolved around my claws and fangs.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.390
That if I brandished them,

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.850
I could take the life of any other creature,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.620
could always satisfy my own hunger...

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.940
And that I was truly blessed.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.520
However, that wasn't the case.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.650
Others were stronger,
so I never could have ruled.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.210
Death taught me that lesson.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.490
But I am stronger now.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.320
At the moment, we may not be
strong enough to defeat them.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.350
But now we are armed with the ability to learn.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.920
We're following them.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.940
Their nest must be nearby.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.780
If we follow them,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.670
we will find the Queen.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.880
What is that?

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.670
Something is coming!

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.530
That was a fascinating conversation...

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.560
You mentioned something about talent.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.460
Allow me to take part.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.010
O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:05.470
If I master this power, I can become the king!

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.140
I will be the king!

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.150
A short and foolish dream...

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.760
I am totally outclassed.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.660
I can never escape the position
I've been born into...

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.530
You can relax.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.530
Let's talk over there.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.920
Y-Yes!

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.780
This power is not for me...

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.390
But for this Royal Guard...

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.950
And for the King it serves!

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.550
This power is for serving them!

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.580
Impossible...

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.830
What is that

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.290
evil aura?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.680
By the way...

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.340
Yes?

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.890
Why is a live human underneath those bones?

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.590
Hmm... <i>Nyow</i> I understand.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.360
What are you researching?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.870
I'm learning about those rare
humans you mentioned.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.430
I've attempted to study them many times,

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.500
but it wasn't written in any books.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.500
Asking one of them is faster
than flipping through books.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.240
Wasn't that why you were looking for him?

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.020
Th-That's exactly right.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.070
There we go.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.910
Ah!

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:13.060
"New memories are stored
in the hippocampus,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.590
while old memories are kept
in the cerebral cortex.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.160
To invoke those memories..."

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.620
<i>Nyow</i> I understand.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.200
Ah, you... Come over here.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.310
<i>Hatsu</i> is a technique for
manipulating aura at will.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:49.640
To summarize the categories of <i>Nen</i> users...

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.240
They are:

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.170
Enhancers,

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.670
Transmuters,

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.310
Conjurers,

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.780
Emitters,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.980
Manipulators,

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.170
and Specialists,

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:11.040
for a total of six categories.

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:15.250
C-Categories...

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.910
Every <i>Nen</i> user belongs to one of these.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.990
You want to increase the amount of your aura,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.230
as well as the speed of its flow.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:41.570
Most of your basic training will
be spent on these two tasks.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:47.160
In a battle between <i>Nen</i> users,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.490
those are the factors that...

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.960
That...

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.000
Th-that are pivotal

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.490
in determining the victor.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.930
<i>Nyow</i> I understand...

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:16.810
In addition to the basic <i>Nen</i>
abilities <i>Zetsu</i> and <i>Ren</i>,

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.110
there are also unique techniques that reflect

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.010
the <i>Nen</i> user's individuality.

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.860
If you develop a technique that synchronizes
with your style and <i>Nen</i> category,

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.740
the manifestation of your ability has
a better chance of being stronger.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.120
And how do you identify which
<i>Nen</i> category you belong to?

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.740
Water divination

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.480
is the simplest

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.260
and most commonly used method.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:06.990
Water divination?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.380
Give it a try, Rammot.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:19.760
Right.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.590
Since the water's overflowing,

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.000
that makes you an Enhancer.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.480
An Enhancer?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.620
Which confirms that Rammot is a <i>Nen</i> user?

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.940
Seems so.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.000
Oh, yeah...

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.400
Didn't you say you fought a rare human?

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.500
Y-Yes.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.630
The impact from its attack opened your pores...

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.390
And released your aura.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:02.260
Pores?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.270
Apparently, they're small holes all over your body.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.130
If they're sealed, aura can't be released.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.270
I see...

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.700
Colt also thought that Rammot's change

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.170
was triggered by his fight
with the rare humans.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.320
It seems he was correct.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.640
So if Rammot is a <i>Nen</i> user now,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.900
can we use him to open everyone's pores?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.190
Sure, sounds good.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:37.730
I think I'll give this a try.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.310
The leaf wilted...

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.700
Unbelievable.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.290
<i>One of us was born possessing </i>Nen <i>ability</i>,

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.820
without having to fight a rare human!

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:05.100
Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.200
not belonging to another category?

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.830
Neferpitou.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.380
Huh?

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.340
That is the name the Queen gave me.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:19.590
From now on, call me Neferpitou.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:20.900
Right!

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.770
I don't need him anymore.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.010
Feed him to the Queen now.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.940
Right!

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.120
From birth, Neferpitou already
possessed incredible power.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.020
This presence casts a dark shadow over the fates

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.440
of Gon and his friends.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.090
Next time: Light x And x Darkness.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.760
Wake up!

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.590
C'mon, it's morning.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.130
It's 10:50.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.610
I'll kill-you-a!
