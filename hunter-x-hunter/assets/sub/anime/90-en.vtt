WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
He's so...

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.690
He's so gentle!

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.820
He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.880
And providing guidance.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.450
He's telling me how to become stronger.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.500
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.130
you fight on the premise of escaping.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.590
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.020
you must leave Gon's side.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.980
Interest x And x Curse

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.280
As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.550
Gon and Killua are deep in thought.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.050
The loser...

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.060
Hands his token to the winner.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.770
Gon...

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.830
As promised,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.830
I'm coming at you

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.330
at full power!

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.450
If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.520
I have to be ready to take the hit...

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.340
And counterattack!

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.770
Don't follow him by sight.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.250
Sense his motions...

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.640
Through my aura!

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.330
A little late, but I sensed his approach!

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.430
But what's going on?

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.620
I feel power rushing through my body...

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.820
It's time.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.790
Adding interest.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.830
Wh-What is this thing?

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.000
I let you borrow

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.570
some of my aura.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.630
You let me borrow your aura?

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.410
By the way, I charge ten percent interest.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.560
Ten percent

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.640
every ten seconds!

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.050
If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.900
It's time.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.780
Adding interest.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.910
I call this ability "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.030
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.660
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.490
That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.020
Attacking APR is a waste of time...

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.850
It'll just hang around you,
telling you when your interest goes up.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.880
It's both harmless and invincible.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.680
Though it can be an eyesore...

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.400
It's time.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.950
Adding interest.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.510
Again.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.130
It doesn't hurt at all...

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.270
Instead, I feel another power rush.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.190
It's time.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.700
Adding interest.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.150
It suddenly almost doubled?!

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.240
That's because I just lent you

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.360
another 180 aura.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.420
180 aura?

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.860
What do these numbers mean?

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.930
It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.440
"180 aura" is a numeric measure
of your spiritual power.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.620
Aura accumulates in the body,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.530
and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP)

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.890
varies according to your training.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.680
Also, there is a limit on how much
aura you're able to release at once,

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.450
which can be raised through training.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:33.830
In other words,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.230
Present aura Output Potential [POP]

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.600
your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.150
If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.450
Present aura Output Potential [POP]
Actualized aura Output Potential [AOP]

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.880
the amount of aura you can actually release,

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.740 line:20%
1000 aura                                      200 aura

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.300
you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.130
When you use <i>Ken</i>, you can sustain

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.680
a maximum 1,800 aura around your body.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.140
When preparing for battle,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.740
you usually expend 1 aura per second.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.860
However, once the fight begins,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.020
you begin to use advanced techniques such as <i>Gyo, Ryu</i>, and <i>Ken</i>,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.790
which require considerable <i>Nen</i>.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.800
This increases the rate you expend
aura by six to ten times.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.650
The stronger your techniques,
the more aura you use up.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.970
Got that, fool?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.140
Your control is still weak,

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.920
so you're burning 10 aura every second.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.280
That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.530
In yesterday's fight, you ran
out after twenty minutes...

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:40.020
So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.530
Then add your four Jajankens!

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.600
Your AOP is around 1,800 aura.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.820
But at the moment you called out "<i>Jan</i>"
to activate Jajanken, the aura focused

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.610
in your fist was over 2,000.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.990
That's due to its long charge and your defensive
sacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.800
A special provision covers such risks
attributed to special attacks.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.700
You expended around 5,500 aura
with the first three Jajanken shots!

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.950
That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.500
As for the fourth shot...

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.190
Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.550
Assuming that you needed twice the
usual aura amount to complete the attack,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:37.980
the fourth shot required 4,000 aura.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.690
The amount of aura used up is
the same for Rock and Paper.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.410
However, Paper falls within a different category,

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.160
and you haven't practiced much,

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.140
so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.120
That probably only had the strength
of about a 500-aura attack.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.890
Thus, your maximum POP

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.130
is around 21,500 aura!

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.740
I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.360
Looks like you're not good at math.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.320
But I'm just getting started!

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.280
Listen up, fool!

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.250
When your borrowed aura, including interest,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.210
surpasses your current remaining POP,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.200
you'll bust.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.610
Aura works like a bank account balance.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.600
If you keep spending, your balance decreases...

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.150
But the interest keeps skyrocketing!

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.980
It's been a few minutes since we started.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.570
You've used up at least 2,000.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.320
Take a look.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.920
It's huge!

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.740
That's not all...

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.490
It's three times what it was before?

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.410
That can't be right!

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.110
It's only been two or three minutes!

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.150
To be precise, it's been 120 seconds.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.260
This exemplifies how interest
can snowball on you.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.150
It's time.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.520
Adding interest.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.240
Even after adding in the

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.320
390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.740
Your debt will continue to grow.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.310
Even if you stand perfectly still,

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:43.580
in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.820
you'll bust.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.670
Bankrupt

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.210
What happens if I bust?

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.550
APR will become the
Individual <i>Ren</i> Suppressor,

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.840
and spend thirty days tracking the target.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.060
During that time, the target will
remain in a state of <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.060
Basically, unable to use any <i>Nen</i>.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.300
It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.950
That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.320
He held back for my sake...

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.000
Knuckle!

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.810
Thank you.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:36.970
Here I come!

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.000
That punch just now was around 150...

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.090
You returned 150 to me,
but I lent you another 180.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.370
The net impact is that your
loan increases by 30...

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.910
What will you do now?

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.030
Until your debt is repaid,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.860
I won't take damage from your attacks.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.250
It's time.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.080
Adding interest.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.710
Yeah, come at me, fool!

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.550
If you just stand around, you'll bust
after the four minutes expire!

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.070
You managed to land more hits.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.820
But ultimately, you only returned about 100.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.850
It's time.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.290
Adding interest.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.710
That's just a drop in the bucket.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.320
You repaid less than half your
last interest payment...

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.400
I won't let you launch Jajanken again.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.970
Once your debt passes 10,000,
my victory is assured.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.990
It's time.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.980
Adding interest.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.650
Wh-What is that?

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.190
Can't let him intimidate me.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.400
Neither of us knows anything
about the other's abilities!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.540
I don't like hurting other people.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.000
That's why I chose a power that only activates

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.050
when I must hurt someone.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.060
To give myself a weapon that only works

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.960
against those I have no qualms about hurting.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.760
However...

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.520
You boys have taught me

00:14:54.940 --> 00:15:00.090
that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.090
Three hands?

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.510
How?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:06.550
They're floating?!

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.420
What kind of power is this?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.580
Should I attack first?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.890
Stay calm...

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.220
<i>Observe the situation with</i> Gyo!

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.360
<i>He's not using </i>In.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.360
There are three floating hands.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:27.860
That means,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.410
most likely, he's a Manipulator.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.620
That cage is also a mystery.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.050
He doesn't need it if he plans to use

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.600
those flying hands to attack.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.880
In other words...

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.640
Touching those hands is dangerous!

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.140
Yo-yos, huh?

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.430
Let's see what you can do.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.580
He's amazingly adept...

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.190
He's fast!

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:32.100
Those hands were just a distraction?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.100
Jump back.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.980
When facing an enemy you
believe to be stronger,

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.610
you fight on the premise of escaping.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:50.110
No way...

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.890
That's no different from what I've always done.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.000
Use electricity!

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.500
Couldn't get the attack off!

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.670
My body won't listen to me...

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.510
This...

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.560
is my curse.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.580
His reaction was slow.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.930
Is something wrong?

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.300
Stop... Don't think about it.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.500
It's my bad habit.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.900
His circumstances don't matter.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.900
Do my best to defeat him.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.780
Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.410
He's strong and fast.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.420
He probably has me beat in every area...

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.510
That's right, Killua...

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:50.670
That's the way.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.840
Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.430
I have to stop thinking that way!

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.440
Your weakness is that you're
too quick to give up.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.290
Even when facing enemies with equal strength,

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.200
you worry about how strong they are,
or what they might do to you.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.710
If we're talking about a stronger
enemy, there's no question...

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.910
You don't bother to think of how you could win.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.950
Running is your only option.
That's how losers think.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.240
I realize that this isn't your fault.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.190
It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.220
Habits that are burned into your
body and soul aren't easy to break.

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.570
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.230
Forget it.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.730
You can't win.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.380
My left eye?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.270
The left side of my face

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.880
is gone...

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.150
That was a much better reaction.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.560
Was what happened earlier a fluke?

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.170
If you take damage without knowing why,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.240
get as far from the enemy as you can.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.890
My curse saved me.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:27.850
But that isn't good enough!

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.140
Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:37.910
to face enemies stronger than
you will take determination.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.410
I must fight to win!

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.050
I'm blind on the left side...

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.810
There it was again.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.500
You reacted quickly.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.290
No! I'm just running away!

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.320
I haven't been fighting at all...

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.320
If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.280
you must leave Gon's side!

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.970
I'm done running away.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:46.980
Take this...

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.480
Electricity?

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.490
Scary.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.740
Doesn't matter... Follow him.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.370
Never overpursue.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.020
Go after him!

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:22.390
How—

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.300
Stop.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.640
...did you know?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.150
What am I asking that for?

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.200
While Gon and Killua

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:41.570
were fighting for the tokens...

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.590
Next time: The Strong x And x The Weak.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.720
Here I come, Killua...

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.860
Time to eat!

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.590
Bring it!

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.250
My yakiniku meal.
