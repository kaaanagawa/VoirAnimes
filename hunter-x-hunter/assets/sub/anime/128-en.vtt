WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.570
With the detonation of Miniature Rose,
the bomb activated by the stopping of his heart,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.780
Netero perished with the King.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.010
Your Majesty!

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.520
He's breathing!

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.770
But damn it...

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.650
We must hurry... Or it'll
be too late for the King!

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.760
And there isn't time to take him to Pitou!

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.980
It will be fine...

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.620
I will save the King.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.290
How?

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.580
I will feed myself to him...

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.210
That's all there is to it.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.980
Come, my cells!

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.620
Diffuse throughout the King and heal him!

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.480
Your Majesty!

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.650
Your Majesty...

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.360
Are you all right?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.190
How do you feel?

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.350
This exquisite taste...

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.950
I feel as though I am breathing the air of paradise.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.260
My strength is returning...

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.090
This is a fairy mist.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.300
I am...

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.520
I am not worthy of such praise!

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.140
I am happy to hear that.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.200
Please feast to your heart's content.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.230
There is plenty here.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.590
I crave it...

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.690
Now that I have experienced this taste,

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.480
I cannot eat anything else...

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.610
Your Majesty...

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.490
Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.760
Please stop taking me to the heights
of heaven's bliss with your praise!

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.640
No more!

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.910
Your Majesty!

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.320
Your Majesty!

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.980
You may also feed on this.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.260
He's liquefying his cells.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.760
You thought this through, Youpi.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.220
It's so powerful and rich...

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.540
Surely, this comes from the heavens.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.300
Drops of angels themselves...

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.390
Your Majesty!

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.100
There is no way to compare the two.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.830
All I can say is that I have never

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.090
tasted better...

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.890
Not enough...

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.270
I need more.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:19.700
Bring me as much as you can of both...

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.370
Yes!

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.870
My King!

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.240
With pleasure!

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.220
Supreme bliss...

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.540
Unparalleled joy.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.280
What is this?

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.910
What is this feeling?

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:29.920
From now on, call me Meruem...

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.190
That is the name my mother gave me.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.330
I see...

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.990
So this is...

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.640
...unconditional love!

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.160
Having witnessed an absolute
being's death and rebirth,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.460
and having shared their own beings with the King,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.500
Pouf and Youpi had at last reached

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.510
the pinnacle of their species...
The level of Queen.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.200
It's clear that his strength has increased.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.460
He's even stronger now!

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.720
Our bodies have helped the King...

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.030
And become part of him.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.220
What an honor... What bliss!

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.470
The King's heartbeat! The King's warmth!

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.240
We even share the King's thoughts!

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.440
However...

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.990
That is why we know...

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.780
The King is currently...

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.870
...confused.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.600
Your Majesty!

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.580
M-Meruem-sama...

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.640
How do you feel?

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.290
Should we return to the palace first?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.280
If you wish for more of that food,
we can provide it.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.150
In a few minutes, my clones will arrive.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.790
Food...

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.230
Ah...

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.920
Then that taste was real.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:02.320
As I wandered through the light,
I heard someone call my name.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.730
Calling, "Meruem."

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.800
I do not know if that was a dream or reality.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.560
I cannot remember why

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.090
I am here.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.720
Meruem-sama...

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.050
You've lost your memory?

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.660
I feel fine.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.570
In fact, I am brimming with energy.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.320
But my mind is hazy...

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.110
Why have your appearances changed?

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.470
We sent our clones to scout the area.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.250
They are searching for remaining
enemies to dispose of—

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.240
You may have my best interests in mind.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.510
But when you lie to me, you betray me.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.020
You will not get a second chance.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.870
So, I was eating you.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.410
We offered ourselves to you!

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:48.680
We know we acted beyond our places!

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.660
But we made the decision!

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.040
What happened? Give me an explanation.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:03.300
Before we can do that,
I must ask you one question.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.870
It appears that you recall
our former appearances.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:13.060
Do you remember the day
we first began serving you?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.510
I do not.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.740
I recognized that you were my
Royal Guards Pouf and Youpi

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.250
the moment I saw you.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.580
No, I should say I remembered that you were.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.330
However, I cannot recall anything
about how that came to be.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.960
Meruem-sama...

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.090
I believe you are suffering from temporary
memory loss due to the explosion.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.370
Explosion?

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.220
Yes.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.980
You came here to engage
in a duel with the enemy.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.150
However, the cowardly human

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.610
resorted to the underhanded
trick of using a powerful bomb,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.580
betraying your honorable intentions!

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.450
A duel...

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:15.540
Yes...

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.910
I was

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.230
fighting a duel.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.770
We knew that, given your power and fortune,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.390
a mere human weapon could
never deal a lethal blow.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.140
However, we could not bear
to see you in that state.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.330
So we did what we could to speed your recovery,

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.650
knowing full well that we might be punished.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.440
Our bodies have always been yours.

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.660
We were simply returning them to you.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.670
Let's return to the palace!

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.570
That will be the fastest way
for you to regain your memory!

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.350
This is

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.990
my perfect

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.180
chance!

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:22.090
If I return to the palace first,

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:25.690
I can dispose of her!

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.890
At the moment, the King does not remember her.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.590
If I eliminate her now,

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:38.080
he will never have the chance to remember her!

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.580
This will require...

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.920
Convincing Pitou?

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.380
Getting rid of that meddling human?

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.090
No...

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.840
The first thing to do

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.630
is to end her life.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.420
If I kill her, everything else will fall into place.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.490
The King will need twenty
minutes to reach the palace,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.940
and that is if he runs at full speed.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.560
I have enough time to kill her.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.240
This feels as natural as though
I was born with these.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.550
I will learn to fly in no time.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.940
Which way to the palace?

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:50.600
North.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.200
You should be able to make
it in fifteen minutes!

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.460
It's there.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.960
The answer I seek is in the palace.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.140
He is fast!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.000
If I waste too much time, he'll catch up!

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.480
Fifteen minutes?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.990
No, at this speed, he'll arrive in five minutes...

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.830
I have but two to three minutes.

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.520
Quickly, my clones!

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.830
This is a gamble.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:55.500
Once the King sees the millions
of humans outside the palace,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.590
he will remember everything!

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.330
Remember that his objective
is to rule all living creatures!

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:10.640
So long as he doesn't see that woman!

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.660
As a Royal Guard...

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.740
As one who has inherited the Queen's will...

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.740
I must eliminate that lowly human girl!

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.100
She's gone!

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.420
Where is she?

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.340
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.350
I've seen you once before.

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:56.860
Before I was placed in the cocoon.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:04.990
So I can see you, no matter where you are.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.120
Wink Blue: Lonesome Deep Sea Fish

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:10.240
What?

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.880
What just attacked my clone?

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.020
It came from nowhere.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.380
Pouf, what is that?

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.940
I don't know.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.890
It seems to have resulted from the
remaining enemies attacking my clone.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:32.650
We must hurry.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.320
The King!

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.700
The King is alive.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.260
Next time:

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.850
Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.170
You know how people say "like" all the time?

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.800
Sure.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.100
So wouldn't it be a, like, "Formidable-like
Enemy x And x Clear-like Objective"-like thing?

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.390
Uh...
