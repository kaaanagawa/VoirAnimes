00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.860
Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.110
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.330
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150
The word "unknown" holds magic.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.290
They are known...

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.010
...as Hunters!

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.890
Baffling x Turn Of x Events

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.990
You're awake?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.380
Where am I?

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.030
A waiting room, next to the
arena for the Final Phase.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.470
Upsie-daisy...

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.270
Right. I was in the middle
of the Hunter Exam.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.880
Your arm will heal quickly.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.730
The break was very clean.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.240
In fact, once it heals, the bone
will be stronger than before.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.050
In any case,

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.590
congratulations on passing the exam.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.610
Satotz-san, I...

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.430
You can't.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.650
Just as someone who has failed
the exam can no longer pass,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.550
someone who has passed
the exam can no longer fail.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.990
The rest is up to you.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280
If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.650
you are free to destroy or
put away your license.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.960
You can even sell it,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.600
since no one else will be able to use it.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.130
However,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.140
a person who has passed the exam will
not be allowed to take it again.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.840
Professional Hunters are treated well,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.020
largely due to our predecessors' efforts.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.150
Hence, there are many applicants
who harbor ill intentions.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.650
If it weren't for them,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.290
we would accept every person who applied.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.740
Most professional Hunters consider

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.850
this card more valuable than their own lives,

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.490
yet no more than a worthless scrap
of paper at the same time.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.300
The important thing

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.930
is what you accomplish once
you become a Hunter.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.180
What I accomplish...

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.940
Gon-kun,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.590
you can decide for yourself when
you're ready to use this card.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.430
I have faith in your judgment.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.830
A lot of people helped me reach this point.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.340
I'll use this once I've returned the favor.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.320
Then allow me to congratulate you.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.720
Thank you, Satotz-san.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.760
What about the other applicants?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.720
The exam is still going on, right?

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.230
No, the exam is over.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.530
Really?

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.410
Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.300
Really?

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.050
The others who passed are currently
completing a brief orientation.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.770
You will undergo the orientation later.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.620
Who failed?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.870
It was

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.220
Killua.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.130
Why did Killua fail?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.470
First, let me fill you in on what transpired

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.420
after you were knocked out.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.020
That will help you understand
what occurred.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.350
After you fell unconscious...

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.410
When he wakes up, he'll probably
refuse his license.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.540
That sounds like something Gon would do.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.970
Only one person will fail this round, right?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.420
If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the
rest of our fights meaningless?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.680
Don't worry. Gon has passed.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.410
Nothing he says can change that.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.750
If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.420
we still wouldn't be able
to revoke his license.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.800
Very well.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.950
Why did you let him win?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.080
Let him win?

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.710
I'm sure you knew how to make Gon
surrender without killing him.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.330
Given your skills.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.690
When I torture someone,

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.470
I expect that person to hate me
for the rest of their life.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.850
It's more effective and less stressful.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.890
When someone is in pain,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.600
their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward
the one responsible for that pain.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.370
Even with extensive training,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.980
it is difficult to suppress
that gleam of hate and rage.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.240
But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.060
Can you believe it?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.480
I had just broken his arm.

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.210
But his eyes had already
forgotten about that.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.880
I guess you could say that he won me over.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.630
If you need a reason, there you go.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.140
Gon-kun, you were able to
win over your opponent.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.240
Hanzo said so himself.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.520
After that, the second match began.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.280
The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.030
Begin!

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.160
After the two of them fought for a while...

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.310
Wha—

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.580
I lose.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.300
Huh?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.650
And Kurapika won.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.310
What did Hisoka say?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.890
I don't know,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.060
but Hisoka voluntarily conceded.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.570
The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.280
Pokkle found himself in much
the same position as you,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.570
but he admitted defeat immediately.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.560
Sorry, but I won't go easy on you.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.210
That sealed the deal.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.960
The fourth match was between
Hisoka and Bodoro.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.640
The match was extremely one-sided,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.150
but Bodoro refused to give up.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.580
However, while Bodoro
was lying on the floor,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.010
Hisoka whispered something in his ear.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.760
And Bodoro surrendered.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.540
The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.420
but as soon as the fight began,
Killua walked away.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.660
Confidently, he declared...

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.050
Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.300
He must have felt that he
could win his next match.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.180
However,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.150
Leorio requested that the sixth match

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.270
be postponed while Bodoro
recovered from his injuries.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.530
So Killua and Gittarackur fought first.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.530
Begin!

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.260
That was when Killua made a fatal mistake.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.300
It's been too long, Kil.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.640
Brother...

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:44.140
Hunter Vocabulary

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.140
Illumi

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.340
Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.480
Yes, his name is Illumi.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.830
Hey.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.930
Killua's brother?

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.660
He used those needles to change
the shape of his face?!

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.670
I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.050
I guess.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.800
Mom was crying.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.180
Anyone would cry if their
son did that to them.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.830
Tears of joy.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.940
She was so happy to see that you'd grown up.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.690
But she was worried about you leaving home,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:36.270
so she asked me to check up on you.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.440
What a coincidence.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.470
I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.810
I'm trying to get a license for my next job.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.590
I don't really want to be a Hunter.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.710
I just felt like taking the exam.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.530
I see...

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.700
That's a relief.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.500
Then I have some advice for you.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.440
You're not cut out to be a Hunter.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.790
You were born to be...

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.650
a killer.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.580
Is that really what he said?

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.640
Killua mentioned his family before,

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.270
but they sound crazy...

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.120
He wasn't finished yet.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.880
You're a puppet of darkness, without passion.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.120
You don't want anything or wish for anything.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.260
As one who lives in the shadows,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.660
you can only feel pleasure

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.140
when people die.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.080
That's how Dad and I raised you.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.270
What would you accomplish
by becoming a Hunter?

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.200
True,

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.150
I don't desire to become a Hunter.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.290
But...

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.660
I do have something I want...

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.700
You don't.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:09.660
I do!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.720
There's something I really want!

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.540
Tell me what it is that you want.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.180
What's wrong?

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.300
There's nothing you really want, is there?

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.420
That's not it!

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:39.200
I want to become friends with Gon...

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.880
I'm sick of killing people...

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.440
I want to become friends with Gon,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.340
and to live a normal life...

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.330
That's impossible.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.820
You'll never be able to make friends.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.910
Your only concern when you meet someone
is whether you should kill them.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.220
That's how you were trained.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.130
You just don't know how to classify Gon

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.360
because he's too dazzling for your eyes.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.660
You don't actually want to
become friends with him.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.230
You're wrong...

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.600
If you stay with him,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.360
you'll end up wanting to kill him one day.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.870
You'll get the urge to see if
you can kill him or not.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.290
Because you have the soul of a killer.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.650
As we mentioned before...

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.250
Yeah, I know!

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.130
Killua!

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.800
I don't give a damn if he's your brother.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.910
He's a worthless piece of crap!

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.300
Don't listen to him!

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.220
Just beat the crap out of
him like usual and win!

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.020
You want to become friends with Gon?

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.190
Are you daft?

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.810
You already are friends!

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.120
I'm sure that's how Gon feels!

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:07.700
Really?

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.200
Hell, yeah, idiot!

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.360
Really... That's no good.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.270
He considers Kil a friend.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.250
Okay, I'll kill Gon.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.460
A killer doesn't need any friends.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.570
They'll only slow you down.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.840
Where is he?

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.960
P-Please wait!

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.410
The match is still...

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.650
Where is he?

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.740
The waiting room over there...

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.650
Thank you.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.200
This won't do.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.420
I need a Hunter license to do my job...

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.190
But if I kill them, I'll fail,

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.840
and Kil will pass automatically.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.190
Oh, darn. The same thing
will happen if I kill Gon.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.060
I know!

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.190
I'll pass the exam before killing Gon.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.480
Bastard...

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.710
If I wait until after passing the exam,

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.990
I can kill everyone here and
still keep my license, right?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:36.620
Yes, according to the rules.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.490
Did you hear that, Kil?

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:44.250
You have to beat me if
you want to save Gon.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.290
Will you fight me for your friend's sake?

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.280
You can't do it.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.190
Because you're more worried

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:02.140
about whether or not you can defeat me.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.900
And you already have your answer:

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.460
"I'm not strong enough to beat my brother."

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.080
"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.790
I drilled that into you...

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.410
Don't move!

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.010
If you move an inch, I'll assume
that the fight has begun.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.740
And if our bodies make contact,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.570
that will also mean the fight has begun.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.450
There's only one way to stop me.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:37.550
You know what that is.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.060
But don't forget...

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.310
If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.970
Take him out, Killua!

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.570
We won't let him kill you or Gon!

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.450
We'll stop him, whatever it takes!

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.930
Let him have it!

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.840
I surrender.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.590
I lose...

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.330
Oh, that's good!

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.230
Then the battle's over.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.520
I lied, Kil.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.410
I was lying about killing Gon.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.870
That was just a little test.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.990
But now I have my answer.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.980
You don't have the right to make friends.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:41.990
Nor do you need friends.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.260
You should just listen to Dad and me,
and do your job as you always have.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.710
When the time comes,

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.010
I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.230
You don't need a license yet.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.560
After that, he was reduced
to a shell of himself.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.930
Leorio and Kurapika tried to help,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.020
but he wouldn't respond.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.020
The sixth match was between
Leorio and Bodoro.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.320
Bodoro had recovered,
but when the match began...

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.650
Begin!

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.140
It was over in a second.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.770
Killua had killed Bodoro.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.150
The committee disqualified him.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.230
Gon-kun!

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.050
Where is everyone?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.240
You need more rest, Gon-kun...

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.510
Gon.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.150
Apologize to Killua!

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
Gon was angry.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.160
Illumi had trampled on

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.660
his brother's desire to become
friends with Gon,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.170
abandoning Killua to despair.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.260
And Gon was angry.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.590
Next time: Some x Brother x Trouble!

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.640
Do Leorio and I look alike?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.990
Get out of here...
