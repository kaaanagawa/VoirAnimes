00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Staff of Judgment
If player names a target,
while raising staff toward the sky,
disaster will befall either player or target,
depending on which has done more evil.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.430
Elder's Growth Pills
Each pill taken helps player grow 1 centimeter.
Each bottle contains 100 pills.
Not recommended for those under 20.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.180
Fledgling CEO
If you warm this fledgling egg
in your hands 3 hours a day,
it will hatch in 1 to 10 years.
The feelings you put into warming
it will speed the process.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.250
Yes! Halfway there!

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.570
That makes fifty types!

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.040
15 x 15

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.590
Genthru and his men have a plan in mind,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.620
as they prepare to trade
with Team Tsezgerra.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.080
Let's get this over with, then.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.990
Okay, trade complete.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.070
No, hold on.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.820
I cannot accept this.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.610
This is an unfair trade.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.620
What? Don't complain once it's done!

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.310
We gave you three cards!

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.720
What more do you want?

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.790
Wait a second...
That isn't what I meant.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.870
I'm saying that it's unfair to you.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.480
It's too skewed in our favor.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.030
I dislike the idea of
benefiting from charity.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.800
And it will continue to bother me,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.120
even if we clear the game first.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.710
So I have a proposition.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.320
Right or left.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.560
I'll give you one of these cards.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.170
One is worthless,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.070
but the other is Breath of Archangel.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.190
Good Luck

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.450
Okay!

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.310
Levy on!

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.170
Crap!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.960
Return on.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.030
To Masadora!

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.750
Let's go after them!

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.700
Wait!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.260
First, check your cards!

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.880
I lost one of the #80 cards
we were monopolizing.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.140
As well as a #65.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.230
Hey, what did you lose?

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.940
I lost #42 and #53.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.500
I lost #29 and #24.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500
They got me good!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.660
I lost two of the #85
cards we were hoarding.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.900
All the ones they took were
restricted slot cards...

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.770
And they took both card types
that we were monopolizing.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.490
Damn!

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.540
They must have used Risky Dice.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.750
We're not with them!

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.970
They used items to change our faces!

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.650
Anyway, we have to pursue them!

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.730
No!

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.140
Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.550
U-Uh, we don't know.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.900
But he went like this with his hand and
blew the head off the guy I was with.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.700
A power clearly meant for murder.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.070
So he's a fighter.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.480
It would be unwise to
fight them head-on.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.330
But they took at least five
different card types from us!

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.890
They could have completed
their collection!

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.620
List on!

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.590
#2!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.340
Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore.
Currently, 0 cards in play.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.560
We're still okay.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.300
They haven't found #2,
Patch of Shore, yet.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.470
Our immediate priority

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.850
is to find #2 before they do!

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.110
We still have our voucher
for Breath of Archangel,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.380
so we can still beat them.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.730
Right, let's find it first, then.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.650
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.670
Accompany on!

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.320
To Soufrabi!

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.260
We did it... A big success.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.820
The Risky Dice and Levy
combination paid off.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.560
That puts us at ninety-three types.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.010
No, we used one up to
change those faces,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.170
so it's ninety-two.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.310
The important thing is that we took
the cards they were monopolizing.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.300
And for two of the others, we're just
waiting for someone to use Gain on them.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.680
The biggest obstacle is #2.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.310
But we know that it's in Soufrabi.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.150
All right, we'll go after #72,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.870
#21, and #9 in that order.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.320
Then we'll make for
Soufrabi, to find #2.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.020
For #75, we simply need to find
someone with it, then take it.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.500
I think it's time we began thinking...

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.280
About the three restricted
slot cards we want to keep,

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.350
and how we want to spend the 50 billion.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.390
Hey, Killua...

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.440
Something's been bugging me.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.340
Huh?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.350
Aren't there hundreds of players?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.060
Isn't it weird that we've been able

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.470
to turn all our items into cards?

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.470
What do you mean?

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.480
Even B-rank restricted slot types
have a thirty-card limit.

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.310
The players here before us should
have already collected them.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.660
That's true.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.610
But you can also see it this way.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.120
Fewer than thirty teams in this game
are capable of making real progress.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.870
Oh, I see.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.980
Most players aren't worried
about getting restricted slot cards.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.510
They're just struggling to find
a way out of the game.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.260
It would suck if you got to Masadora,
and there weren't any Leave cards.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.140
Yeah, that's why...

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.640
I get it...

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.750
Huh?

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.600
If you guys got to Masadora,
but there weren't any Leave cards,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.650
what would you do?

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.380
Well...

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.150
I'd save money until a Leave showed up.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.340
Yeah.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.010
Okay, then what if

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.880
you acquired a super rare
spell card while waiting?

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.530
Sell it and buy more spell
cards until a Leave came in.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.470
Really?!

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.210
I would save it...

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.450
Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you
bought ended up being worthless?

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.040
If you saved it, you might be
able to trade for a Leave—

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.330
See?

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.810
Need a Leave?

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.270
Want to go back to the real world?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.330
We've gotten four restricted
slot cards for three Leaves.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.710
Okay, that makes a total
of fifty-four types.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.720
Score!

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.900
So the cards that wouldn't fit in
our binders reverted to items.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.070
We're running out of free pockets.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.100
Then we should organize them now.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.020
We three have a total
of 135 free pockets.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.840
We should each leave
around 5 pockets free.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.480
You keep the spell cards, Killua.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.610
Bisky should also have
a few defensive ones.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.860
Wait! I have to use spell cards?

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.570
No way! I don't know how they work.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.490
The hell? Then learn how they work!

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.160
Okay...

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.010
Book.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.680
We've been deliberately
avoiding other players,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.660
but we'll have to take risks
to obtain the rarer cards.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.630
Yeah.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.140
Well, let's get what we can ourselves,

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.390
then negotiate aggressively
with any players we come across.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.040
Sound good?

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.190
Yeah.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.020
Yep!

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.000
See ya.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.400
Hold on.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.610
This is worthless.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.280
It's a transformed Fake.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.460
Sorry about that.
I gave you the wrong one.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.750
Here's the real one.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.290
Man, you can't lower your guard
around any of these guys.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.610
No kidding...

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.410
Still, that necklace is quite useful.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:33.180
Hey, this necklace can
remove curses, right?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.390
Only from spell cards.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.670
Oh, so it won't work.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.180
Did you have an idea?

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.710
I was wondering if a curse
was behind the disease

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.110
that all those villagers
were suffering from.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.800
Villagers?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.320
Oh, those people...

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.240
The ones who took all your money.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.560
But it won't work since
they aren't cards.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.240
No.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.110
It's worth a shot.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.250
Will you trust us with your lives?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.930
You freely gave us everything you had.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.760
We will trust you!

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.860
Sick Villagers
Villagers struck by a
contagion passing
around the island.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.940
Healthy Villagers
Healthy villagers who
recovered from the contagion
going around the island.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.560
It worked!

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.870
Thank you very much!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.950
This treasure has been
passed down for generations.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.050
Please accept this
token of our gratitude.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.710
Awesome!

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.710 position:80% line:20%
Lucky Alexandrite
Owner will enjoy
once-in-a-lifetime experiences,
for better or for worse.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.330
Lucky Alexandrite! Score!

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.600
Another player has used
Contact to reach you.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.220
Yo, this is Kazsule.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.670
I'd like to talk to you.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.100
Could we meet in person?

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.230
About what?

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.980
Some people are close
to clearing the game.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.200
Huh?

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.350
It's a team of three,
led by someone named Genthru.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.320
Genthru!

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.900
Thanks for coming, everyone.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.160
Much appreciated.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.910
Team Kazsule

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.910
As I mentioned via Contact,

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.910
Team Asta

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.760
Team Genthru is close
to completing the game.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.170
Team Hanse

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.130
I just checked the ranking,

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.590
Goreinu

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.980
and they're currently
at ninety-six types.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.670
Team Yabibi

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.250
We must figure out a way to stop them.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.210
Can I ask something?

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.930
What is it?

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.440
How do you check the ranking?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.100
Well...

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.680
You don't know how to do that?

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.920
If we answer all their questions,
we'll be here till dawn!

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.310
Just cut to the chase.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.250
Now, don't be so mean...

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.570
We're all here to exchange information.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.800
They could have information
you don't, Asta.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.320
That's impossible.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:03.700
Those kids are amateurs who don't even
know how to use the Trade Shop.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.910
In the Trade Shop,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.830
there's a ranking that lists
players and their total

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.330
restricted slot cards.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.840
If you pay a fee, you can even learn
the numbers of their cards.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.940
But getting a player's name from
the ranking still won't let you

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.750
use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.240
Not until you actually meet them.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.740
Don't you feel smarter now, boys?

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.690
In other words, if we know
the members of a team,

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.900
we can determine how
many cards they have.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.680
And Team Genthru is only missing #0,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.370
#2, #9, and #75.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.030
#75...

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.800
There's a solid theory that #0 appears

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.910
in an event after the other
ninety-nine are collected,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.250
so they only need three.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.830
We propose to find one of those
three types before they do

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.760
and monopolize it, to prevent
them from clearing the game.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.490
There's gotta be something else.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.890
We could deluge them with spell cards.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.150
They already have a Paladin's Necklace.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.650
So Levy is the only
spell that will work.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.650
Levy
Take 1 card at random from every
player within 20 meters of caster.
[SR][SP]

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.650
And they can block Levy if
certain conditions are met.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.150
It's safe to assume

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.410
that Genthru is willing to reveal
that they have ninety-six types

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.910
Prison
All slotted cards on target page are
immune to theft or destruction via spell card
until removed.
(Only targets
pages 1 - 11.
Free slot pages
cannot be targeted.)
[DEF][CONT]

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.910
because their pages are
protected by Prison.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.310
That's possible...

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.280
Genthru was collecting
a bunch of spell cards

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.550
with the others who tried to recruit us.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.240
It's a reasonable assumption.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.520
We could always take
their cards by force.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.140
Would you be willing to lead the attack?

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.730
We don't know what kind
of abilities they have.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.960
Finding a card type to monopolize
is the most practical option.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.430
I assume no one has objections.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.290
Then let's get to business.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.150
We'll need everyone here to cooperate.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.230
I'm fine with the proposed plan.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:01.320
But I have a problem with these members.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.750
Hold on, Asta.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.510
I followed your condition...

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.890
Have over fifty types of cards.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.950
These six teams met that condition.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.990
I also said that they had to be
people who could contribute.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:21.220
I don't see how these kids
can contribute anything.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.470
You're the one being uncooperative.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.710
You've got a smart mouth.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.520
Then show me some proof
that you can be useful.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.620
We know Team Genthru's abilities.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.480
We have one of the three
cards they're missing.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.180
Still dissatisfied?

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.810
No, that's good enough.

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.030
So tell us what their abilities are.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.000
What about you?

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.620
Show us some proof you
can be useful to us.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.610
We have seventy-one types
of restricted slot cards...

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.100
Significantly more than you.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.130
I'll give you an A-rank card in
return for the information.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.380
You shouldn't have a problem with that.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.870
I have a problem.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.390
We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.880
So give us two S-rank cards or
equally valuable information.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.450
Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.640
Don't get too cocky, brat!

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.710
Did you hear that, everyone?

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.410
These kids won't be any help.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.260
They want two S-rank
cards from each team.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.030
That's ten cards they'd take.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.550
Don't be a fool.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.060
I'm only taking cards from your team.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.800
Huh?

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.700
I'm fine with giving information
to the other four.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.660
I'll let them decide
what to offer in return.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.650
But I won't tell you anything
until you meet my condition.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.780
You are a stupid brat...

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.670
Throwing a tantrum because
I didn't baby you, huh?

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.600
Stop this, both of you...

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.550
We don't have time to
fight amongst ourselves!

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.300
I haven't agreed to
team up with them yet!

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.130
It's fine, Asta...

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.470
Give them two cards.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.310
We need to move on.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.490
What?!

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.620
I have no problem with
giving them cards!

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.310
But that kid's trying to pick a fight!

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.210
You're the one picking a fight!

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:04.390
Hey, let's leave.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.590
I don't want to team
up with these people!

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.050
Come, now...
Though I admit I'm a bit peeved.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.830
But given the circumstances...

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:20.260
Genthru has these two abilities,
Countdown and Little Flower.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.840
So it's best to keep
your distance from him.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.340
Seriously? He got me...

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.500
Same here.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.240
He touched me when we
were making a deal.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.590
Me, too...

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.760
Sounds like a bunch of
them might be victims.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.720
A chance!

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.410
Isn't there any way to
disable his technique?

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.900
Yep, there is...

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.270
You have to touch Genthru and say,
"I caught the Bomber."

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.780
Stupid! Why did you tell them?

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.120
We could've gotten more
cards out of them!

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.490
That would have started another fight.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.120
The bombs can't be armed until Genthru
explains how his ability works,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.990
so if you keep away from him,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.660
you should be safe.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.000
Did you know there are
two ways to cast spells?

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.470
Yep, I did.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:10.130
A spell card is used up the
moment you say its name aloud.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.760
But it's possible to
keep reusing a spell.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.570
Huh?

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.230
For example, you know how a list

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.140
of players you've met appears if
you put Steal in your binder?

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.500
If you remove the card without
pressing the select button,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.770
the spell card isn't used up,
so you can keep reusing it.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.910
I never tried that.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:31.530
Yeah.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.660
You can buy all B-rank
restricted slot cards at stores.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:40.480
You simply need to buy from the
same Trade Shop over fifty times.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.590
If you become a frequent customer,
they'll start making you offers.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.900
Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.040
Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.550
Is that enough information

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.550
to satisfy you?

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.400
I'll give you another
card if you're not happy.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.500
Nope, that's enough, thanks!

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.560
I'm up next, then.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.490
I'm Goreinu.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:06.560
Nice to meet you.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.810
Thanks, everyone!

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.530
That was very educational.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.030
The question now is which card
we should try to monopolize.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.650
It's probably impossible to
monopolize the #75 we have.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.210
Each team can only obtain one,
and the limit is twenty,

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.200
which is too high.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.320
You obtained #75?

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.960
That's impressive.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.220
List on!

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.700
#75.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.470
Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
Currently, 6 cards are in play.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.470
So five other teams each have one.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.790
Monopolizing this one
will be impossible.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.230
What about the other two?

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.140
List on!

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.910
#9!

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.260
List on.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:47.240
#2.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:48.950
No good.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.180
There are three teams with #9.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.320
No one has #2, Patch of Shore...

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.740
We can make it work!

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.010
Guide Post On.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.780
#2.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.250
I know where to find it...

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.750
Soufrabi.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.150
I've been there before!

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.800
I have an Accompany card here.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.500
Okay, let's go.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.620
Accompany on!

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.590
To Soufrabi!

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.260
This is Soufrabi?

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.400
It's a pretty big city...

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.270
Soufrabi

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.740
Let's head in and snoop around.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.230
Search every room, one by one.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.400
Some characters may not
give you information

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.810
until you visit multiple
times, so pay attention.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.970
Okay!

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.900
Hey!

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.550
I found someone with information.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.660
Fast!

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.160
The pirates rule this city...

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.690
There's a legend about
an underwater cavern

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.670
called the Sea God's Grotto
located somewhere in this area.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.680
Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.520
A few years ago, having heard of the
legendary cavern and its treasure,

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.690
fifteen pirates arrived in this city.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.690
Razor and the fourteen devils...

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.710
The city fishermen were
all tortured and killed.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.490
The pirates murdered anyone who
knew about Patch of Shore.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.990
If you get rid of the pirates,
I'll tell you what I know.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.980
When we visited a few months earlier,
we couldn't find a single clue.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.200
This must be information only
available at certain times.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.840
Maybe an event that only
occurs at this time frame?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.520
Razor and the fourteen devils...

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.830
It's possible that the event

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.210
was triggered by the
number of players here.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.020
Huh?

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.920
There are fifteen pirates.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.220
And it just so happens that
there are fifteen of us.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.280
So the event won't start until you
have a party of fifteen or more?

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.760
But how would a game
character know that?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.790
Oh, Accompany!

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:10.180
Yes, a group of fifteen or more must
reach Soufrabi with Accompany.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.420
That's probably the
trigger for this event.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.880
Brutal...

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.400
Huh?

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.530
Oh, nothing.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.580
Let's go to the pirate's base!

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.190
Gon and his friends stand before
some unpleasant looking pirates.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:45.510
Will the fifteen allies be able
to obtain Patch of Shore?

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:04.300
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.900
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.100
Today, we introduce the card
Tax Collector's Gauntlet.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:14.830
Tax Collector's Gauntlet
When equipped, player has
the ability to cast Levy. But
each cast will destroy a random
card from player's restricted
slots. (Cannot use Levy if
restricted slots are empty.)

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.970
If you turn this card into
an item and equip it,

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.880
you can steal random cards from others.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.580
And you can keep reusing it!

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.460
Clunk.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.970
Continue!

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.960
Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.450
Go!

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.050
I can't say that!
