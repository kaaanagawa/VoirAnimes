00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.970
5th Election for the 13th Chairman

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
In the fifth vote in the election
for the 13th chairman,

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.740
6) Botobai — 26
7) Mizaistom — 21
8) Morel — 20
9) Biscuit — 18
10) Saccho — 16
11) Linne — 15
12) Cutie — 10
13) Ging — 7
14) Sanbica — 3
15) Loupe, Bushidora — 0
Valid Votes: 633 (28 Absentees)
Turnout: 95.8%

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.370
Pariston placed first.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.620
But since he didn't receive
the majority of the valid votes,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.990
1) Pariston — 274 (41.4%)
2) Teradein — 77
3) Cheadle — 63
4) Leorio — 55
5) Ickshonpe — 28

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.990
those in the top eight must hold a runoff.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.980
What? Talk about my loss?

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.820
Cutie Beauty

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010
I haven't lost.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.000
Our beloved Pariston will bring my dream
of a cutiful Hunter Association to life.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.460
Biscuit Krueger

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.100
Yeah, that old man...

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.130
I mean, Netero...

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.290
I'm sure everyone knows
how crazy he could be.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.470
But there's one thing I can say.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.880
Just like in the battle with the Ants,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.640
you can't escape danger just
by being good all the time!

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.020
That's a fact!

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.310
Ging Freecss

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.770
Saccho Kobayakawa

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.740
Well...

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.690
I'll continue to support the
Association behind the scenes.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.830
I won't proffer any names,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.700
but I hope you vote for someone worth supporting.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.150
Sanbica Norton

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.290
I would like to thank all
those who voted for me...

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.190
But please stop...

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.040
Linne Hors-d'oeuvre

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
Sin x And x Claw

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.280
Yes, hello?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.950
Somehow,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.280
I managed to obtain a map.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.160
It has routes and destinations for all six airships.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.720
They seem to be on one of
the two remaining airships.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.260
Want me to send a picture?

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.250
I'll be using Texture Surprise to
change it a little, though.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.300
It's okay.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.930
An idiot over here was carrying the map, too.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.930
And I already know which airship Killua took.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.740
Okay.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.440
Oh, right... He has a spotter.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.700
Someone's watching me?

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.020
I don't think I'm so senile that someone
could tail me when I'm tailing another.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.960
Since the mission began, I've felt eyes on me.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.470
They're quite far away,
yet I can't shake them off.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.660
This is the first time that's happened.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.510
This person must be very good...

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.770
Amane, come here!

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.640
We're going to fly!

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.350
Yes!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.550
Fortunately, it appears that
clouds have come out tonight.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.890
Master Killua is sure to use
that to his advantage.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.730
As expected...

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.570
You're late. Let's go!

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.490
Yes!

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.610
Tsubone's power,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.210
known as Rider's High,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.350
allows her to transform herself
into various different vehicles.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.720
However, the vehicles are
fueled by the rider's aura,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.070
so she cannot use her power alone.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.490
When we're above the clouds,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.730
no one can watch us from the ground,
no matter how strong the scope.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.080
Amane, if there are any suspicious aircraft
around, we'll take them down.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.820
Yes!

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.740
Well...

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.430
There's still time before either ship will land.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.350
I'll help Hisoka out a bit longer.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.500
Nothing out of the ordinary here.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.970
The target has yet to appear.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.010
We've lost all contact with Point C!

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.100
Nothing has happened at Point A.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.510
Should we tell them to send support?

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.580
We can't assume that Point A is safe.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.130
Illumi manipulates others with his needles.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.320
He may control that area already.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.650
You're saying he's killed over twenty people?

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.010
It doesn't matter how many
amateurs we throw at him.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.700
We should warn the pros who are
going after the Needlemen.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.670
Latun and Kenzaki aren't answering.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.750
What?

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.540
The two airships they were
following are in close proximity.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.720
Most likely...

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.930
It looks like I must go.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.430
It's a chance to show that I'm worthy
to be Captain of the Seirin Group!

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.220
What about the election?

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.320
Those who are able should still go.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.570
Even if we exclude everyone who's hunting,

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.820
we can still finish in the top four.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.480
We must continue voting in the election.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.700
Even if we can't predict the outcome, I don't
want to manipulate it through absenteeism.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.230
Why don't we hire Association Hunters?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.100
If we show that we're trying to carry on
the spirit of the Hunter Association,

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.460
we could win some of the votes
that are defaulting to Pariston.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.840
He's right. We should move immediately!

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.220
If everything works out,
the Association Hunters will be killed

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.200
and miss the next vote.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.970
If I told him that, I'm sure Teradein would object.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.320
If we can't predict the outcome,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.000
we should force more absentees,
so it will be invalid.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.760
Teradein is too honest,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.940
and Bushidora can't plan well.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.870
Teradein-san has requested Hunters in
compliance with the Association's terms?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.340
Magnificent!

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.930
That's wonderful!

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.520
Accept the request! Do the job!

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.920
You don't need to be concerned about me.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.320
In fact, if there's no limit on the
number of Hunters we can send,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.390
spread the word and take everyone.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.920
If you come across anything you want
to ask or tell me while on the job,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.290
feel free to contact me anytime.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.260
If anything needs to be improved,
we can work it out.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.480
Yes, they make an excellent trio.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.810
I like them...

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.470
They're so easy to understand.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.130
6th Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 661

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.050
The vote's invalid because the turnout was 91.2%.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.050
1) Pariston — 272 (41.1%)
2) Teradein — 73
3) Cheadle — 66
4) Leorio — 58
5) Morel — 53
6) Mizaistom — 44
7) Botobai — 37
8) Ickshonpe — 0
Valid Votes: 603 (58 Absentees)
Turnout: 91.2% (Invalid)

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.930
What's going on?

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.550
Teradein!

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.200
Everyone pursuing the Needlemen was wiped out.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.810
Our members, the camera crew,
and the Association Hunters!

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.440
Even Bushidora!

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.440
Impossible!

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.860
Illumi must have hired dozens of strong soldiers!

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.630
More like one.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.390
Since we took flight, I haven't
felt anyone watching us.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.290
Which means we really were being tailed before.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.720
The clouds have cleared up...

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.350
Well, since we're this far from
the hospital, it should be fine.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.560
If anyone sees Alluka when we enter the hospital,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.360
Tsubone will say that Alluka's
power has been revealed,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.870
and she'll take us home immediately.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.870
But if I clear the area, that'll only
make it easier for Illumi to act.

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.330
Taking this airship to the
hospital would be difficult.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.210
Gotoh's idea to drive a car straight
into the hospital may be best.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.700
Canary?

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.140
I can't reach Gotoh.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.710
Neither can I.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.640
Then I need you to tell Hishita and
the rest to send cars immediately

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.940
to the following three locations.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.930
I understand.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.400
We've lost the ground pursuit
by flying above the clouds.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.220
We'll be fine until we're in the car.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.290
After that, we have to pick the
best route to the hospital.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.720
Gon...

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.770
Hang in there.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.720
Okay... Nice timing, Hishita.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.210
Since we had to loop around, it took longer.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.580
But now we're sixty kilometers
from the hospital.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.040
They can't find us.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.610
Take us to the hospital.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.600
At once.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.290
What's wrong?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.210
There are people in front of the car.

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.620
Those...

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.670
are Needlemen!

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.250
Impossible! How?

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.880
Following us should have been impossible!

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.310
Was it the car? Did they follow the car?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.340
Hishita, hit the gas!

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.640
They're beyond help anyway!

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.010
I can't do that, Master Killua.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.020
Not unless Master Illumi orders it.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.680
Wh-What?!

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.960
We're completely surrounded.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.780
Impossible...

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:31.840
How can he be here?

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.560
Illumi...

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.920
How?!

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.530
It's impossible...

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.480
Unless he knew which airship we were on!

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.470
No, that's not right...

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.390
Even if he knew which airship,
he couldn't be here.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.690
We flew dozens of kilometers over the clouds.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.600
He couldn't have followed us on the ground!

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.490
Kil,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.560
you seem to be hiding something
from me about Alluka.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.950
Do I use Godspeed

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.100
to get Hishita out of the car
and use it to escape?

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.520
Or do I go back to the airship
and try to escape by air?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.380
If I were alone, those options would work.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.470
But it'd be hard to manage
that and keep Alluka safe.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.960
How did you know we were here?

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.970
If I tell you, will you give me Alluka?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.270
Forget it.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.970
I won't ask.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.480
Alluka has an ordinary child's strength.

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.320
A single attack from one of the
Needlemen could be lethal.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.730
What do I do?

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.810
I have to summon Something.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.480
It's me.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.250
The fool who was completely tricked.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.250
Oh, it's Tsubone!

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.630
Your mother can see everything

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.640
that I see through this scope.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.880
She probably transmitted the
video to you, Master Illumi.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.020
Bingo. Tsubone served as my spy.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.810
When the clouds cleared,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.980
I felt eyes on me again and realized the truth.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.160
The timing was too perfect.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.040
Ah, so you actually felt us watching...

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.660
You're really something.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.440
Well, now you know the truth,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.150
but you can't remove that scope because
Mom ordered you to wear it.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.920
Yes, you're completely right.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.920
Tsubone,

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.930
give me the nail from your middle finger.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.430
Yes, absolutely.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.690
Here you are, Master.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.700
Tsubone, give me the nail
from your ring finger.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.050
Yes, that's easy enough.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.120
Tsubone, I appreciate it.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.520
Now, Master Killua...

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.980
Make your wish.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.720
Amane and I will take care of the rest.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:35.620
Please allow me this opportunity to
make amends for impeding your mission.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.920
Are you going to do it?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.520
Fine...

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:45.610
That means when you save Gon,
you'll follow the same process, right?

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.400
If you'd sacrifice those two to kill me,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.780
you won't have any problem sacrificing
a bunch of strangers to save Gon.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.510
Rule 5...

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.480
The same person can't make
two wishes in a row.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.260
Would it be more fun to kill Alluka,
earning Killua's wrath,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:14.860
or more fun to spare Alluka and save
Gon, making Illumi my enemy?

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.650
Tough call...

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.610
If you say yes, I'll be happy to die.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.700
Your inner mission will have succeeded.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.940
It's against the rules for family
members to kill one another,

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.540
but the thing that will grant your wish...

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.150
isn't family.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.260
Assuming there's a secret rule that
makes rule 5 not apply to Killua...

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.590
If my death means no other family
will die, that's acceptable.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.920
Killua will suffer for the rest of his life.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.750
I will live in his heart forever.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.780
Go ahead, then.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.220
I'm offering a deal, Kil...

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.450
My death in exchange for your word
that you yourself will make the wish

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.960
to save Gon.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.030
Alluka lives while Illumi dies,

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.850
but I don't earn Killua's wrath.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.840
So if Gon is healed, I neither gain nor lose anything.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.720
In that case,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.720
I will kill Alluka to earn Killua's wrath,

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.010
then take out Killua to earn Illumi's wrath.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.550
That is the best choice...

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.360
Something,

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.000
heal Tsubone's left hand.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.920
'Kay.

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:08.060
Hand. Hand.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.570
Tsubone, put out your left hand.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:14.030
Master Killua, but...

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.820
Just do it.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:27.030
Something is skilled at destroying,
but fixing isn't her forte.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.580
When she's fixing, she must touch the target.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.790
But...

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.520
'Kay.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.710
Killua, pat my head!

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.930
Of course, I will.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.670
That was amazing, Something.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.380
Something is the one who calls me "Killua."

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.110
Healing someone is tiring,
so Something must sleep.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.680
But that's it.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:12.560
Something has never made a cruel
request after healing someone!

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.330
Something is kinder than anyone.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.490
The one who's cursed is the one who wishes.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.210
If you refer to Something as an object again,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.820
I won't consider you my brother anymore.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.220
Got it, Kil.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:43.460
If you can heal Gon without any risk, that's terrific.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:49.110
But that doesn't change the fact
that Something is dangerous,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.260
and my questions remain unanswered.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.420
Kil, you're still hiding something.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.670
Such as how Milluki's rule 5 doesn't apply to you.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.620
Until you tell me everything,
I won't let Alluka go.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.090
Stupid!

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.430
That's why I can't tell you anything.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.950
If you knew the last rule, you'd...

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.010
No, all of you...

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.320
would put needles in my head again.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.520
Master Killua, I will take you to the hospital.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:35.530
Captain Bushidora, of the Seirin Group,

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:41.590
was killed in pursuit of the wicked Hunter
that we hoped to bring to justice.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.620
This confirms that demons are hiding among us!

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:53.090
However, I regret to say that the Seirin Group

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:58.130
does not have the power to bring the
Hunter, or Hunters, to justice.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.330
Everyone! This is an urgent matter

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.300
that the Association must band
together to resolve at once!

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:11.030
That is why our goal is to ensure
that voter turnout exceeds 95%,

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.630
and that the winner has a majority!

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.170
Thus, we are currently in negotiations
with Morel, who has strong ties with

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.490
the former chairman's faction, in hopes
that he will be our new captain.

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.070
At the same time, we are prepared
to reveal the name, face, and abilities

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.550
of this demon to prevent further tragedy.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:37.150
If you agree with our ideals, please...

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:42.380
cast a vote for Teradein!

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.480
Oh, uh...

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.640
I'm pretty sure I turned you down.

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.680
Can't you reconsider?

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.410
I agree that I was fairly close
to the former chairman,

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.400
and I participated in the Ant extermination.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.280
But I'm not a warrior.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.650
It was determined that my support was required,

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.580
given the nature of the operation.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.550
I wouldn't say that I'm strong.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:08.660
But...

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.330
Didn't you watch them introduce the top sixteen?

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.760
I'm a Sea Hunter!

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.300
I belong in the water. I'm a water man.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:16.740
I don't belong on land.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.170
Can't you adapt?

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.490
And if you're in a hurry to end the election,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.370
you could tell your supporters to vote for Pariston!

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.350
Though, I'd rather die than vote for him...

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.680
One last thing.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.190
If you release his identity,

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:39.410
you and a bunch of other fools will end up dying.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.320
And don't use the "Seirin Group"
name when you're so weak!

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.380
I'm not interested in teaming up with
people who won't heed my warnings,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.450
and I'm not interested in becoming chairman.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:50.290
I'm done!

00:21:51.810 --> 00:22:01.910
7th Election for the 13th Chairman
Total Number of Hunters: 635
1) Pariston 293 (46.1%)
2) Leorio 95
3) Cheadle 87
4) Mizaistom 72
5) Teradein 43 (Death confirmed during voting)
6) Morel 14
7) Botobai, Ickshonpe 0
Valid Votes: 604 (31 Absentees)
Turnout: 95.1%

00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.390
The results of the seventh vote call
for a runoff between the top four.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.590
Four remain.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.800
Is everything going according to Pariston's plan?

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.690
What does it take to move the human heart?

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.860
Next time: Approval x And x Coalition.
