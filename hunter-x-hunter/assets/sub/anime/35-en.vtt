00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.790
The ability to build up a shroud of <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.490
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.

A technique that nullifies your <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.830
It is effective for concealing your presence,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
and recovering from extreme fatigue.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.260
A technique to create an
especially strong <i>Nen</i> aura.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.480
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.160

The release of your <i>Nen</i> aura,

after boosting via <i>Ren</i>.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.650
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.020 line:20%
Four Major Principles

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
and are critical to the mastery of <i>Nen</i>.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.700
Yes, that truly was impressive.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.220
I can see the progress you've made

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.530
from these last two fights.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.630
Feel free to pick a time and place...

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.660
I shall be your opponent.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.670
The x True x Pass

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.410
Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.960
so he continues to train hard in <i>Nen</i> to prepare.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.590
Today, we will finally begin to train in <i>Hatsu</i>.

Act

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.810
Once you master <i>Hatsu</i>,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.660
you will have learned the basic <i>Nen</i> principles.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.150
After that, you will need to work

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.850
on developing your individual <i>Nen</i> style.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.200
Osu!

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.970
<i>Hatsu</i> is the technique
by which you control your <i>Nen</i>.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.430
It is the culmination of <i>Nen</i>,

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.210
and there are six distinct categories.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.670 line:20%
Enhancer

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.210
Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.970 line:20%
Emitter

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.470
Emitters can propel their aura.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.470 line:20%
Transmuter

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.970
Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.260 line:20%
Conjurer

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.720
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.230 line:20%
Manipulator

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.330
Manipulators can use their aura
to control objects and creatures.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.400 line:20%
Specialist

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.780
Specialists are those with a
special aura that doesn't fall

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.010
within the other five classes.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.780
The key is to find the power that suits you.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:04:28.750
Enhancer
Emitter
Transmuter
Conjurer
Manipulator
Specialist

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.450
The power that suits you?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.670
<i>Nen</i> is linked to individual ability,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.580
with two areas of particular prominence.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.810
The first would be your natural potential.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.590
The second would be potential
refined later in life.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.550
Gon-kun, for example,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.090
was born with a flexible, springy body.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.100
His acute senses were the product
of a childhood spent in nature.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.360
From the moment of birth, your <i>Nen</i> aura

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.700
falls within one of the six categories.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.560
While rare, it is possible for your
<i>Nen</i> aura to later change types.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.100
If you attempt to learn an ability

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.690
that does not fit your inclination,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.730
you will find it very difficult.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.640 line:20%
Act

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:59.490 line:20%
Enhancer

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:59.490 position:80% line:50%
Transmuter
Conjurer

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:59.490 position:20% line:50%
Emitter
Manipulator

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.390
This hexagon depicts the relationship

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.800
among the six categories.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.380
The closer a class is to your own,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.000
the higher your compatibility to learn it.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.550
If you are born with an aura

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.920
of the Enhancer category,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.160
you will find Enhancer abilities easiest

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.500
to learn and master.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.980
And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.220
will also be easy to learn.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.820
On the other hand, the Specialist class,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.650
which is furthest away, would be difficult.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.740
To illustrate, I'll use skills
that you've seen for yourselves.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760
Hisoka was able to change

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.660
his aura into a rubbery substance.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.250
This would be a Transmuter ability.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.580
Gido used his tops and body as
weapons by making them spin faster,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.500
which would be an Enhancer power.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.350
However, since using so many tops as weapons

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.890
also requires Manipulator skill,
he wasn't as successful.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.660
As for Kastro,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.560
his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.650
Had he mastered it, he would have
been among the strongest <i>Nen</i> users.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.550
I believe that his aura fell
into the Enhancer class.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.390
However, he focused his energy on
the power to create a double,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.870
which is a Conjurer skill.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.250
And he also required a Manipulator
ability to control the double.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.440
Both of those are relatively far

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.880
from the Enhancer category.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.900
So neither was compatible
with an Enhancer type?

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.860
Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.890
natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.440
And as a result,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.950
he squandered most of his <i>Nen</i> potential.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.880
So he made the wrong choice.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.610
He was a great fighter...

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.840
It's a shame.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.840
Well?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.930
Do you see the importance

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.040
of understanding your own
auras and inclinations?

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.130
Osu!

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.280
Given that,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.790
is there any way to learn which
category your aura falls into?

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.540
There is.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.990
Water Divination,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.260
a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.180
It's also used in <i>Hatsu</i> training.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.410
You place your hands beside
the cup, and use <i>Ren</i>.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.690
The result will reveal your category.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.650
The water's overflowing...

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.700
If the amount of water changes,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.630
that means you are an Enhancer.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.210
This shows that my aura falls
within the Enhancer class.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.470
Okay, now it's your turn.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.300
Gon's an Enhancer, too?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.800
The leaf moved!

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.670
If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.620
Okay, I'm last!

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.880
Nothing's happening.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.750
Indeed...

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.510
The leaf isn't moving.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.740
Do I not have any potential?

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.700
Not at all.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.580
Taste the water.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.770
Taste it?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.850
It might be a little sweet...

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.560
You're right.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.020
Yes, it's a bit sweet.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.280
Isn't this just water?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.610
It's just water.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.410
But the taste changed.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.770
Because of Killua-kun's aura.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.100
And that means?

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.920
You are a Transmuter.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.870
Oh!

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.670
A Transmuter?

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.400
Now, you three know

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.950
how your auras are classified.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.850
Use the next four weeks

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.680
to train hard, so the Water Divination
results become more pronounced.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.780
Osu!

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.190
June 11th

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.200
June 16th

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.210
June 20th

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.210
Hello?

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.240
This is Gon.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.130
Ah, I have been waiting...

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.250
Have you decided when we should fight?

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.730
Yeah, July 10th.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.060
That's the day!

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.630
Okay.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.150
I can hardly wait...

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.500
June 22nd

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.260
June 30th

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.270
July 5th

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.360
Now, show me what you've
accomplished with your training.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.410
Killua-kun, you're first.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.530
Okay.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.050
I'm done.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.140
It's sweet!

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.430
Wow, it tastes like honey.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.440
Excellent.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.490
Zushi, you're next.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.470
Osu!

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.580
This is the best I can manage...

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.150
That's fine.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.830
But it won't be enough to pass.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.440
You'll need to train some more.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.460
Osu.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.790
Gon-kun, you're next.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.090
Osu!

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.220
Stop...

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.270
Stop, Gon-kun!

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.280
The water increased with so
much force, it cracked the glass.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.530
Honestly...

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.530
You really are something.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.850
I was feeling pretty good about this.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.210
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.920
Today is your graduation day.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.790
Huh?

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:11.710
Really?

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.220
We did it, Killua!

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.100
Yeah.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.420
Master, what about me?

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.430
You still need to train a bit more.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.310
Osu.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.580
Keep at it.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.110
You can do it!

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.930
Osu...

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.620
And, Gon-kun...

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.180
Huh?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:32.440
I have something important to tell you.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.070
Something important?

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.450
Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed
the Secret Hunter Exam!

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.370
Huh?

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.720
You've passed.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.700
Congratulations.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.490
The Secret Hunter Exam?

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.740
Correct.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.190
You were able to pass.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.340
What do you mean?

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.540
You are required to learn <i>Nen</i>
before becoming a Hunter,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.100
as professional Hunters are
expected to be exceptionally strong.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.100
One of your basic tasks

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:13.800
as a Hunter will be apprehending
evil poachers and criminals.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.360
You must be strong enough to fight crime.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.350
However, this power is highly
destructive when used for wrongdoing.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.490
Revealing the existence of <i>Nen</i>
during the Exam would be dangerous.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.820
Therefore,

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.000
the test is only administered to
those who pass the public Exam.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.600
Oh, so you were going to teach us,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.850
or at least Gon, all along...

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.500
Yes.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.320
I should mention that the
head Shingen-ryu master

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.010
is Chairman Netero.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.090
The master has told me much about you.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.720
That old man...

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.140
Killua-kun.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.900
Please take the Hunter Exam again.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.730
You will definitely pass next time.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:57.520
Huh?

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520
Yeah.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.890
You are more than qualified.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.530
I guarantee it.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.280
Yeah, if I feel up to it.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.160
Hey, Wing-san...

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.500
Have you heard anything about
the others who passed?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.290
Sure.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.290
Hanzo and Kurapika

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.420
have learned <i>Nen</i> from other teachers.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.470
Pokkle is struggling with <i>Ren</i>.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.430
Leorio has begun studying for
the medical school exam.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.830
Hisoka and Illumi already knew <i>Nen</i>,

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.560
so they were qualified.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.700
Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.740
Yeah.

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:41.820
Now, Gon-kun,

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.450
I have one warning for you.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.220
When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.200
don't push yourself too hard.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.640
All right?

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.570
Yes, sir!

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.680
Zushi, you will continue
training for four more weeks.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.570
Osu...

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.730
You should have more confidence.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.220
You are progressing at an incredible pace.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.040
You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.820
One in a hundred thousand?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.230
O-Osu!

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:19.980
However,

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.740
those two are one-in-ten-million talents.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.430
Osu!

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.990
That doesn't make me feel any better, master...

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.440
But...

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.870
One day,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.040
I will definitely catch up!

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.740
Hello, everyone!

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.530
In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.970
This is the fight you've all been waiting for.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.040
As you can see, the stands are packed.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.160
The tension in the air before the
start of this match is almost unreal!

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.730
How much longer?

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.420
Get this thing started!

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:48.670
Gon is the first to arrive!

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.100
After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.630
He's on a roll!

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.700
You can do it, Gon!

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.740
Don't you need your fishing rod?

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.210
You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.710
And next, with a fiery display...

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.080
Hisoka appears!

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.260
His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.100
in everyone's minds.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.310
His record is 9-3.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.800
If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.110
If he loses, he falls all the way down.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.860
However, he has yet to lose
when he steps into the ring!

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.110
Will his undefeated record continue?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.630
Oh...

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.880
Don't look at me like that.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.390
Schwing

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.240
I'm getting turned on.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.300
What a sinister aura.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.640
Gon-kun, don't overdo it.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.900
Points and KO system.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.160
No time limit!

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.300
One round!

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.660
Begin!

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.930
This is the match you've been waiting for.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.670
The die has been cast!

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.340
Who will make the first move?

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.550
It's Gon!

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.170
A clean hit!

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.450
One point to Hisoka!

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.780
Wh-What an intense exchange.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.210
I never even got to sneak in a word!

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:53.330
What's wrong?

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.470
I still haven't moved a step from where I started.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.140
Huh? Really?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.600
Damn!

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.100
Just you wait!

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.510
Okay, I don't have to try to
hit him with every attack.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.110
I can use some feints to get the same effect.

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.610
Hisoka's enjoying himself.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.610
In terms of actual skill,
there's an insurmountable gap.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.120
But he still has a weakness.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.540
Hisoka knows that he's stronger,

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.620
so he won't retreat.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.000
That gives Gon an opening!

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.420
In that case, I'll try that!

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.190
There it is!

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.190
Gon's Stone Flip!

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.690
He shattered the block to
create a hail of rubble.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:20:59.450
Gon...

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.450
Where is he?

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:38.110
Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.060
However, he will soon receive a taste

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.530
of Hisoka's true power.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.110
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.440
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:15.460
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.610
Today, we introduce Hisoka.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.240
The reason Gon and Killua
began studying <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.200
He reels in opponents with rubbery <i>Nen</i>

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.940
called Bungee Gum,

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.010
and uses sticky Texture Surprise

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.790
A peculiar character,
who does things

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.440
to duplicate other objects.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.460
like stick cards in
his own wounds.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.790
Schwing!

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.580
Next time: A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.880
Go, go, Gon!

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.890
Gon Shot!
