00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
There are six distinct categories of <i>Nen</i> users.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.110
Enhancer.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.030
Enhancers are able to strengthen
various objects' effectiveness.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.960
Transmuter.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.740
Transmuters can use their aura
to alter objects' qualities.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.220
Conjurer.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.840
Somewhat akin to Transmuters,
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.140
Emitter.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.460
Emitters can propel their
aura like projectiles.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.860
Manipulator.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.440
Manipulators can use their auras to
control objects and creatures.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750
Specialist.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.690
Specialists are those with rare abilities
that don't fit in the other five classes.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.720
Begin by determining which
category your aura falls within.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.030
That is the first step to
becoming a skilled <i>Nen</i> user.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.650
Mito-san!

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.330
I'm going to find Ging!

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.300
After I've met Ging, I'll return to the island.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.270
Take care of yourself until then!

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.880
Wish x And x Promise

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.110
As Gon and Killua depart from Whale Island,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.850
Kurapika was also preparing
to begin his journey.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.400
You remember me?

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.270
Sure, we don't get many visitors here.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.330
Since you were here, only one
other person has dropped by.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.390
This place is much harder
to find than you realize.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.840
You found the agency on your own,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.670
so you must be pretty sharp.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.680
But I can't recommend you to
one of our valued clients.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.970
I have no problem with your lack of experience.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.460
Some clients don't mind greenhorns.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.230
But it isn't experience alone that you lack.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.270
What do you mean?

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.080
I said that I have a Hunter License!

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.450
But your exam hasn't ended yet.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.370
I can tell.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.680
What?

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.710
You can't see a thing, right?

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.210
Once you've learned to see,

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.180
return.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.770
You can't see it, but you can sense it.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.910
Why did you do that?!

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.160
This?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.620
Well, I was just playing with you.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.300
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.840
Consider this advice from a veteran...

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.200
You didn't notice when I stole this,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.010
and you didn't notice when I walked past you.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.750
Bastard...

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.860
Return my Hunter License!

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.540
Can a newbie who knows nothing

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.610
of <i>Nen</i> defeat me?

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.360
Nen?

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.570
Wanna give it a try?

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.450
Understand now?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.890
You still lack something.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.660
Come with me.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.030
I'll be your teacher.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.900
The real exam has only just begun.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.030
Today, we'll determine which
class your aura falls within.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.590
There's something forming in the water...

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.440
You're a Conjurer.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.810
A Conjurer...

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.160
A type that specializes in
manifesting their auras.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.390
I see...

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.560
Ideally, I would have liked to
have been an Enhancer.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.460
Can't do anything about
what you're born with.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.460
You can still learn Enhancer techniques.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.580
I'll spend the day expounding in further detail.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.670
Let's say you have a 100% chance
of mastering Conjurer techniques.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.760
From that,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.230
these are your odds of learning
the other techniques.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:10.240
Enhancer 60%
Transmuter 80%
Conjurer 100%

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:10.240
Emitter 40%
Manipulator 60%
Specialist 0%

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:10.240
Hatsu

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.410
It doesn't matter if you're a quick study,

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.010
you can never completely
master a different category.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.240
The further a category is, the less likely
you are to learn its techniques.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.000
Why is Specialist 0%?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.630
Specialist is a unique category.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.500
You can't learn Specialist techniques.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.960
These are very distinct abilities

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.510
that are genetic or naturally acquired by
growing up under extreme conditions.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.370
So why is it in this specific position?

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.700
Because the adjacent categories,
Conjurer and Manipulator,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.770
have the highest chance of
becoming Specialists later on.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.250
In that respect, your chances
are better than most.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.670
Remember what you said earlier?

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.280
I...

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.580
I need...

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.460
enough power to fight on my own!

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.340
You are correct

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.300
to assume that the fastest means to your
goal would be via Enhancer abilities.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.210
The Enhancer category
is the most efficacious

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.810
for bolstering offensive,
defensive, and healing capabilities.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.650
However, as a Conjurer,

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.550
you can only learn Enhancer techniques
at about half of their original potency.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.680
When you attempt to use an ability beyond
your capacity, this creates strain,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.260
which can weaken you,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.100
possibly fatally.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.170
In order to consistently come out
on top, you need a stable power.

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.690
Will the stable power gained through
mastery of Conjurer techniques

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.140
put me on equal footing
with master Enhancers?

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.530
The brief answer is that it would be difficult.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.610
Enhancers employ strong offensive
and defensive abilities.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.480
Conjurers usually suffer from an
inclination toward one or the other.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.480
On the other hand, this makes them incredibly
strong under the correct circumstances.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.790
Pop quiz time.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.740
Is it possible to conjure a sword
that can cut through anything?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.410
That is impossible.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.490
Why?

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.750
Because that exceeds the
bounds of human ability.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.650
Exactly.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.610
Even if you completely master
Conjurer techniques,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.790
you will still be unable to
conjure some objects.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.960
You could conjure a sharp, sturdy sword.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.010
However, it would make more
sense to just buy a good sword.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.690
Because it wouldn't require
any additional training.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.410
Though with <i>Nen</i>, you can easily make
the sword appear and disappear.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.270
So conjured weapons aren't as effective
as their physical counterparts,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.400
but you can't conjure anything omnipotent.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.220
You will need to reflect on what
it is that you wish to conjure.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.630
Failure is not acceptable.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.370
Because you will need an incredible amount

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.920
of focus, imagination, and training

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.350
to conjure a single object.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.740
This is a surprise.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.300
Learning <i>Nen</i> only took you half a year?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.180
So, what kind of employer are you seeking?

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:24.270
I have some information for you
regarding the spider.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:32.410
I shall await you in Yorknew City,
on September 1st.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.200
I'm looking for someone who has a lot of
influence on the Yorknew auction.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.090
The nature of the job itself is irrelevant.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.830
The Yorknew City auction...

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.950
Employers with a lot of influence

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.260
generally post the more difficult jobs.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.840
I doubt any of them will hire a
Hunter with zero experience.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.590
I see three of them...

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.440
Three employers who will decide based on
the interview, rather than your record.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.290
And they're only looking for bodyguards.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.350
I'll give you descriptions,
so make your choice.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.240
The first one is a gun fanatic.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.610
Specifically, he's looking for a Midget Corp.
Golsnake 55, Limited Edition, Series #001.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.790
The second one is a collector of fine china.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:26.870
Wants Lord Corp. commemorative
plates from 1655 and 1657...

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.650
The third one collects human trophies.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.580
Skin covered in snaking dragon tattoos,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.390
jellied infant skulls, etc.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.770
A fascinating hobby.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.870
Well, take your pick.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.390
Chains?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.680
Yes, when I heard about conjuring,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.760
that was the first thing that came to mind.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.790
Chains, huh...

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.150
Why's that?

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.810
Because there's evil running
loose that needs to be

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.160
chained down to hell.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.160
Really, now?

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.510
I have a feeling that you're
really chaining yourself down.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.550
What do you know?

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.280
Hey! Wait up!

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.050
I'm your teacher!

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:20.140
I'm not finished talking!

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.220
Hold it right there!

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.190
Didn't you hear my explanation?

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:27.220
Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.480
And conjuring unbreakable chains is impossible!

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.700
On September 1st,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.920
Yorknew City will host the
world's greatest auction.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.520
That's where the spider...

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.500
Where the Phantom Troupe will appear.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.150
What a fearsome heartbeat...

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.010
It plays a terrible melody of rage...

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:18.270
You want me to introduce
you to an employer

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.230
with connections to the Yorknew auction?

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.990
Yes.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.620
Just like the last person who walked in.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.280
Huh?

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.050
I got the same request twice today.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.240
That's amusing.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.540
The boy I just passed?

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.350
You know him?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:36.480
What?

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.460
No.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.050
He is interested in the auction, too...

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.080
Why is his heartbeat so full of rage?

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.310
That twerp will only make
your dinner taste worse.

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.550
We're more than willing to
take you on a date.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.940
We'll give you the best night of your life.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.160
Unfortunately, I am not on a date.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.890
I'm in the middle of a job.

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.520
A job?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.320
This is my employer.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.470
I am his bodyguard.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.170
Bodyguard?

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.060
That's a riot.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.510
This babe is a bodyguard?

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.440
I'd like you to guard my body.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.200
I don't guard ugly men.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.870
Watch your mouth, woman!

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.960
Just shut up and...

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.170
180-Minute Love Slave

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.170
Instant Lover.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.930
Every person I kiss becomes my slave.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.970
Please command me, mistress!

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.980
Beat them up for me.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.550
Yes, I would love to!

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.440
What?

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.640
Tsk, he got away.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.420
Man, I'll have to find a new employer.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.660
Such a splendid moon...

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.970
There he is!

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.590
Surrender!

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.730
Return the corpse samples you stole!

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.860
Don't you interrupt my work
or this splendid moon.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.730
Enough fooling around!
Hands in the air!

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.110
Tsk, I was on the verge of
another masterful poem.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.370
But you've ruined the moment.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.230
"A splendid full moon
and pursuers as clumsy
as baboons could be."

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.760
Damn, that's horrible.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.260
I know, Eliza.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.450
If this job works out...

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.650
Yeah, don't worry.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.180
I can take care of you

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.990
along with all of the dogs.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.490
You don't need to worry, Eliza.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.730
Just bear with me a little longer.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.750
Yeah, it'll be fine.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:03.950
You can count on me.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.640
I was sent here by the agency.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.290
My name is Kurapika.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.870
Welcome.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.050
Please wait in here.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.820
I apologize for the wait.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.500
Everyone has arrived,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.470
so we will now explain the contract.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.840
I'll start by stating the requirements.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.480
I won't ask whether you have a License.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.340
I'm only interested

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.650
in whether you can obtain the items we request.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.090
There's one month before the auction begins.

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.760
Before then, you must find one item
from the list we will provide,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.360
and bring it here.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:53.510
These are the data cards.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.330
Lock of hair of the famous actress Sara.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:07.360
Right arm of a mummy from an Egyptian tomb.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.270
An ichthyosis patient's scaly skin.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.010
Skull of a one-horned creature.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.760
The eyeballs of a Kurta.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.290
Hmm?

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.390
What's wrong? You look pale.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.770
Ah, Kurta eyeballs?

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.850
A-rank obtainment difficulty.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.910
"Preserve the scarlet hue
immediately following death.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.780
Preferably with the head included."

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.900
I've heard rumors that when Kurta

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.080
get excited, their eyes turn scarlet...

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.790
Shut up.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.780
Not another word.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.010
I'll say it again.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.050
You need only find one item from the list.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.930
If you are successful, you will be hired,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.520
to begin training as a
bodyguard and a collector.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.610
Best of luck, then.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.000
I will pass this test.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.820
First I need to curry their favor,
and win their trust.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:21.020
The man talking was, most likely,
not the actual employer.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.830
That only illustrates the distance
between the boss and me...

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.930
I shall reduce that distance to zero,

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.670
until the employer feels that he
can trust me with his secrets...

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:37.200
There are two things that
collectors always want.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.720
The first is any item of extreme rarity.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.100
The second is colleagues to whom they
can brag about their collection.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.680
He must have connections to
other human parts collectors.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.490
Collectors who share their
disgusting acquisitions,

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.370
a network of the lowest scum.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.070
I'll worm my way in,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.190
so that I can eradicate them all.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.860
Hmm? The door won't open.

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.120
I forgot to mention one thing.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.670
The barest minimum requirement
is that you be strong...

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:16.020
Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:39.300
Kurapika pursues his quest
to avenge his brethren

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.180
and to punish the Phantom Troupe.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.160
He prepares to step onto a new battlefield.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.190
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.570
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.470
It's Gon

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
and Killua's

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:16.210
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.310
Today, we introduce Mizuken!

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.580
He's Kurapika's teacher!

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.410
The person who taught
Kurapika <i>Nen</i>.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.940
He's classified as an Emitter.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.530
I guess <i>Nen</i> users are fated to meet <i>Nen</i> teachers.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:16.210
It seems he wasn't able to
earn Kurapika's respect.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.450
That's what happened in our case.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.090
Fate had a hand in crossing our paths!

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.090
Next Time: <i>Nen</i> x Users x Unite?

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:26.020
Hey, Gon...

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.570
Let's go break some of Milluki's figures.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.310
Unite for evil?
