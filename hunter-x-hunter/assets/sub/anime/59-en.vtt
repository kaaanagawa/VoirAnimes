WEBVTT

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.480
There he is.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.720
That's your target.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.740
The tycoon, Mr. Battera.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.290
Objective?

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.330
That would be <i>Greed Island</i>, of course.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.250
Why are you so interested in a game?

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.250
You've spent a considerable
amount on it by now.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.250
It is an expression of love.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.580
Isn't wanting to monopolize
that which you love natural?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.980
What is this love you mention?

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.510
There are many rumors flying around.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.690
Any comments?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.440
I will get my hands on the clue Ging left!

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.020
Bid x And x Haste

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.110
What time is it?

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.560
Kurapika!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.470
It's 2:00 PM.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.560
I slept for half a day?

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.950
It's been two whole days, Kurapika...

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.250
Where's the boss?

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.920
What about the underground auction?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.920
It ended up being canceled.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.850
The rest of the merchandise
will be auctioned online.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.340
The boss accepted that.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.060
You're lying.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.310
Eh?

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.940
She was looking forward to
taking part in the auction.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.220
I don't see her accepting that so easily...

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.700
Squala was killed.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.200
And Eliza was inconsolable...

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.320
The Scarlet Eyes we won were stolen.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.580
But apparently,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.010
the boss was severely shocked by Eliza's state.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.960
That was when she said
she wanted to go home.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.490
I see.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.440
What about Gon and Killua?

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.100
They're both fine.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.120
Around now...

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.310
He fell asleep.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.350
They're doing what they need to do,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.860
so you should get plenty of rest.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.620
Our next item

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.620
is the legendary game,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.660
<i>Greed Island</i> !

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.980
Let's take a look at the mysterious
power this game contains.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.510
As you can see, there is a mysterious power

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.900
that protects the console from any damage,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.160
as long as someone is playing inside.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.030
This man is Jeitsari.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.660
He is a player who's inside
the game at this moment.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.190
In fact, he's the one who signed a contract

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.920
allowing us to auction it off.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.760
So this copy wasn't brought here by Ging.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.930
Jeitsari left behind the following agreement:

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.990
"If we cannot clear this game

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.440
before the date specified in the contract,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.420
seven active players, including myself,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.110
will present seven copies
of the game and console

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.020
to the Southern Piece Auction,
so our talented young Hunters

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.450
can clear the game and fulfill our dream."

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.430
Unfortunately, when we
obtained these copies,

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.210
two already displayed game over screens.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.280
That means the players also died in real life.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.810
This dangerous game requires
that you risk your own life!

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.720
Make sure you're prepared before you bid.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.190
Let's start the bidding at 900 million Jenny!

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.490
I have 1 billion!

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.840
I have 1.5 billion!

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.170
#105 doubles it to 3 billion.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.160
#71 doubles it again...

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.330
to 6 billion!

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.360
Hey! That's my brother!

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.460
So you indicate how much
you're bidding with your hand?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.320
Yeah,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.870
the auctioneer is able to
instantly discern the highest bid.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.120
#16 doubles it again...

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.970
to 12 billion!

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.160
What's this?

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.320
#201 doubles it again,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.640
to 24 billion!

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.760
You idiot!

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.750
#16 bids 25 billion!

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.260
Whew, that was close...

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.040
I'm guessing he wasn't able to
decipher that memory card.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.520
#71 bids 25.5 billion...

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.020
How much money does he have?

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.790
#16 goes all the way up to 30.5 billion!

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.280
Damn it!

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.290
30.5 billion, huh?

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.790
No matter...

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.600
If we can clear this game.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.420
Um, we're Hunters.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.920
We're willing to help clear <i>Greed Island</i>.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.810
Don't joke around. Go on home.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.000
We're not joking! I'm a pro Hunter.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.310
What nonsense.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.060
Do you have a license?

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.130
Yes!

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.460
Uh, you don't.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.440
It's at the pawn shop.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.250
Oh.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.070
Uh, it's not on me...

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.830
See... He's lying.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.950
I'm not lying!

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.890
Hold on...

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.710
The fact that you're here means
you're certainly not ordinary.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.590
However, I can't blindly
accept everything you say.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:27.090
I am indeed looking to hire
Hunters in order to clear this game,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.250
but I cannot hire you at this time.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.600
Because there can only be so many players.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.450
Crap...

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.040
Has our plan failed?

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.240
I'm thinking that we don't
need to buy the game.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.610
We just want the data inside it.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.630
<i>And I bet some of the people
who win copies of </i>Greed Island

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.740
will be looking for players, too.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.990
There can only be so many players?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.000
Each memory card only has the
capacity to store one player's data.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.490
With multitaps, you can have a
maximum of eight players per console.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.010
Oh, right.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.560
That <i>Greed Island</i> save used up

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.740
all thirty blocks on that memory card.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.260
Yeah.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.990
How did you know that?!

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.640
We have a <i>Greed Island</i> save file.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.560
Have you played the game before?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.270
No, we only have a memory card.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.400
Does that mean...

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.930
If that memory card is real,

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.280
you would need another item to remove the card

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.200
from the console.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.290
Would that be...

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.040
The ring?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.520
They know about the ring, too.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.720
It appears that they are worthy of consideration.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.740
I assume that you can use <i>Nen</i>.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.180
Show me your <i>Ren</i>.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.050
Sure!

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.530
Well?

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.480
It's hopeless.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.440
Letting them play would be a waste of time.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.320
They'd run around in circles until they died.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.900
How can you be certain when we haven't tried?!

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.880
It'll be too late once you're in the game, kid.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.330
Unless you die off immediately.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.710
We don't need people who'll
drag out the inevitable.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.210
As long as a player is alive inside the game,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.060
you can't reset or remove the memory card.

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.180
In other words, you can't send in new players.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.920
I've hired around one hundred

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.060
pro and amateur Hunters to play this game,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.100
and over half of them have given up.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.360
Given up?

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.970
They've given up on returning to the real world,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.150
choosing to live inside the game.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.870
That is why I must be careful
when selecting players.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.360
We need people

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.060
who are strong enough to obtain items

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.940
for returning to the real world.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.500
And you're saying we aren't strong enough?

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.630
How can he know that?

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.930
Because he's a pro Hunter who
has played <i>Greed Island</i> before.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.840
Speaking from my own experience,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.580
the items for returning to the real
world are relatively easy to obtain.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.340
But with your <i>Nen</i>, it's hopeless.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.400
In fact, it'd be game over in no time.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.330
Once the screening is done,
I'm returning to the game.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.420
Screening?

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.490
You're screening players?

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.910
Yes, the screening will be
on the auction's final day.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.100
If you're interested in participating,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.920
you'll need to work on your <i>Nen</i>.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.160
We were going to do that anyway!

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.670
Let's go, Killua!

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.660
Before you go, kid...

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.110
How did you come by a memory card?

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.430
I'm not telling you!

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.430
Damn it... I'm mad now.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.050
We absolutely must pass their screening!

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.270
Screening...

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.420
What's the plan?

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.040
You even need to ask?

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.700
We're bandits.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.470
We steal.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.260
Let's return to the base and play.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.130
A memory card is already inserted,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.790
so only one more can play.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.140
We can use a multitap.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.320
Four more can play now.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.270
Nice...

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.330
So who goes first?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.650
I'll go first.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.400
Whoa...

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.410
He really did disappear.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.970
I was kind of skeptical...

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.660
What was that?

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.040
It's a game. Wanna play?

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.220
I'll pass.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.790
If I feel like it.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.660
Okay.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.540
Catch you later, then.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.710
He disappeared, too.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.680
What kind of game is this?

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.650
A game where you can actually die.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.680
It's listed in the auction catalog.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.230
I'm so mad!

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.440
I can't believe how he spouted off!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.680
Damn it!

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.200
Still, he's right.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.700
What do you mean?

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.790
Chill out a little.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.900
We should start thinking about
taking this to the next level.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.450
Next level?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.820
<i>Hatsu</i>.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.080
You know, our special abilities.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.500
Kurapika started learning <i>Nen</i> when we did.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.690
But he was able to fight the Troupe

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.270
because of his special abilities.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.760
Yeah, Kurapika obtained powers that

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.670
make him basically invincible against the Troupe

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.270
by placing his life on the line.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.490
We can't follow his example.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.540
We need abilities without
too much or too little risk,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.150
which still fit our specialties.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.840
Something practical and effective...

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.250
That's what we have to come up with.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.420
Well, I knew this would happen.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.770
Let's take this one step at a time.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:37.670
First, what kind of abilities do you want?

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.300
What kind of abilities do I want?

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.180
Hey!

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.680
You must have at least a vague idea.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.600
Uh, a really strong power!

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.180
That's <i>too</i> vague!

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.890
Start by thinking within your own category.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.310
You're an Enhancer,

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.880
so think of a power that strengthens something.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.390
Then we ask,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.550
what part of you do you
want to strengthen, and how?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.730
That hurt!

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.450
What about you, then?

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.080
I already know what I want.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.160
That's why I'm helping you.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.140
Really? What do you want?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.240
It's a secret.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.340
Huh?

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.950
Gon, I'm going to go start
practicing my special ability.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.090
You keep thinking about it.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.460
Though it's possible that I'm the only
one who'll pass the screening.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.600
He'll just get distracted

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.360
unless I give him a scare.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.960
Visualize my aura fusing with electricity.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.800
Then I visualize

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.380
<i>the electricity being released,
while refining my </i>Nen!

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.430
But with your </i>Nen<i>,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.410
it'd be game over in no time.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.720
Damn it!

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.700
I'll make him eat those words!

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.650
You sound determined, Gon.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.100
Kurapika!

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.240
Are you better?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.710
Yeah, my fever broke.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.150
I'm fine now.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.680
He doesn't look fine.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.190
But if Kurapika finds out

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.160
that the spiders are still in Yorknew City...

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.300
Is there any way to stop him?

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.440
So how did the auction go?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.250
I believe you were after an expensive game?

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.920
Oh, yeah...

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.920
Tea

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.560
I see.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.930
So they're screening players...

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.680
Say, what kind of training did you do?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.110
Once I decided to conjure chains,

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.080
I did a lot of image training...

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.930
I closed my eyes, while feeling real chains.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.900
I drew hundreds, thousands of sketches.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.840
I looked at chains, licked chains...
I also smelled and listened to chains.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.260
My master told me to do nothing
but handle chains all the time.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.780
After a while, he took them away.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.340
That was when I began to hallucinate chains...

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.240
Eventually, those hallucinations
began to feel heavy and cold,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.760
and I could hear them grating.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.810
Once I reached that point,
I was able to conjure chains.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.800
Other than that, I did the same training as you.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.170
<i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.240
I know, Kurapika...

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.070
You can be my master!

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.130
You can point out what I'm doing right.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:52.820
This way, I can keep Kurapika occupied
while the auction takes place.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.090
I'm sorry, but I cannot.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:55.780
Huh?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.200
My boss will be leaving tomorrow.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.080
I am obligated to accompany her.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.890
You're leaving Yorknew City?

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.840
Yeah.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.610
I'm still concerned about the spiders...

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.390
But it's been two days,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.880
so they're probably already gone.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.350
Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.110
Who taught you <i>Nen</i>?

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.850
You should probably

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.190
ask them rather than me.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.360
Special abilities?
That sounds like you boys.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.350
I can tell you right now

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.200
that Enhancers don't need special abilities.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.620
Why not?

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.890
Because Enhancers are the

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.840
most balanced between offense and defense.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.890
If you master <i>Ten</i> and <i>Ren</i>,

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:47.000
those will be strong enough to be
considered special abilities.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.750
But I don't have time.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.870
I have to pass a screening in four days...

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.760
Gon-kun,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.620
if I were a judge,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.640
I would be disappointed to see
an improvised special ability.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:01.990
Listen carefully, Gon-kun.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:06.270
You must not emulate that Kurapika person.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.320
I'm sure you don't need me to tell you why.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.200
No...

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:16.410
You needn't emulate anyone else

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.540
when you're already so strong.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.810
You think so?

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:21.730
Of course.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.420
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.850
That should help you find the answer you seek.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.410
A-A hint...

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.720
Please give me a hint!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.930
You sound pretty flustered...

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.650
Haste makes waste.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.950
In the end, hard work always pays off.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.440
I would agree if it weren't for this deadline...

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.900
All right, here's a big hint, then.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:56.990
You only showed that Tsezgerra
person your normal <i>Ren</i>, right?

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.700
Yeah.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.080
Next time, show him everything simultaneously.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.800
Everything?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.930
Yes, listen carefully.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.090
Show him everything you've
learned simultaneously.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.860
Everything I've learned simultaneously.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.020
Ten...

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.410
Shroud myself in aura.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.080
Zetsu...

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.910
Suppress my aura.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.170
Ren...

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.940
Bring forth an incredible amount of aura.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.250
<i>And </i>Hatsu...

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.500
Wait.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.080
Ren <i>requires me to bring forth aura,</i>

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.630
<i>while</i> Zetsu <i>requires suppressing it.</i>

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.620
If I do them both at once...

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.540
Oh?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.070
His brain fried again?

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.510
Hang in there, Gon.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.880
If you take too long,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.310
I'll leave you behind!

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.830
It's impossible...

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:02.890
How do I bring forth and suppress
something at the same time?

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.640
Reflect on the things you've been able to do.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.570
<i>After Wing-san helped unleash my </i>Nen,

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.860
<i>I went into battle knowing only </i>Ten,

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.000
and got myself seriously hurt.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.190
<i>But in the process, I mastered</i> Zetsu.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.790
<i>Then I learned</i> Gyo <i>to see through
Hisoka's special ability.</i>

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.410
Gyo?

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:31.170
Right! I have <i>Gyo</i>!

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:32.930
Gyo...

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.680
Concentrate aura in your eyes

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.600
to see hidden aura.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.290
Concentrate?

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.870
Right, I concentrated on my eyes,

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.470
so I never noticed what else was happening.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.560
There's a little aura being released.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.320
If I can suppress it,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.090
I'll be doing everything at once!

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:03.320
Yes! I did it!

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.360
No good...

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.830
The second I relaxed, it fell apart.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.720
But it works!

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.900
<i>If I can concentrate the aura
from my </i>Ren <i>in one place,</i>

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.200
that'll be a lot of power.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.280
I want to test that power!

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.070
Gon-kun, haste makes waste.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.380
Osu!

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.150
He finally figured something out.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.800
You won't beat me, Gon!

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.020
The two boys are about to
undergo a new awakening.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:14.250
G.I. Tutorial

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.060
Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.040
Today is the first episode
of Greed Island Tutorial!

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.870
What does "tutorial" mean?

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.200
It's like an instruction manual.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.350
Each week, we'll explain how the game works.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.170
Click.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.440
Continue!

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.260
Next time: End x And x Beginning.

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.130
Book!

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.130
Achoo!

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:26.750
Game!

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:27.600
Boom!

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.640
What's your name?

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.280
Gon!

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.240
Good job.
