WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.730
Someone's running around
and disabling my puppets.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.610
Can you kill them?

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.940
You can count on me.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.470
Hmm... No problem.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.660
You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.250
I will stop them all.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
Tracking x And x Pursuit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.910
Knuckle and Shoot are on the
move to capture Cheetu

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.660
as he attempts to return to the King.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.630
He's close.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.530
Okay.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.000
He's following the road.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.010
If he continues on it,
he'll pass by in ten minutes.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.750
Do you think he'll stick to the road?

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.470
No, he'll notice my presence
just before he gets here.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.030
Because APR will start adding interest again.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.530
But given his speed...

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.980
We may be able to attack him
just before APR adds interest.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.910
I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
Chapter 7 Bankruptcy

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.920
Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.540
attaches APR to an enemy.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.470
Every ten seconds, APR informs the
enemy that interest will be added.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.850
But if the enemy is over a hundred meters
away from Knuckle, the interest stops.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.830
When this happens, the time
until the next interest payment

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.150
is remembered by APR.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.980
Once the enemy is back within
Knuckle's hundred-meter range,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.030
APR picks up where it stopped.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.080
He's approaching at a speed between
160 and 180 kilometers per hour.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.830
If there are still three seconds or more
before APR adds interest again,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.130
there's a good chance we can
attack before he notices us.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.880
Here he comes!

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.620
What's wrong?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.850
Damn, what happened?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.080
At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.940
He's down below!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.700
Knuckle...

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.300
Don't bother. We can't catch up.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.820
Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.530
He isn't supposed to know
how to deal with <i>Zetsu</i>.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.020
How did he discover our ambush?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.500
Could it be...

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.420
We're slightly downwind.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.510
The breeze is blowing this way
with no change in direction.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.790
So he didn't smell us.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.610
Look up!

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.680
What's that?

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.790
I've discovered two suspicious figures.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.690
What should I do?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.500
Ignore them. They aren't the target.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.440
No point in doing more work than necessary.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.190
Yes, sir.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.830
It appears they were trying
to ambush Cheetu-sama.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.950
Oh, he's in the area?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.830
I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.660
Was that unnecessary?

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.150
What did Cheetu do?

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.230
He took a detour toward the capital.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.010
He told me to thank you for the help.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.840
I see, good work.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.870
He owes me now.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.510
This is Leol.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.700
The target just engaged a squad of
soldiers in the city of Longtong.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.770
Longtong?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.880
Head north and try to cut it off.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.520
Just a hunch.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.850
Understood.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.230
Looks like even the army can't handle this.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.840
No... Well, they're only there to buy time.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.120
They've had to stay in one area
for a longer period of time.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.680
After all, it's been moving constantly
for over thirty hours.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.380
Diego has fallen into enemy hands!

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.640
If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.050
Liar!

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.890
Rebel scum!

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.770
Damn... Diego just appeared on TV,
looking alive and well.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.410
The odds are against me now.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.400
I'll have to give up my instigation.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.020
My only option is to take out as many
puppets and soldiers as I can!

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.410
Should I go north next?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.210
I knew it.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.340
Someone's still following me!

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.430
Who's there?!

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.360
If you want something, show yourself!

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.400
The presence has completely vanished.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.430
It might be following me until
more Chimera Ants show up.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.360
I'm gonna shake it!

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.860
It can't outlast me!

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.760
Yo...

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.410
Yo.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.080
Sorry for stopping you.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.630
Nah, I was headed this way.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.950
The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.080
Yeah, I know. It's Leol now.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.050
Then you did that on purpose?

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.840
You're still a bastard.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.630
Flutter's warning was a big help.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.810
Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights...

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.870
I'm glad to hear that.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.220
By the way, what's that thing?

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.820
No idea.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.250
A Hunter hit me with it.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.310
It follows me wherever I run.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.230
Not sure what to do.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.290
But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.160
Want me to get rid of it?

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.740
Do you want me to get rid of it?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.430
You can do that?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.370
Probably.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.620
But not for free, right?

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.380
I'm glad you're so understanding.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.940
Figured.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.160
The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.040
I'd like your help.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.380
Leol-sama...

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.350
I've spotted the target.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.390
He's headed north on the road through
the forest northeast of Longtong.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.050
Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.210
Don't let him get away.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.410
Use all your forces to slow him down.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.400
Yes, sir.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.510
We're chasing down a human.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.990
He's probably a Hunter.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.260
And you want me to help hunt him?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.410
You said he's a Hunter?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.380
They can be tough to deal with...

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.180
Of course, so I've planned ahead.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.850
Shaiapouf-dono has prepared
a power tailored for you.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.430
He will teach you to use it.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.050
With luck, you can master it in a day.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.460
I'm a slow learner, so mine took me
three days to get the hang of.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.540
Sounds like a sweet deal...

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.950
In return, I swear loyalty to the King?

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.040
Exactly... Easy enough, right?

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.310
Sure, I just wanted an explanation.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.850
You're a sharp fellow.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.950
If you accept, return to the castle,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.140
master your new power,
and then contact me.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.270
In the meantime, I'll have my underlings
determine the target's abilities.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.570
Well, I guess I owe you one.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:48.990
Might as well.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:53.080
Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.210
Naturally.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.980
I was once king of the jungle.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.800
Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.130
Damn, I'm being followed.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.520
And he's way out of yo-yo range.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.240
If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.500
There's a jungle over there!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.810
The leaves are dense enough,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.270
he shouldn't be able to see me from the air.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.790
If he descends to follow,
he'll be in range of my yo-yo!

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.340
He isn't coming?

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.760
Did I lose him?

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.010
But in that case, he should
come looking for me.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.010
Damn...

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.860
I don't have time to wait around!

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.530
Hurry up, already!

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.530
You can't hide from me.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.230
Go forth, soldiers of Leol.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.290
Capture your prey!

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.390
Something's coming, but from the opposite side,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.550
and it's on the ground!

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.320
He removed his foe's head
and arms with one swing!

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.770
I can't beat him in a one-on-one,
close-quarters fight...

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.480
Where is he?!

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.900
Captain! Above you!

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.240
I'm gonna die—

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.980
I missed two of them!

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.170
We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
and we can't even touch him!

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:11.900
Retreat!

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.980
Time to regroup!

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.110
I won't let you escape...

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.110
You must be the leader.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.940
I'll eliminate you first!

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.800
How'd you like that blast?

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.890
That bastard...

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.690
He blew a fart at me!

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.410
No, there's a bigger problem...

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.440
I completely concealed my presence,
and attacked from his blind spot.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.750
But he countered at the perfect time.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.980
Someone must be instructing
him from a distance.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:04.790
It must be him!

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.040
He's probably watching right now.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.670
I'd guess he has a power that
lets him track my location.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.300
In that case...

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.680
I can't show him the cards
in my hand, no matter what.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.110
I don't want them to learn
of my lightning or yo-yo!

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.390
The ideal scenario would be to lose
them and go back into hiding.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.930
But that's looking impossible.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.840
I'll have to defeat them all without using—

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.360
A gun?

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.430
No...

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.440
There's something stuck to my face...

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.960
A flea?

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:50.430
A flea?

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:55.290
Damn!

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.510
Where did it come from?!

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.670
Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.320
Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.770
Okay.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.740
There's no escaping...

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:30.400
from my Fleadom, oh yeah.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.960
Damn!

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.730
The bleeding won't stop.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.150
These fleas are more than just big bugs...

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.220
Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.090
Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.400
Okay.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.140
The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.670
The real goal is to exhaust my
strength through blood loss!

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:29.930
My fleas are very special...

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.430
They have a 200-meter vertical leap.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.690
And when you factor in...

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.690
my air gun's power,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.120
they become unstoppable, oh yeah.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.150
Oh? He's already able to dodge them?

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.260
No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.850
If I keep running around, it'll be
harder for them to snipe me!

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.890
But I have to conserve stamina.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.590
Ah, he's going to try something.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.830
He may try to use his power.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.240
Let's see what he can do.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.970
Okay.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.410
My Super Eye allows me to observe a target

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.710
from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.430
No ability you use can escape my sight.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.450
Now, let's see what you do.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.520
Killua cannot use <i>En</i>.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:12.280
Expanding his aura around him
and maintaining it for a long time

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.230
is by no means his forte.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.520
Killua knows this shortcoming.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.700
And so, he keeps his aura within
the range he can best manage.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.360
A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.340
Not much room to work with.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:32.970
In other words, the moment a projectile is
within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.500
Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.060
and physical strength to react
with desperate speed,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.760
and dodge at point-blank range.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.860
But this time, he didn't dodge!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.620
All to determine the angle of
the projectile's approach.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.910
Damn... It came from this way!

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.880
He let himself be hit, so he
could locate the sniper.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.310
The target is quickly heading your way.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.390
Okay.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:17.640
I somewhat expected this.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.980
The bleeding's stopped anywhere
that the fleas only scratched me.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.320
They must secrete some chemical that
stops blood from clotting naturally.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.440
If I start bleeding in too many
places, I'll be in trouble.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.910
I can't let him escape!

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.230
This is perfect.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.240
I can see clearly in every direction.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.130
How do you like this?

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.670
There's nowhere for you to hide!

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:49.670
Bring it on!

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.340
Wait!

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.060
This desert is massive.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.100
If you don't have any water,
you'll die of thirst in a day.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.350
Too bad...

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.390
I wanted to observe you a little longer,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.170
but I guess that won't work.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.960
I was running low on stamina, anyway.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.480
I suppose this gives us more
time to talk things over...

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.060
Let's begin with introductions.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.430
My name is Jail...
Scratch that, it's Meleoron.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.020
When the Queen was still alive,
I was a Squadron Leader.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.420
Nice to meet you.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.690
What's your name?

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.940
Why were you following me?

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.100
Because I didn't want to let you get away.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.450
And I certainly couldn't let you die...

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.450
Because you'll be a valuable partner.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.860
You have business with the King, right?

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.870
I do not!

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.520
Huh?

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.960
That was dangerous...

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.710
He must have a reason for approaching me.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.090
I can't tell him anything.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.400
Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.550
"You guys"?

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.720
Yep... I've been watching you since
that other kid was with you.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.230
I understand.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:33.440
And you felt that I would put up
less of a fight than Killua!

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.150
Huh? Eh?!

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.540
You've got it all wrong!

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.360
That's how you interpret it?

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.730
I guess it makes sense...

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.190
To you, I'd look like an enemy.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.880
I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.120
Listen up.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.130
I swear that I'm not lying.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:53.630
I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.880
Okay, I believe you.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.950
Of course... It's hard to believe!

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.520
I can sympathize.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.550
If I were in your shoes...

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.270
Eh?

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.810
Is that him?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.160
This is a trap.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.510
You still wanna come?

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.730
Couldn't care less.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.600
Die.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.790
He instantly acted to kill me...

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.420
No hesitation at all.

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.000
I'm impressed!

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.150
An underground lake?

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.360
Lookin' for a taste of hell?

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.080
Here you go!

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.250
Blood!

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.250
Food!

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.870
It's food!

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.620
Wait, this is...

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.550
Captain Ikalgo's host!

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.750
Crap, stop eating it.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.640
I want to stop, but I can't...

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.260
The blood is calling to us!

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.010
Bastard!

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:30.270
How dare you chop off my precious legs?!

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.400
I couldn't let you drag me into the water.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:36.650
These suction cups saved me.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.780
Anyway, aren't you an octopus?

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.530
Don't call me an octopus!

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.660
Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.950
a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling
an octopus, that uses human hosts.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.920
Don't call me an octopus!

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.110
Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:27.020
What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:27.750
An octopus.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.790
Don't call me an octopus!
