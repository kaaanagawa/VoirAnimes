WEBVTT

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.860
Now! Kill him!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.040
Fake x And x Psyche

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.090
Hey, what's going on?!

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.170
Below us!

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.590
There was a huge explosion below us.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.960
Enough waiting around...

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.170
I'll see what's happening for myself!

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.850
Everyone, please calm down.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.480
I finally managed to contact the Ten Dons.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.500
They wish to speak to you directly.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.740
The auction will proceed,
so please remain calm.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.420
Please enter the auction hall
on the tenth floor.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.750
An underground chamber where everything costs extra.
That is where you will sleep.
Never descend stairs that you didn't first ascend.
Do not compete with others at numbers.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.810
I'll be fine.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.710
This is the tenth floor.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.750
I'll be safe as long as I don't
go down any stairs...

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.630
It's all good.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.760
Her fortunes are one hundred
percent accurate.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.760
Her fortunes won't come true
if you heed the warning.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.590
So I'm okay...

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.770
Yo, everyone all right?

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.980
First, I apologize for taking
so long to make contact.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.280
Sorry.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.120
There's been a lot of chaos,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.780
but it's all cleared up now.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.790
We've dealt with the Phantom Troupe's leader.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.400
It's only a matter of time before
the rest of them are finished.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.670
We're letting the professionals
handle the hunt

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.810
so you can enjoy the auction.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.550
Tonight, we'll be watching the auction live,

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.210
so let us see some furious bidding.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.310
As you all just heard,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.360
the Ten Dons will be watching a
live feed of the proceedings.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.280
Please concentrate on the auction.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.780
Illumi?

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.280
Yeah.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.820
Where is my client?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.520
Right here.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.330
Oh, were you fighting?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.790
Is he still alive?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.260
Just in the nick of time...

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.180
That's a relief.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.370
Well, relay a message.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.070
I've killed the Ten Dons.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.590
Tell him to wire the money
to my account as agreed.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.420
Up we go...

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.060
Good grief.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.750
It seems we both get to live another day.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.570
Aren't you supposed to kill me?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.810
We were hired by the Ten Dons.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.820
Now that they're all dead,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.310
you are no longer our target.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.330
Really? That's surprising.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.320
You won't get another chance like this.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.360
Do you believe that we kill for pleasure?

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.600
We don't do this for fun.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.840
I refuse to work for nothing
or die for nothing.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.100
Did you know that I hired Illumi
to assassinate the Ten Dons?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.850
Of course.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.850
But that's irrelevant.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.780
We simply do the job we're hired for.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.050
I see.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.730
Say, can I ask you something?

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.020
If you and I were to fight one-on-one,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.370
who would win?

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.540
Most likely, I would win.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.930
Unless you decided to actually try to kill me.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.070
Honestly, you're a cheeky kid.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.280
So he could tell?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.010
What a drag...

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.050
I couldn't steal their powers.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.420
So you want us to wait at L Hospital?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.880
Yeah, it's more dangerous
here than anticipated.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.420
We'll send her over by ambulance.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.430
She's just unconscious,
so you shouldn't have to worry.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.770
But she'll be much safer at a hospital.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.050
Make the preparations.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.310
Looks like you had fun, boss...

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.870
Yeah.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.720
I'm a little tired now.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.230
You were up against the Zoldyck family.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.400
I wish I could've seen how
those two fought you.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.210
Fighting would be more fun than watching.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.950
Kortopi, everything ready?

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.630
Of course.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.660
I can't make living copies,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.380
but I can provide static copies.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.410
Good enough.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.040
Then we'll stick to the plan.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.600
Also...

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.480
Don't touch the ambulance that girl is in.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.730
Will we really be safe on the trip over?

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.250
If they planned to attack the ambulance,
they would've done so on its way here.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.770
And you shouldn't have to worry
about stray bullets anymore.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.880
It's the moment you've all been waiting for.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.000
We will now begin the auction!

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.010
Allow me to introduce our
first item of the night...

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.760
I was concerned for a moment.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.980
But all's well that ends well.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.580
And none of the leaders were hurt.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.020
We did well.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.390
Thanks.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.250
Allow me to introduce the next item.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.300
An executioner's blade made of pure gold,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.500
taken from the Yulu Museum
of National Treasures!

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.010
Let's start the bidding at 20 million!

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.420
40 million!

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.260
50 million!

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.880
I hear 50 million...

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.090
100 million!

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.500
I'll put him on autopilot now...

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.030
Next, we have the fabled
sacred jar of the Rai Dynasty,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.410
Inspirational Blue.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.130
The last pristine piece left in this world.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.020
Um, Inspirational Blue is...

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.710
Over here.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.110
Kortopi, this one is next.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.290
Here, make a copy.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.630
Okay.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.300
Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand,
Demonic Right Hand

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.390
Here comes Inspirational Blue...

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.810
Let's start the bidding at 100 million!

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.730
200 million!

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.100
330 million!

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.810
380 million!

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.320
Hey, there.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.800
Aren't you going to participate
in the auction?

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.650
What do you mean?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.820
The leader of the Troupe was killed.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.140
Why wouldn't they proceed?

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.930
Impossible.

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.100
It can't be...

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.360
We're just mopping up leftovers now.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.990
They're called pros for a reason.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.890
While your useless ass was busy
fussing over an ambulance,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:02.820
the Zoldycks got the job done.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.380
So you're not needed any longer.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.860
Just stick with your little fortune girl.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.360
Run off to the hospital or the hotel.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.860
Or will you lick the boots

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.120
of that old fraud who
failed to score any points—

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.330
I won't believe it.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.410
Not until I see a body!

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.340
This is the boss?

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.030
He's young.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.940
Cocky son of a bitch.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.310
Hey, don't touch his head.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.820
We're going to show his
face on the Internet.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.260
We found the other members' bodies!

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.700
Okay, I'm on my way.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.550
A total of five bodies?

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.200
Try to identify them.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.270
DNA, teeth, fingerprints, disease...

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.340
Try everything you can!

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.710
You can dismember them,
but don't touch the heads.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.790
Once we have their identities,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:17.930
we'll kill their parents, siblings,
relatives, and lovers!

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.270
We'll make sure no one ever

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.760
tries a stunt like this again!

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.490
Now, everyone...

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.450
It's time for our last item tonight!

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.290
One of the world's seven
most beautiful items,

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.020
the Scarlet Eyes!

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.600
With the Kurta Clan's extinction,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.320
only thirty-six pairs exist.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.880
This particular set has a
particularly brilliant red hue.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.900
Then, let's start the bidding at 100 million!

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.740
110 million!

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.590
120 million!

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.430
130 million!

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.010
150 million!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.910 line:20%
170 million!

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.160
Boss? It's Kurapika.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.240 line:20%
190 million!

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.500
I apologize.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.500 line:20%
200 million!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.150
I predicted incorrectly.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.190 line:20%
I have 200 million!

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.130
The leader of the spiders is dead.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:13.270 line:20%
210 million!

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.200 line:20%
220 million!

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.150
The auction is proceeding as scheduled.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.150 line:20%
230 million!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.520
What?

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.560 line:20%
240 million!

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.750
The Scarlet Eyes are currently
being auctioned.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.090 line:20%
250 million!

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.960 line:20%
260 million!

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.910
Should I bid on them?

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.080
Of course!

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.660 line:20%
270 million!

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.660
You must win them.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.570
Is there a limit as to price?

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.890
No! Bid as much as it takes!

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.140
Win the Scarlet Eyes!

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.160
I understand.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.900
300 million!

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.540
I hear 300 million!

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.170
Anyone else? Do I have any more bids?

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:39.800
350 million!

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.550
360 million!

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.540
370 million!

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.020
390 million!

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.920
500 million!

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.930
1 billion.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.070
2.9 b-billion?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.520
Yes,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.370
the skinhead who was in the
room with the assassins

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.190
put up a fight.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.080
Zenji? Damn him...

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.640
I didn't expect to spend
this much, damn it.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.210
Curse that pig.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.040
No matter...

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.790
This means that the community
receives more money,

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.590
which will benefit my reputation.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.070
As long as I have Neon's fortunetelling,

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.220
I can easily make back that money.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.580
It's not a problem.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.620
Well done... Good job.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.970
That's right.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.210
This is an investment in my trek to the top.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.790
In order to succeed,
I must keep Neon happy.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.210
She is my trump card.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.740
She always will be.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.730
As long as I have her...

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.850
I can throw money at anything.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.100
You're from the Nostrade Family?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.720
Congratulations on your winning bid.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.770
Is this the item you wanted?

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.680
Yeah.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.520
Bastard.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.530
You think you can just walk away?

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.260
Tsk...

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.530
Stop!

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.800
I'll blow your head off!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.540
Move.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.120
Don't be...

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.910
Just stop.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.520
I don't care who I kill right now...

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.300
Even if it's you.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:56.080
Who is that guy?

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.750
Yeah, I'm getting into this!

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.520
How about another?

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:10.800
Seriously...

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:14.350
They were drinking while
we were captured?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.890
Oh, you're back?

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.350
Come and drink with us!

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:20.950
Are you an idiot?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.860
We're underage!

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.110
And aren't you underage too?

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.940
What's your point?

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:30.850
In my country, you can drink
once you're sixteen.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.110
I see.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.120
Really...

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.240
I had no idea that happened.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.130
I'm amazed you escaped alive.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.130
The Phantom Troupe's that dangerous?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.810
Back there, one of the tricks
you taught us came in handy.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.370
If the exit is blocked...

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.600
Make your own!

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.100
I get it.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.600
I'm glad I was able to help in some way.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.820
Experience can sometimes blind you.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.440
A con artist's knowledge might come
in handy against the Troupe.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.370
Exactly!

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.680
There's more to being a con
artist than you'd think.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.210
I haven't just been drinking
myself senseless here...

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.030
I've been learning a lot from Zepile.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.040
And tomorrow morning,
we'll hit the auction.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.770
You guys are coming, right?

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.390
I'd like to, but I have to find Kurapika
and learn about <i>Nen</i> from him.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.370
Kurapika? You got through to him?

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.640
Yep, but we're waiting for
him to call us back.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.530
Hold on.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.400
Did you say you need to learn
about <i>Nen</i> from him?

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.000
I did.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.140
Why?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.910
He just learned about <i>Nen</i>
recently himself, right?

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.410
But Kurapika managed to defeat a
member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.910
Seriously?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.400
Yeah.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.410
He must know some secret about <i>Nen</i>.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.400
Some strength that doesn't
require experience or power.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.930
Yay!

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.430
Thanks, Daddy!

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.400
They're beautiful...

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.470
Are you feeling better now?

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.700
Uh-huh, I forgive you!

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.960
Really?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.920
I'm glad to hear that.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.890
Good work.

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.240
My daughter is doing well,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.950
so we'll head back to the hotel.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.040
Tomorrow, we need to buy
the actor's used tissue.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.610
And that will end the auction.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.990
I'll be leaving the morning of
the day after tomorrow.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.900
But I want you to accompany
my daughter as she shops.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.480
Kurapika...

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:11.230
We can handle the remainder
of the auction and shopping.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.190
You should get some rest.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.740
Yes...

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.740
Thanks, I think I'll do that.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.510
Is he really okay?

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.010
Hello? Kurapika?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.590
Yeah.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:48.160
You said you wanted to
stop the Troupe, right?

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.020
That won't be necessary now.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.470
The spider is dead.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:57.370
Huh? What do you mean?

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.780
Kurapika?!

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.970
Oh, a shame.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.220
I'd hoped to provide some comfort.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.540
The Mafia community was nothing special.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.530
We didn't even need Nobunaga.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.280
Shut up!

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.680
What'd he say?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.060
The Troupe's dead.

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.300
What?!

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.430
Seriously?

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.600
He hung up.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.560
I have no way to find out any more.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.840
Kurapika is now drowning in
an indescribable emptiness.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.240
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.650
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.950
Coming up, we have Gon

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.650
and Killua's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.300
Hunterpedia!

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:03.530
It's Gon

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.360
and Killua's

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.610
Hunterpedia!

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:16.000
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.370
Today, we introduce Kortopi.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:08.700
A Phantom Troupe member.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.450
A member of the Phantom Troupe.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.280
Beware of Gallery Fake, his ability to

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.450
A Conjurer.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.800
conjure a copy in his right hand

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:16.190
Uses his right hand to copy
what his left touches.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.370
of what his left hand is touching.

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.990
I might be a fake.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.710
What?

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.310
Note: He can't conjure living copies.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.050
Next time: Fortunes x Aren't x Right?

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:26.050
My horoscope was horrible today.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.980
Oh, there's a Choco Robo here.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.810
Lucky! So much for that horoscope!
