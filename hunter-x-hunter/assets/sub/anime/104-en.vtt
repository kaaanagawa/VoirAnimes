WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
How many are there?

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.250
Around five thousand.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.730
And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.600
The King must be angry about that.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.710
No...

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.360
Apparently, he's been playing games in his room.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.740
He's so obsessed with Gungi,
he's been skipping meals.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.140
Then what about all this food?

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.940
Should we take it for ourselves?

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.890
You want to take on the King
and his Royal Guard?

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.620
Don't make me laugh.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.130
Yeah...

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.520
Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone
is until you have enough strength yourself.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.690
They're monsters. I'll do as they say.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.570
When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.820
he'd probably anticipated that
things would turn out this way.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.990
Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.770
If you call him by his old name, he gets mad.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.990
Doubt x And x Hesitation

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.310
The suit with the glasses is keeping
a careful watch on his surroundings

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.000
while heading toward the palace.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.860
The puppets are useless against him.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.520
He's strong.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.010
What about his abilities?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.050
Like the others, he has used
only physical attacks thus far.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.390
Okay, let me know if he shows his power.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.700
Once Welfin and Brovada arrive,
we'll take care of those figures in white.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.400
I can also check out the
powers those two have.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.770
Damn, I lost sight of him!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.660
Leol-sama, it appears that the suit
with glasses is able to teleport.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.310
Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.290
Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex
Hide and Seek

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.300
It allows him to teleport.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.810
By placing a hand against a wall or the ground,
he can open a portal to access <i>Nen</i> space.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.470
He is able to transport people
and objects through that portal.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.310
Hide and Seek creates a <i>Nen</i> space of
twenty-one rooms, on four floors.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.340
Each room is isolated.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.720
The entrance shuts when anyone enters,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.950
so to return to the real world,
one must exit by a different door.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.450
It is possible to create multiple entrances.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.670
The number of possible entrances differs
depending on the size of the room.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.150
The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.790
So, as a general rule, one can only enter
and exit via the location of the entry portal.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.280
However, using Knov's master key,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.870
an exit can be linked to any portal.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.860
Nothing out of place.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.120
Still quiet on the battlefront.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.370
Morel's Deep Purple is used for
primarily defensive purposes.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.960
If a puppet encounters someone who
isn't an ally, it will keep its distance.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.560
If it comes under attack, it will
retreat, while fighting back.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.180
The puppets fight back by throwing
nearby objects at the enemy.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.380
They avoid direct contact,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.770
so the enemy won't realize
they are <i>Nen</i> puppets.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.030
That's a Chimera...

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.810
What is it doing?

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.390
We're pretty far from the battlefield.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.780
Is it scouting the area?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.350
There were strange dragonflies around town.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.790
I thought they were a local species,
but might they be created from his </i>Nen<i>?

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.800
It's very likely...

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.050
If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in
gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.500
The battle is on.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.020
Hey... Hey!

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.210
Aren't you gonna touch me?

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.800
Look how close I am...

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.320
I know you're awake.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.090
Whoa, there!

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.330
I knew you were faking it.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.080
You can't trick me!

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.160
With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.090
Give me some peace and quiet!

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.020
No way!

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.940
I won't let you get any sleep!

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.610
I'll keep making noise until you chase me!

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.330
Idiot...

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.800
If that's what you wanted,
you should have set a rule

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.160
to force people to keep chasing you.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.690
Looks like he's still getting
used to his new power...

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.910
Have it your way.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.480
I won't be getting up for the next five hours.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.490
He's really focused on making
this a contest of speed.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.240
Coupled with his constant need for attention,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.330
it's unlikely that he'll settle for
any other type of contest.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.000
I'm not gonna let you sleep!

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.870
Hey! Over here!

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.540
I'm within reach...

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.510
Get up!

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.800
Look how close I am.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.330
It's just a waiting game.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.580
If he gives up and moves away...

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.770
I win.

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.250
9-9-1, marshal.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.010
1-5-1, marshal.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.510
7-9-1, pawn.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.010
2-3-1, pawn.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.430
8-1-1, spy.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.020
2-3-1, cannon.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.770
9-1-1, fortress.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.780
2-7-2, musketeer.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.060
The marshal has been isolated...

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.550
I'll call this "remote concealment."

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.660
7-1-2, fortress.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.160
1-6-2, general.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.470
9-1-3, archer.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.730
3-2-2, major general.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.560
I'm done.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.790
Her initial placement was exactly as expected.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.430
She's shifting toward my marshal
without breaking her crane formation.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.320
Let us begin, then.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.690
Her first move will be to position
her archer on her right flank.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.340
She'll probably try a three-pronged
attack to end it quickly.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.420
But shifting her pieces to the right
exposes her left flank to attack.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.650
It's time to disrupt your rhythm.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.830
1-9-3, new archer.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.330
There it is.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.010
9-7-1, new spy.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.430
2-9-1, knight.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.630
Her three-pronged attack
and left flank movement

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.930
will cost me two pieces.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.940
But that created an opening in her left flank.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.290
She'll probably expect me to
go all-in from that side.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.340
But I won't!

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.740
Here it is!

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.270
5-5-1, lieutenant general.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.280
Each of her moves has followed
a set rhythm until just now,

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.460
when she froze.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.210
Given the current placement,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.190
I can attack through the
center in unlimited ways.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.310
There is no best move.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.610
With every turn, I have the
ability to extend the match.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.570
Now, let me hear you

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.000
squeal!

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.500
9-2-1, new lieutenant general.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.260
That's checkmate.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.520
You knew my strategy was a dead end.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.520
Dead End

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.520
Yes.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.780
Why did you need to think
before making your move?

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.560
You could have made that move at once.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.810
The King has moved this match off the board.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.910
A wrong answer could mean

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.410
her death.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.120
Your "remote concealment" strategy

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.070
is actually named "kokoriko."

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.420
I came up with that strategy...

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.670
ten years ago.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.790
Placing the lieutenant general in the center

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.660
to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
move I devised, called "general in the middle."

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.510
At the time, both drew a lot of attention.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.720
Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle
was a popular transition that tested

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.870
both players' ability to read their opponents.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.690
I was pretty happy

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:23.220
that a fool like me could figure
out a smart strategy...

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.960
But then, I saw how to defeat it.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.430
A year after I came up with kokoriko,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.080
an opponent used it against me
in the national tournament,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.470
and I figured out how to counter it.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.590
I won the match,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.410
but the strategy disappeared from
official matches and textbooks.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.250
That the Supreme Leader thought
of the same strategy as I had...

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:57.790
I was so honored, and touched...
My heart trembled.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.030
It felt like...

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.000
Like seeing my child brought back to life.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.650
That was how it felt.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:18.610
So it was difficult for me
to take that life again.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.740
That was why

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.670
I hesitated.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.020
Foolishness.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.020
I've had enough.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.340
Get some rest.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.330
Once we begin again,

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.120
you won't get any more breaks.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.290
Be prepared!

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.850
Y-Yes...

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.120
I believe this is

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:01.290
the first time the King has ever listened
to anyone speak for such a long time.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.800
Well,

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.230
it should have no significance...

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.810
Four hours have passed?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.740
He got bored and started reading...

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.070
That guy's too easy to understand.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.240
Oh, you're ready to start?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.070
Has it already been five hours?

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.480
Wait, it's only half full.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.050
Are you getting worried?

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.840
You just noticed?

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.850
We aren't starting now.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.100
It's already over.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.850
Look at your ankle.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.100
A rope of smoke?

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.600
That took a lot of effort...

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.830
I had to go all the way around
so you wouldn't notice,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.610
so it turned into quite a long rope.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.730
In any case, all that's left
is to wind up the rope.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.870
Now it's only a matter of time.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.380
Your turn to try whatever you can.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.460
But it won't work.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.700
You should take the smoke seriously.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.310
Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.930
You can struggle all you want.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.710
I knew it...

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.560
He won't attack me because
this is a game of tag.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.900
If I touch his body, it will break his ability.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.820
He has no patience, but he chose
for the game to last eight hours.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.590
I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.920
The pressure's on you.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.350
Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:18.290
With his back against the wall,
desperate for a way out...

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.360
He created a new ability.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.990
A crossbow and claws.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.090
He can fight at any range.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.560
Thanks!

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.990
You helped me gain an awesome new power!

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.860
Hey, do you know what this is?

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.010
It's a bow. A bow!

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.850
You sure you want to come closer?!

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.520
There!

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.270
I'm quite sure.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:04.530
Why would you want a power
that's slower than you are?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.280
Ah.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.290
Why don't you try those claws?

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.260
Then I won't have to walk over.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.290
I'll tell you why you lost.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.040
It's because

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.770
you're an idiot.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:32.330
Die!

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.890
Then you can never touch me!

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.100
This sensation...

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.200
It can't be...

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.150
Smoke?

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.270
No way!

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.990
Caught you.

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.060
Wh-When did you...

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.790
While you were reading manga
and laughing like a fool,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:01.000
I created a copy of myself from smoke.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.190
And I covered myself with smoke
that looked like grass.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.300
My copy went one way, and I went the other.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.900
The fight continues, even while one sleeps.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.680
You shouldn't have looked away.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.120
Looks like we're back...

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.430
Well, do you still want to fight?

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.870
No, I've had enough.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.940
That's a wise decision...

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.610
Then why not tell me

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:35.510
what would have happened
if I hadn't caught you?

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.720
There's no point in asking.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.940
Once I've been caught,
I can't use that power anymore.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.430
That was the condition I set.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.960
Really? I feel bad...

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.860
It's no big deal.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.980
I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.250
Next time, I won't lose.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.880
You'd better be ready!

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.970
His superior

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:03.040
is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.730
<i>who has the power to release</i> Nen <i>skills.</i>

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.080
So if the selection is carried out,
winning will become very difficult.

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.490
Gon and Killua made the right choice.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.470
We need to meet.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.610
Let's talk inside.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.860
Reinforcements have arrived.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.630
It's a crayfish and a wolf.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.930
Are they strong?

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.000
If I knew, my job would be easier...

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.510
Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.660
So it's currently a stalemate.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.250
Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.140
I suspect it's because I took out this one.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.910
Those dragonflies were acting
as security cameras.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.330
Come in, Flutter!

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.180
Doesn't seem he's going to show.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.900
Change in plans!

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.480
Without Flutter, we have no way
to know the enemy's location.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.320
Damn.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.280
When it really counts, he lets me down!

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.300
Should I call it off?

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.290
No, I can't do that.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.290
I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.170
We're heading back, then.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.100
Ah, hold on...

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.170
It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.670
Rental Pod
IOU Dispenser

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.930
Is that your power?

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.380
Yeah, I can use it to scout around.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.020
Don't tell anyone else...

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.950
I'm showing you because I trust you.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.370
Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.440
Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.050
borrow an ability in exchange
for granting the target a favor.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.870
However, two conditions must be met.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.250
First,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.350
he must have seen the ability or know its name.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.710
Satellite Dragonflies

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.590
Second, he must grant a favor.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:56.050
After confirming that his favor is not
free and is expected to be repaid,

00:19:56.050 --> 00:20:01.580
this skill will activate, assuming
the target agrees to his conditions.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.210
Got it!

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:08.720
Once all conditions are met, Leol's
dispenser automatically stores data,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.070
which can be checked at any time.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.480
However, if the target dies,
the data will be deleted.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.590
Flutter's fine.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.880
I believe there's been no communication

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.910
because he's unconscious or far away.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.500
A rental can be used for one hour.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.420
During the rental period, the target
cannot use the borrowed power.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.080
Anyway, Flutter is still alive...

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.580
Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.120
Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.110
verify the location of the suit
with the glasses, we'll start.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.130
So we keep the small fry at a distance
while you take on the suit with the glasses.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.430
You gonna be okay on your own?

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.070
Just trust me. I wouldn't give
you a job you can't handle.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.970
And I don't want you to see my power.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:02.140
I'll do whatever it takes to
complete this mission.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.540
Okay...

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.220
I can't afford to wait around here.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.460
Not until the King is in my debt!

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:16.380
When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and
tears it up, the effect activates.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.750
They're here.

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.790
Time to start scouting.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.690
I don't understand.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.590
This is upsetting.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.770
During our matches, I am the only
one who's getting flustered.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.560
I would have expected this to be
humiliating on a new level.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:43.490
But...

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:49.260
At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.210
But I don't understand why...

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.340
Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.380
Morel-san, what's in your pipe?

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.480
It holds...

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.590
Gulp.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.730
...tonkotsu.
